dune frank herbert book dune a beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct this every sister of the bene gesserit knows to begin your study of the life of muaddib then take care that you first place him in his time born in the th year of the padishah emperor shaddam iv and take the most special care that you locate muaddib in his place the planet arrakis do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on caladan and lived his first fifteen years there arrakis the planet known as dune is forever his place from manual of muaddib by the princess irulan in the week before their departure to arrakis when all the final scurrying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy paul it was a warm night at castle caladan and the ancient pile of stone that had served the atreides family as home for twentysix generations bore that cooledsweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather the old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by pauls room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay in his bed by the halflight of a suspensor lamp dimmed and hanging near the floor the awakened boy could see a bulky female shape at his door standing one step ahead of his mother the old woman was a witch shadow hair like matted spiderwebs hooded round darkness of features eyes like glittering jewels is he not small for his age jessica the old woman asked her voice wheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset pauls mother answered in her soft contralto the atreides are known to start late getting their growth your reverence so ive heard so ive heard wheezed the old woman yet hes already fifteen yes your reverence hes awake and listening to us said the old woman sly little rascal she chuckled but royalty has need of slyness and if hes really the kwisatz haderach well within the shadows of his bed paul held his eyes open to mere slits two birdbright ovals the eyes of the old woman seemed to expand and glow as they stared into his sleep well you sly little rascal said the old woman tomorrow youll need all your faculties to meet my gom jabbar and she was gone pushing his mother out closing the door with a solid thump paul lay awake wondering whats a gom jabbar in all the upset during this time of change the old woman was the strangest thing he had seen your reverence and the way she called his mother jessica like a common serving wench instead of what she was a bene gesserit lady a dukes concubine and mother of the ducal heir is a gom jabbar something of arrakis i must know before we go there he wondered he mouthed her strange words gom jabbar kwisatz haderach there had been so many things to learn arrakis would be a place so different from caladan that pauls mind whirled with the new knowledge arrakis dune desert planet thufir hawat his fathers master of assassins had explained it their mortal enemies the harkonnens had been on arrakis eighty years holding the planet in quasifief under a choam company contract to mine the geriatric spice melange now the harkonnens were leaving to be replaced by the house of atreides in fiefcomplete an apparent victory for the duke leto yet hawat had said this appearance contained the deadliest peril for the duke leto was popular among the great houses of the landsraad a popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful hawat had said arrakis dune desert planet paul fell asleep to dream of an arrakeen cavern silent people all around him moving in the dim light of glowglobes it was solemn there and like a cathedral as he listened to a faint sound the dripdripdrip of water even while he remained in the dream paul knew he would remember it upon awakening he always remembered the dreams that were predictions the dream faded paul awoke to feel himself in the warmth of his bed thinking thinking this world of castle caladan without play or companions his own age perhaps did not deserve sadness in farewell dr yueh his teacher had hinted that the faufreluches class system was not rigidly guarded on arrakis the planet sheltered people who lived at the desert edge without caid or bashar to command them willothesand people called fremen marked down on no census of the imperial regate arrakis dune desert planet paul sensed his own tensions decided to practice one of the mindbody lessons his mother had taught him three quick breaths triggered the responses he fell into the floating awareness focusing the consciousness aortal dilation avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness to be conscious by choice blood enriched and swiftflooding the overload regions one does not obtain foodsafetyfreedom by instinct alone animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct the animal destroys and does not produce animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the perceptual the human requires a background grid through which to see his universe focused consciousness by choice this forms your grid bodily integrity follows nerveblood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell needs all thingscellsbeings are impermanent strive for flowpermanence within over and over and over within pauls floating awareness the lesson rolled when dawn touched pauls window sill with yellow light he sensed it through closed eyelids opened them hearing then the renewed bustle and hurry in the castle seeing the familiar patterned beams of his bedroom ceiling the hall door opened and his mother peered in hair like shaded bronze held with a black ribbon at the crown her oval face emotionless and green eyes staring solemnly youre awake she said did you sleep well yes he studied the tallness of her saw the hint of tension in her shoulders as she chose clothing for him from the closet racks another might have missed the tension but she had trained him in the bene gesserit way in the minutiae of observation she turned holding a semiformal jacket for him it carried the red atreides hawk crest above the breast pocket hurry and dress she said reverend mother is waiting i dreamed of her once paul said who is she she was my teacher at the bene gesserit school now shes the emperors truthsayer and paul she hesitated you must tell her about your dreams i will is she the reason we got arrakis we did not get arrakis jessica flicked dust from a pair of trousers hung them with the jacket on the dressing stand beside his bed dont keep reverend mother waiting paul sat up hugged his knees whats a gom jabbar again the training she had given him exposed her almost invisible hesitation a nervous betrayal he felt as fear jessica crossed to the window flung wide the draperies stared across the river orchards toward mount syubi youll learn about the gom jabbar soon enough she said he heard the fear in her voice and wondered at it jessica spoke without turning reverend mother is waiting in my morning room please hurry the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam sat in a tapestried chair watching mother and son approach windows on each side of her overlooked the curving southern bend of the river and the green farmlands of the atreides family holding but the reverend mother ignored the view she was feeling her age this morning more than a little petulant she blamed it on space travel and association with that abominable spacing guild and its secretive ways but here was a mission that required personal attention from a bene gesseritwiththesight even the padishah emperors truthsayer couldnt evade that responsibility when the duty call came damn that jessica the reverend mother thought if only she d borne us a girl as she was ordered to do jessica stopped three paces from the chair dropped a small curtsy a gentle flick of left hand along the line of her skirt paul gave the short bow his dancing master had taught the one used when in doubt of anothers station the nuances of pauls greeting were not lost on the reverend mother she said hes a cautious one jessica jessicas hand went to pauls shoulder tightened there for a heartbeat fear pulsed through her palm then she had herself under control thus he has been taught your reverence what does she fear paul wondered the old woman studied paul in one gestalten flicker face oval like jessicas but strong bones hair the dukes blackblack but with browline of the maternal grandfather who can not be named and that thin disdainful nose shape of directly staring green eyes like the old duke the paternal grandfather who is dead now there was a man who appreciated the power of bravura even in death the reverend mother thought teaching is one thing she said the basic ingredient is another we shall see the old eyes darted a hard glance at jessica leave us i enjoin you to practice the meditation of peace jessica took her hand from pauls shoulder your reverence i jessica you know it must be done paul looked up at his mother puzzled jessica straightened yes of course paul looked back at the reverend mother politeness and his mothers obvious awe of this old woman argued caution yet he felt an angry apprehension at the fear he sensed radiating from his mother paul jessica took a deep breath this test youre about to receive its important to me test he looked up at her remember that youre a dukes son jessica said she whirled and strode from the room in a dry swishing of skirt the door closed solidly behind her paul faced the old woman holding anger in check does one dismiss the lady jessica as though she were a serving wench a smile flicked the corners of the wrinkled old mouth the lady jessica was my serving wench lad for fourteen years at school she nodded and a good one too now you come here the command whipped out at him paul found himself obeying before he could think about it using the voice on me he thought he stopped at her gesture standing beside her knees see this she asked from the folds of her gown she lifted a green metal cube about fifteen centimeters on a side she turned it and paul saw that one side was open black and oddly frightening no light penetrated that open blackness put your right hand in the box she said fear shot through paul he started to back away but the old woman said is this how you obey your mother he looked up into birdbright eyes slowly feeling the compulsions and unable to inhibit them paul put his hand into the box he felt first a sense of cold as the blackness closed around his hand then slick metal against his fingers and a prickling as though his hand were asleep a predatory look filled the old womans features she lifted her right hand away from the box and poised the hand close to the side of pauls neck he saw a glint of metal there and started to turn toward stop she snapped using the voice again he swung his attention back to her face i hold at your neck the gom jabbar she said the gom jabbar the highhanded enemy its a needle with a drop of poison on its tip ahah dont pull away or youll feel that poison paul tried to swallow in a dry throat he could not take his attention from the seamed old face the glistening eyes the pale gums around silvery metal teeth that flashed as she spoke a dukes son must know about poisons she said its the way of our times eh musky to be poisoned in your drink aumas to be poisoned in your food the quick ones and the slow ones and the ones in between heres a new one for you the gom jabbar it kills only animals pride overcame pauls fear you dare suggest a dukes son is an animal he demanded let us say i suggest you may be human she said steady i warn you not to try jerking away i am old but my hand can drive this needle into your neck before you escape me who are you he whispered how did you trick my mother into leaving me alone with you are you from the harkonnens the harkonnens bless us no now be silent a dry finger touched his neck and he stilled the involuntary urge to leap away good she said you pass the first test now heres the way of the rest of it if you withdraw your hand from the box you die this is the only rule keep your hand in the box and live withdraw it and die paul took a deep breath to still his trembling if i call out therell be servants on you in seconds and youll die servants will not pass your mother who stands guard outside that door depend on it your mother survived this test now its your turn be honored we seldom administer this to menchildren curiosity reduced pauls fear to a manageable level he heard truth in the old womans voice no denying it if his mother stood guard out there if this were truly a test and whatever it was he knew himself caught in it trapped by that hand at his neck the gom jabbar he recalled the response from the litany against fear as his mother had taught him out of the bene gesserit rite i must not fear fear is the mindkiller fear is the littledeath that brings total obliteration i will face my fear i will permit it to pass over me and through me and when it has gone past i will turn the inner eye to see its path where the fear has gone there will be nothing only i will remain he felt calmness return said get on with it old woman old woman she snapped youve courage and that cant be denied well we shall see sirra she bent close lowered her voice almost to a whisper you will feel pain in this hand within the box pain but withdraw the hand and ill touch your neck with my gom jabbar the death so swift its like the fall of the headsmans axe withdraw your hand and the gom jabbar takes you understand whats in the box pain he felt increased tingling in his hand pressed his lips tightly together how could this be a test he wondered the tingling became an itch the old woman said youve heard of animals chewing off a leg to escape a trap theres an animal kind of trick a human would remain in the trap endure the pain feigning death that he might kill the trapper and remove a threat to his kind the itch became the faintest burning why are you doing this he demanded to determine if youre human be silent paul clenched his left hand into a fist as the burning sensation increased in the other hand it mounted slowly heat upon heat upon heat upon heat he felt the fingernails of his free hand biting the palm he tried to flex the fingers of the burning hand but couldnt move them it burns he whispered silence pain throbbed up his arm sweat stood out on his forehead every fiber cried out to withdraw the hand from that burning pit but the gom jabbar without turning his head he tried to move his eyes to see that terrible needle poised beside his neck he sensed that he was breathing in gasps tried to slow his breaths and couldnt pain his world emptied of everything except that hand immersed in agony the ancient face inches away staring at him his lips were so dry he had difficulty separating them the burning the burning he thought he could feel skin curling black on that agonized hand the flesh crisping and dropping away until only charred bones remained it stopped as though a switch had been turned off the pain stopped paul felt his right arm trembling felt sweat bathing his body enough the old woman muttered kull wahad no woman child ever withstood that much i mustve wanted you to fail she leaned back withdrawing the gom jabbar from the side of his neck take your hand from the box young human and look at it he fought down an aching shiver stared at the lightless void where his hand seemed to remain of its own volition memory of pain inhibited every movement reason told him he would withdraw a blackened stump from that box do it she snapped he jerked his hand from the box stared at it astonished not a mark no sign of agony on the flesh he held up the hand turned it flexed the fingers pain by nerve induction she said cant go around maiming potential humans therere those whod give a pretty for the secret of this box though she slipped it into the folds of her gown but the pain he said pain she sniffed a human can override any nerve in the body paul felt his left hand aching uncurled the clenched fingers looked at four bloody marks where fingernails had bitten his palm he dropped the hand to his side looked at the old woman you did that to my mother once ever sift sand through a screen she asked the tangential slash of her question shocked his mind into a higher awareness sand through a screen he nodded we bene gesserit sift people to find the humans he lifted his right hand willing the memory of the pain and thats all there is to it pain i observed you in pain lad pains merely the axis of the test your mothers told you about our ways of observing i see the signs of her teaching in you our test is crisis and observation he heard the confirmation in her voice said its truth she stared at him he senses truth could he be the one could he truly be the one she extinguished the excitement reminding herself hope clouds observation you know when people believe what they say she said i know it the harmonics of ability confirmed by repeated test were in his voice she heard them said perhaps you are the kwisatz haderach sit down little brother here at my feet i prefer to stand your mother sat at my feet once im not my mother you hate us a little eh she looked toward the door called out jessica the door flew open and jessica stood there staring hardeyed into the room hardness melted from her as she saw paul she managed a faint smile jessica have you ever stopped hating me the old woman asked i both love and hate you jessica said the hate thats from pains i must never forget the love thats just the basic fact the old woman said but her voice was gentle you may come in now but remain silent close that door and mind it that no one interrupts us jessica stepped into the room closed the door and stood with her back to it my son lives she thought my son lives and is human i knew he was but he lives now i can go on living the door felt hard and real against her back everything in the room was immediate and pressing against her senses my son lives paul looked at his mother she told the truth he wanted to get away alone and think this experience through but knew he could not leave until he was dismissed the old woman had gained a power over him they spoke truth his mother had undergone this test there must be terrible purpose in it the pain and fear had been terrible he understood terrible purposes they drove against all odds they were their own necessity paul felt that he had been infected with terrible purpose he did not know yet what the terrible purpose was some day lad the old woman said you too may have to stand outside a door like that it takes a measure of doing paul looked down at the hand that had known pain then up to the reverend mother the sound of her voice had contained a difference then from any other voice in his experience the words were outlined in brilliance there was an edge to them he felt that any question he might ask her would bring an answer that could lift him out of his fleshworld into something greater why do you test for humans he asked to set you free free once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free but that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a mans mind paul quoted right out of the butlerian jihad and the orange catholic bible she said but what the oc bible shouldve said is thou shalt not make a machine to counterfeit a human mind have you studied the mentat in your service ive studied with thufir hawat the great revolt took away a crutch she said it forced human minds to develop schools were started to train human talents bene gesserit schools she nodded we have two chief survivors of those ancient schools the bene gesserit and the spacing guild the guild so we think emphasizes almost pure mathematics bene gesserit performs another function politics he said kull wahad the old woman said she sent a hard glance at jessica ive not told him your reverence jessica said the reverend mother returned her attention to paul you did that on remarkably few clues she said politics indeed the original bene gesserit school was directed by those who saw the need of a thread of continuity in human affairs they saw there could be no such continuity without separating human stock from animal stock for breeding purposes the old womans words abruptly lost their special sharpness for paul he felt an offense against what his mother called his instinct for rightness it wasnt that reverend mother lied to him she obviously believed what she said it was something deeper something tied to his terrible purpose he said but my mother tells me many bene gesserit of the schools dont know their ancestry the genetic lines are always in our records she said your mother knows that either shes of bene gesserit descent or her stock was acceptable in itself then why couldnt she know who her parents are some do many dont we might for example have wanted to breed her to a close relative to set up a dominant in some genetic trait we have many reasons again paul felt the offense against rightness he said you take a lot on yourselves the reverend mother stared at him wondering did i hear criticism in his voice we carry a heavy burden she said paul felt himself coming more and more out of the shock of the test he leveled a measuring stare at her said you say maybe im the kwisatz haderach whats that a human gom jabbar paul jessica said you mustnt take that tone with ill handle this jessica the old woman said now lad do you know about the truthsayer drug you take it to improve your ability to detect falsehood he said my mothers told me have you ever seen truthtrance he shook his head no the drugs dangerous she said but it gives insight when a truthsayers gifted by the drug she can look many places in her memory in her bodys memory we look down so many avenues of the past but only feminine avenues her voice took on a note of sadness yet theres a place where no truthsayer can see we are repelled by it terrorized it is said a man will come one day and find in the gift of the drug his inward eye he will look where we can not into both feminine and masculine pasts your kwisatz haderach yes the one who can be many places at once the kwisatz haderach many men have tried the drug so many but none has succeeded they tried and failed all of them oh no she shook her head they tried and died to attempt an understanding of muaddib without understanding his mortal enemies the harkonnens is to attempt seeing truth without knowing falsehood it is the attempt to see the light without knowing darkness it can not be from manual of muaddib by the princess irulan it was a relief globe of a world partly in shadows spinning under the impetus of a fat hand that glittered with rings the globe sat on a freeform stand at one wall of a windowless room whose other walls presented a patchwork of multicolored scrolls filmbooks tapes and reels light glowed in the room from golden balls hanging in mobile suspensor fields an ellipsoid desk with a top of jadepink petrified elacca wood stood at the center of the room veriform suspensor chairs ringed it two of them occupied in one sat a darkhaired youth of about sixteen years round of face and with sullen eyes the other held a slender short man with effeminate face both youth and man stared at the globe and the man halfhidden in shadows spinning it a chuckle sounded beside the globe a basso voice rumbled out of the chuckle there it is piter the biggest mantrap in all history and the dukes headed into its jaws is it not a magnificent thing that i the baron vladimir harkonnen do assuredly baron said the man his voice came out tenor with a sweet musical quality the fat hand descended onto the globe stopped the spinning now all eyes in the room could focus on the motionless surface and see that it was the kind of globe made for wealthy collectors or planetary governors of the empire it had the stamp of imperial handicraft about it latitude and longitude lines were laid in with hairfine platinum wire the polar caps were insets of finest cloudmilk diamonds the fat hand moved tracing details on the surface i invite you to observe the basso voice rumbled observe closely piter and you too feydrautha my darling from sixty degrees north to seventy degrees south these exquisite ripples their coloring does it not remind you of sweet caramels and nowhere do you see blue of lakes or rivers or seas and these lovely polar caps so small could anyone mistake this place arrakis truly unique a superb setting for a unique victory a smile touched piters lips and to think baron the padishah emperor believes hes given the duke your spice planet how poignant thats a nonsensical statement the baron rumbled you say this to confuse young feydrautha but it is not necessary to confuse my nephew the sullenfaced youth stirred in his chair smoothed a wrinkle in the black leotards he wore he sat upright as a discreet tapping sounded at the door in the wall behind him piter unfolded from his chair crossed to the door cracked it wide enough to accept a message cylinder he closed the door unrolled the cylinder and scanned it a chuckle sounded from him another well the baron demanded the fool answered us baron whenever did an atreides refuse the opportunity for a gesture the baron asked well what does he say hes most uncouth baron addresses you as harkonnen no sire et cher cousin no title nothing its a good name the baron growled and his voice betrayed his impatience what does dear leto say he says your offer of a meeting is refused i have ofttimes met your treachery and this all men know and the baron asked he says the art of kanly still has admirers in the empire he signs it duke leto of arrakis piter began to laugh of arrakis oh my this is almost too rich be silent piter the baron said and the laughter stopped as though shut off with a switch kanly is it the baron asked vendetta heh and he uses the nice old word so rich in tradition to be sure i know he means it you made the peace gesture piter said the forms have been obeyed for a mentat you talk too much piter the baron said and he thought i must do away with that one soon he has almost outlived his usefulness the baron stared across the room at his mental assassin seeing the feature about him that most people noticed first the eyes the shaded slits of blue within blue the eyes without any white in them at all a grin flashed across piters face it was like a mask grimace beneath those eyes like holes but baron never has revenge been more beautiful it is to see a plan of the most exquisite treachery to make leto exchange caladan for dune and without alternative because the emperor orders it how waggish of you in a cold voice the baron said you have a flux of the mouth piter but i am happy my baron whereas you you are touched by jealousy piter ahah baron is it not regrettable you were unable to devise this delicious scheme by yourself someday i will have you strangled piter of a certainty baron enfin but a kind act is never lost eh have you been chewing verite or semuta piter truth without fear surprises the baron piter said his face drew down into a caricature of a frowning mask ah hah but you see baron i know as a mentat when you will send the executioner you will hold back just so long as i am useful to move sooner would be wasteful and im yet of much use i know what it is you learned from that lovely dune planet waste not true baron the baron continued to stare at piter feydrautha squirmed in his chair these wrangling fools he thought my uncle can not talk to his mental without arguing do they think ive nothing to do except listen their arguments feyd the baron said i told you to listen and learn when i invited you in here are you learning yes uncle the voice was carefully subservient sometimes i wonder about piter the baron said i cause pain out of necessity but he i swear he takes a positive delight in it for myself i can feel pity toward the poor duke leto dr yueh will move against him soon and thatll be the end of all the atreides but surely leto will know whose hand directed the pliant doctor and knowing that will be a terrible thing then why havent you directed the doctor to slip a kindjal between his ribs quietly and efficiently piter asked you talk of pity but the duke must know when i encompass his doom the baron said and the other great houses must learn of it the knowledge will give them pause ill gain a bit more room to maneuver the necessity is obvious but i dont have to like it room to maneuver piter sneered already you have the emperors eyes on you baron you move too boldly one day the emperor will send a legion or two of his sardaukar down here onto giedi prime and thatll be an end to the baron vladimir harkonnen youd like to see that wouldnt you piter the baron asked youd enjoy seeing the corps of sardaukar pillage through my cities and sack this castle youd truly enjoy that does the baron need to ask piter whispered you shouldve been a bashar of the corps the baron said youre too interested in blood and pain perhaps i was too quick with my promise of the spoils of arrakis piter took five curiously mincing steps into the room stopped directly behind feydrautha there was a tight air of tension in the room and the youth looked up at piter with a worried frown do not toy with piter baron piter said you promised me the lady jessica you promised her to me for what piter the baron asked for pain piter stared at him dragging out the silence feydrautha moved his suspensor chair to one side said uncle do i have to stay you said youd my darling feydrautha grows impatient the baron said he moved within the shadows beside the globe patience feyd and he turned his attention back to the mentat what of the dukeling the child paul my dear piter the trap will bring him to you baron piter muttered thats not my question the baron said youll recall that you predicted the bene gesserit witch would bear a daughter to the duke you were wrong eh mentat im not often wrong baron piter said and for the first time there was fear in his voice give me that im not often wrong and you know yourself these bene gesserit bear mostly daughters even the emperors consort had produced only females uncle said feydrautha you said thered be something important here for me to listen to my nephew the baron said he aspires to rule my barony yet he can not rule himself the baron stirred beside the globe a shadow among shadows well then feydrautha harkonnen i summoned you here hoping to teach you a bit of wisdom have you observed our good mentat you shouldve learned something from this exchange but uncle a most efficient mentat piter wouldnt you say feyd yes but ah indeed but but he consumes too much spice eats it like candy look at his eyes he mightve come directly from the arrakeen labor pool efficient piter but hes still emotional and prone to passionate outbursts efficient piter but he still can err piter spoke in a low sullen tone did you call me in here to impair my efficiency with criticism baron impair your efficiency you know me better piter i wish only for my nephew to understand the limitations of a mentat are you already training my replacement piter demanded replace you why piter where could i find another mentat with your cunning and venom the same place you found me baron perhaps i should at that the baron mused you do seem a bit unstable lately and the spice you eat are my pleasures too expensive baron do you object to them my dear piter your pleasures are what tie you to me how could i object to that i merely wish my nephew to observe this about you then im on display piter said shall i dance shall i perform my various functions for the eminent feydrau precisely the baron said you are on display now be silent he glanced at feydrautha noting his nephews lips the full and pouting look of them the harkonnen genetic marker now twisted slightly in amusement this is a mentat feyd it has been trained and conditioned to perform certain duties the fact that its encased in a human body however must not be overlooked a serious drawback that i sometimes think the ancients with their thinking machines had the right idea they were toys compared to me piter snarled you yourself baron could outperform those machines perhaps the baron said ah well he took a deep breath belched now piter outline for my nephew the salient features of our campaign against the house of atreides function as a mentat for us if you please baron ive warned you not to trust one so young with this information my observations of ill be the judge of this the baron said i give you an order mentat perform one of your various functions so be it piter said he straightened assuming an odd attitude of dignity as though it were another mask but this time clothing his entire body in a few days standard the entire household of the duke leto will embark on a spacing guild liner for arrakis the guild will deposit them at the city of arrakeen rather than at our city of carthag the dukes mentat thufir hawat will have concluded rightly that arrakeen is easier to defend listen carefully feyd the baron said observe the plans within plans within plans feydrautha nodded thinking this is more like it the old monster is letting me in on secret things at last he must really mean for me to be his heir there are several tangential possibilities piter said i indicate that house atreides will go to arrakis we must not however ignore the possibility the duke has contracted with the guild to remove him to a place of safety outside the system others in like circumstances have become renegade houses taking family atomics and shields and fleeing beyond the imperium the dukes too proud a man for that the baron said it is a possibility piter said the ultimate effect for us would be the same however no it would not the baron growled i must have him dead and his line ended thats the high probability piter said there are certain preparations that indicate when a house is going renegade the duke appears to be doing none of these things so the baron sighed get on with it piter at arrakeen piter said the duke and his family will occupy the residency lately the home of count and lady fenring the ambassador to the smugglers the baron chuckled ambassador to what feydrautha asked your uncle makes a joke piter said he calls count fenring ambassador to the smugglers indicating the emperors interest in smuggling operations on arrakis feydrautha turned a puzzled stare on his uncle why dont be dense feyd the baron snapped as long as the guild remains effectively outside imperial control how could it be otherwise how else could spies and assassins move about feydrauthas mouth made a soundless ohhhh weve arranged diversions at the residency piter said therell be an attempt on the life of the atreides heir an attempt which could succeed piter the baron rumbled you indicated i indicated accidents can happen piter said and the attempt must appear valid ah but the lad has such a sweet young body the baron said of course hes potentially more dangerous than the father with that witch mother training him accursed woman ah well please continue piter hawat will have divined that we have an agent planted on him piter said the obvious suspect is dr yueh who is indeed our agent but hawat has investigated and found that our doctor is a suk school graduate with imperial conditioning supposedly safe enough to minister even to the emperor great store is set on imperial conditioning its assumed that ultimate conditioning can not be removed without killing the subject however as someone once observed given the right lever you can move a planet we found the lever that moved the doctor how feydrautha asked he found this a fascinating subject everyone knew you couldnt subvert imperial conditioning another time the baron said continue piter in place of yueh piter said well drag a most interesting suspect across hawats path the very audacity of this suspect will recommend her to hawats attention her feydrautha asked the lady jessica herself the baron said is it not sublime piter asked hawats mind will be so filled with this prospect itll impair his function as a mentat he may even try to kill her piter frowned then but i dont think hell be able to carry it off you dont want him to eh the baron asked dont distract me piter said while hawats occupied with the lady jessica well divert him further with uprisings in a few garrison towns and the like these will be put down the duke must believe hes gaining a measure of security then when the moment is ripe well signal yueh and move in with our major force ah go ahead tell him all of it the baron said well move in strengthened by two legions of sardaukar disguised in harkonnen livery sardaukar feydrautha breathed his mind focused on the dread imperial troops the killers without mercy the soldier fanatics of the padishah emperor you see how i trust you feyd the baron said no hint of this must ever reach another great house else the landsraad might unite against the imperial house and thered be chaos the main point piter said is this since house harkonnen is being used to do the imperial dirty work weve gained a true advantage its a dangerous advantage to be sure but if used cautiously will bring house harkonnen greater wealth than that of any other house in the imperium you have no idea how much wealth is involved feyd the baron said not in your wildest imaginings to begin well have an irrevocable directorship in the choam company feydrautha nodded wealth was the thing choam was the key to wealth each noble house dipping from the companys coffers whatever it could under the power of the directorships those choam directorships they were the real evidence of political power in the imperium passing with the shifts of voting strength within the landsraad as it balanced itself against the emperor and his supporters the duke leto piter said may attempt to flee to the new fremen scum along the deserts edge or he may try to send his family into that imagined security but that path is blocked by one of his majestys agents the planetary ecologist you may remember him kynes feyd remembers him the baron said get on with it you do not drool very prettily baron piter said get on with it i command you the baron roared piter shrugged if matters go as planned he said house harkonnen will have a subfief on arrakis within a standard year your uncle will have dispensation of that fief his own personal agent will rule on arrakis more profits feydrautha said indeed the baron said and he thought its only just were the ones who tamed arrakis except for the few mongrel fremen hiding in the skirts of the desert and some tame smugglers bound to the planet almost as tightly as the native labor pool and the great houses will know that the baron has destroyed the atreides piter said they will know they will know the baron breathed loveliest of all piter said is that the duke will know too he knows now he can already feel the trap its true the duke knows the baron said and his voice held a note of sadness he could not help but know mores the pity the baron moved out and away from the globe of arrakis as he emerged from the shadows his figure took on dimension grossly and immensely fat and with subtle bulges beneath folds of his dark robes to reveal that all this fat was sustained partly by portable suspensors harnessed to his flesh he might weigh two hundred standard kilos in actuality but his feet would carry no more than fifty of them i am hungry the baron rumbled and he rubbed his protruding lips with a beringed hand stared down at feydrautha through fatenfolded eyes send for food my darling we will eat before we retire thus spoke st aliaoftheknife the reverend mother must combine the seductive wiles of a courtesan with the untouchable majesty of a virgin goddess holding these attributes in tension so long as the powers of her youth endure for when youth and beauty have gone she will find that the placebetween once occupied by tension has become a wellspring of cunning and resourcefulness from muaddib family commentaries by the princess irulan well jessica what have you to say for yourself asked the reverend mother it was near sunset at castle caladan on the day of pauls ordeal the two women were alone in jessicas morning room while paul waited in the adjoining soundproofed meditation chamber jessica stood facing the south windows she saw and yet did not see the evenings banked colors across meadow and river she heard and yet did not hear the reverend mothers question there had been another ordeal once so many years ago a skinny girl with hair the color of bronze her body tortured by the winds of puberty had entered the study of the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam proctor superior of the bene gesserit school on wallach ix jessica looked down at her right hand flexed the fingers remembering the pain the terror the anger poor paul she whispered i asked you a question jessica the old womans voice was snappish demanding what oh jessica tore her attention away from the past faced the reverend mother who sat with back to the stone wall between the two west windows what do you want me to say what do i want you to say what do i want you to say the old voice carried a tone of cruel mimicry so i had a son jessica flared and she knew she was being goaded into this anger deliberately you were told to bear only daughters to the atreides it meant so much to him jessica pleaded and you in your pride thought you could produce the kwisatz haderach jessica lifted her chin i sensed the possibility you thought only of your dukes desire for a son the old woman snapped and his desires dont figure in this an atreides daughter couldve been wed to a harkonnen heir and sealed the breach youve hopelessly complicated matters we may lose both bloodlines now youre not infallible jessica said she braved the steady stare from the old eyes presently the old woman muttered whats done is done i vowed never to regret my decision jessica said how noble the reverend mother sneered no regrets we shall see when youre a fugitive with a price on your head and every mans hand turned against you to seek your life and the life of your son jessica paled is there no alternative alternative a bene gesserit should ask that i ask only what you see in the future with your superior abilities i see in the future what ive seen in the past you well know the pattern of our affairs jessica the race knows its own mortality and fears stagnation of its heredity its in the bloodstream the urge to mingle genetic strains without plan the imperium the choam company all the great houses they are but bits of flotsam in the path of the flood choam jessica muttered i suppose its already decided how theyll redivide the spoils of arrakis what is choam but the weather vane of our times the old woman said the emperor and his friends now command fiftynine point sixfive per cent of the choam directorships votes certainly they smell profits and likely as others smell those same profits his voting strength will increase this is the pattern of history girl thats certainly what i need right now jessica said a review of history dont be facetious girl you know as well as i do what forces surround us weve a threepoint civilization the imperial household balanced against the federated great houses of the landsraad and between them the guild with its damnable monopoly on interstellar transport in politics the tripod is the most unstable of all structures itd be bad enough without the complication of a feudal trade culture which turns its back on most science jessica spoke bitterly chips in the path of the flood and this chip here this is the duke leto and this ones his son and this ones oh shut up girl you entered this with full knowledge of the delicate edge you walked i am bene gesserit i exist only to serve jessica quoted truth the old woman said and all we can hope for now is to prevent this from erupting into general conflagration to salvage what we can of the key bloodlines jessica closed her eyes feeling tears press out beneath the lids she fought down the inner trembling the outer trembling the uneven breathing the ragged pulse the sweating of the palms presently she said ill pay for my own mistake and your son will pay with you ill shield him as well as im able shield the old woman snapped you well know the weakness there shield your son too much jessica and hell not grow strong enough to fulfill any destiny jessica turned away looked out the window at the gathering darkness is it really that terrible this planet of arrakis bad enough but not all bad the missionaria protectiva has been in there and softened it up somewhat the reverend mother heaved herself to her feet straightened a fold in her gown call the boy in here i must be leaving soon must you the old womans voice softened jessica girl i wish i could stand in your place and take your sufferings but each of us must make her own path i know youre as dear to me as any of my own daughters but i can not let that interfere with duty i understand the necessity what you did jessica and why you did it we both know but kindness forces me to tell you theres little chance your lad will be the bene gesserit totality you mustnt let yourself hope too much jessica shook tears from the corners of her eyes it was an angry gesture you make me feel like a little girl again reciting my first lesson she forced the words out humans must never submit to animals a dry sob shook her in a low voice she said ive been so lonely it should be one of the tests the old woman said humans are almost always lonely now summon the boy hes had a long frightening day but hes had time to think and remember and i must ask the other questions about these dreams of his jessica nodded went to the door of the meditation chamber opened it paul come in now please paul emerged with a stubborn slowness he stared at his mother as though she were a stranger wariness veiled his eyes when he glanced at the reverend mother but this time he nodded to her the nod one gives an equal he heard his mother close the door behind him young man the old woman said lets return to this dream business what do you want do you dream every night not dreams worth remembering i can remember every dream but some are worth remembering and some arent how do you know the difference i just know it the old woman glanced at jessica back to paul what did you dream last night was it worth remembering yes paul closed his eyes i dreamed a cavern and water and a girl there very skinny with big eyes her eyes are all blue no whites in them i talk to her and tell her about you about seeing the reverend mother on caladan paul opened his eyes and the thing you tell this strange girl about seeing me did it happen today paul thought about this then yes i tell the girl you came and put a stamp of strangeness on me stamp of strangeness the old woman breathed and again she shot a glance at jessica returned her attention to paul tell me truly now paul do you often have dreams of things that happen afterward exactly as you dreamed them yes and ive dreamed about that girl before oh you know her i will know her tell me about her again paul closed his eyes were in a little place in some rocks where its sheltered its almost night but its hot and i can see patches of sand out of an opening in the rocks were waiting for something for me to go meet some people and shes frightened but trying to hide it from me and im excited and she says tell me about the waters of your homeworld usul paul opened his eyes isnt that strange my homeworlds caladan ive never even heard of a planet called usul is there more to this dream jessica prompted yes but maybe she was calling me usul paul said i just thought of that again he closed his eyes she asks me to tell her about the waters and i take her hand and i say ill tell her a poem and i tell her the poem but i have to explain some of the words like beach and surf and seaweed and seagulls what poem the reverend mother asked paul opened his eyes its just one of gurney hallecks tone poems for sad times behind paul jessica began to recite i remember salt smoke from a beach fire and shadows under the pines solid clean fixed seagulls perched at the tip of land white upon green and a wind comes through the pines to sway the shadows the seagulls spread their wings lift and fill the sky with screeches and i hear the wind blowing across our beach and the surf and i see that our fire has scorched the seaweed thats the one paul said the old woman stared at paul then young man as a proctor of the bene gesserit i seek the kwisatz haderach the male who truly can become one of us your mother sees this possibility in you but she sees with the eyes of a mother possibility i see too but no more she fell silent and paul saw that she wanted him to speak he waited her out presently she said as you will then youve depths in you that ill grant may i go now he asked dont you want to hear what the reverend mother can tell you about the kwisatz haderach jessica asked she said those who tried for it died but i can help you with a few hints at why they failed the reverend mother said she talks of hints paul thought she doesnt really know anything and he said hint then and be damned to me she smiled wryly a crisscross of wrinkles in the old face very well that which submits rules he felt astonishment she was talking about such elementary things as tension within meaning did she think his mother had taught him nothing at all thats a hint he asked were not here to bandy words or quibble over their meaning the old woman said the willow submits to the wind and prospers until one day it is many willows a wall against the wind this is the willows purpose paul stared at her she said purpose and he felt the word buffet him reinfecting him with terrible purpose he experienced a sudden anger at her fatuous old witch with her mouth full of platitudes you think i could be this kwisatz haderach he said you talk about me but you havent said one thing about what we can do to help my father ive heard you talking to my mother you talk as though my father were dead well he isnt if there were a thing to be done for him wed have done it the old woman growled we may be able to salvage you doubtful but possible but for your father nothing when youve learned to accept that as a fact youve learned a real bene gesserit lesson paul saw how the words shook his mother he glared at the old woman how could she say such a thing about his father what made her so sure his mind seethed with resentment the reverend mother looked at jessica youve been training him in the way ive seen the signs of it id have done the same in your shoes and devil take the rules jessica nodded now i caution you said the old woman to ignore the regular order of training his own safety requires the voice he already has a good start in it but we both know how much more he needs and that desperately she stepped close to paul stared down at him goodbye young human i hope you make it but if you dont well we shall yet succeed once more she looked at jessica a flicker sign of understanding passed between them then the old woman swept from the room her robes hissing with not another backward glance the room and its occupants already were shut from her thoughts but jessica had caught one glimpse of the reverend mothers face as she turned away there had been tears on the seamed cheeks the tears were more unnerving than any other word or sign that had passed between them this day you have read that muaddib had no playmates his own age on caladan the dangers were too great but muaddib did have wonderful companionteachers there was gurney halleck the troubadourwarrior you will sing some of gurneys songs as you read along in this book there was thufir hawat the old mentat master of assassins who struck fear even into the heart of the padishah emperor there were duncan idaho the swordmaster of the ginaz dr wellington yueh a name black in treachery but bright in knowledge the lady jessica who guided her son in the bene gesserit way and of course the duke leto whose qualities as a father have long been overlooked from a childs history of muaddib by the princess irulan thufir hawat slipped into the training room of castle caladan closed the door softly he stood there a moment feeling old and tired and stormleathered his left leg ached where it had been slashed once in the service of the old duke three generations of them now he thought he stared across the big room bright with the light of noon pouring through the skylights saw the boy seated with back to the door intent on papers and charts spread across an ell table how many times must i tell that lad never to settle himself with his back to a door hawat cleared his throat paul remained bent over his studies a cloud shadow passed over the skylights again hawat cleared his throat paul straightened spoke without turning i know im sitting with my back to a door hawat suppressed a smile strode across the room paul looked up at the grizzled old man who stopped at a corner of the table hawats eyes were two pools of alertness in a dark and deeply seamed face i heard you coming down the hall paul said and i heard you open the door the sounds i make could be imitated id know the difference he might at that hawat thought that witchmother of his is giving him the deep training certainly i wonder what her precious school thinks of that maybe thats why they sent the old proctor here to whip our dear lady jessica into line hawat pulled up a chair across from paul sat down facing the door he did it pointedly leaned back and studied the room it struck him as an odd place suddenly a strangerplace with most of its hardware already gone off to arrakis a training table remained and a fencing mirror with its crystal prisms quiescent the target dummy beside it patched and padded looking like an ancient foot soldier maimed and battered in the wars there stand i hawat thought thufir whatre you thinking paul asked hawat looked at the boy i was thinking well all be out of here soon and likely never see the place again does that make you sad sad nonsense parting with friends is a sadness a place is only a place he glanced at the charts on the table and arrakis is just another place did my father send you up to test me hawat scowled the boy had such observing ways about him he nodded youre thinking itd have been nicer if hed come up himself but you must know how busy he is hell be along later ive been studying about the storms on arrakis the storms i see they sound pretty bad thats too cautious a word bad those storms build up across six or seven thousand kilometers of flatlands feed on anything that can give them a push coriolis force other storms anything that has an ounce of energy in it they can blow up to seven hundred kilometers an hour loaded with everything loose thats in their way sand dust everything they can eat flesh off bones and etch the bones to slivers why dont they have weather control arrakis has special problems costs are higher and thered be maintenance and the like the guild wants a dreadful high price for satellite control and your fathers house isnt one of the big rich ones lad you know that have you ever seen the fremen the lads mind is darting all over today hawat thought like as not i have seen them he said theres little to tell them from the folk of the graben and sink they all wear those great flowing robes and they stink to heaven in any closed space its from those suits they wear call them stillsuits that reclaim the bodys own water paul swallowed suddenly aware of the moisture in his mouth remembering a dream of thirst that people could want so for water they had to recycle their body moisture struck him with a feeling of desolation waters precious there he said hawat nodded thinking perhaps im doing it getting across to him the importance of this planet as an enemy its madness to go in there without that caution in our minds paul looked up at the skylight aware that it had begun to rain he saw the spreading wetness on the gray metaglass water he said youll learn a great concern for water hawat said as the dukes son youll never want for it but youll see the pressures of thirst all around you paul wet his lips with his tongue thinking back to the day a week ago and the ordeal with the reverend mother she too had said something about water starvation youll learn about the funeral plains shed said about the wilderness that is empty the wasteland where nothing lives except the spice and the sandworms youll stain your eyepits to reduce the sun glare shelter will mean a hollow out of the wind and hidden from view youll ride upon your own two feet without thopter or groundcar or mount and paul had been caught more by her tone singsong and wavering than by her words when you live upon arrakis she had said khala the land is empty the moons will be your friends the sun your enemy paul had sensed his mother come up beside him away from her post guarding the door she had looked at the reverend mother and asked do you see no hope your reverence not for the father and the old woman had waved jessica to silence looked down at paul grave this on your memory lad a world is supported by four things she held up four bigknuckled fingers the learning of the wise the justice of the great the prayers of the righteous and the valor of the brave but all of these are as nothing she closed her fingers into a fist without a ruler who knows the art of ruling make that the science of your tradition a week had passed since that day with the reverend mother her words were only now beginning to come into full register now sitting in the training room with thufir hawat paul felt a sharp pang of fear he looked across at the mentats puzzled frown where were you woolgathering that time hawat asked did you meet the reverend mother that truthsayer witch from the imperium hawats eyes quickened with interest i met her she paul hesitated found that he couldnt tell hawat about the ordeal the inhibitions went deep yes what did she paul took two deep breaths she said a thing he closed his eyes calling up the words and when he spoke his voice unconsciously took on some of the old womans tone you paul atreides descendant of kings son of a duke you must learn to rule its something none of your ancestors learned paul opened his eyes said that made me angry and i said my father rules an entire planet and she said hes losing it and i said my father was getting a richer planet and she said hell lose that one too and i wanted to run and warn my father but she said hed already been warned by you by mother by many people true enough hawat muttered then whyre we going paul demanded because the emperor ordered it and because theres hope in spite of what that witchspy said what else spouted from this ancient fountain of wisdom paul looked down at his right hand clenched into a fist beneath the table slowly he willed the muscles to relax she put some kind of hold on me he thought how she asked me to tell her what it is to rule paul said and i said that one commands and she said i had some unlearning to do she hit a mark there right enough hawat thought he nodded for paul to continue she said a ruler must learn to persuade and not to compel she said he must lay the best coffee hearth to attract the finest men howd she figure your father attracted men like duncan and gurney hawat asked paul shrugged then she said a good ruler has to learn his worlds language that its different for every world and i thought she meant they didnt speak galach on arrakis but she said that wasnt it at all she said she meant the language of the rocks and growing things the language you dont hear just with your ears and i said thats what dr yueh calls the mystery of life hawat chuckled howd that sit with her i think she got mad she said the mystery of life isnt a problem to solve but a reality to experience so i quoted the first law of mentat at her a process can not be understood by stopping it understanding must move with the flow of the process must join it and flow with it that seemed to satisfy her he seems to be getting over it hawat thought but that old witch frightened him why did she do it thufir paul said will arrakis be as bad as she said nothing could be that bad hawat said and forced a smile take those fremen for example the renegade people of the desert by firstapproximation analysis i can tell you therere many many more of them than the imperium suspects people live there lad a great many people and hawat put a sinewy finger beside his eye they hate harkonnens with a bloody passion you must not breathe a word of this lad i tell you only as your fathers helper my father has told me of salusa secundus paul said do you know thufir it sounds much like arrakis perhaps not quite as bad but much like it we do not really know of salusa secundus today hawat said only what it was like long ago mostly but what is known youre right on that score will the fremen help us its a possibility hawat stood up i leave today for arrakis meanwhile you take care of yourself for an old man whos fond of you heh come around here like the good lad and sit facing the door its not that i think theres any danger in the castle its just a habit i want you to form paul got to his feet moved around the table youre going today today it is and youll be following tomorrow next time we meet itll be on the soil of your new world he gripped pauls right arm at the bicep keep your knife arm free heh and your shield at full charge he released the arm patted pauls shoulder whirled and strode quickly to the door thufir paul called hawat turned standing in the open doorway dont sit with your back to any doors paul said a grin spread across the seamed old face that i wont lad depend on it and he was gone shutting the door softly behind paul sat down where hawat had been straightened the papers one more day here he thought he looked around the room we re leaving the idea of departure was suddenly more real to him than it had ever been before he recalled another thing the old woman had said about a world being the sum of many things the people the dirt the growing things the moons the tides the suns the unknown sum called nature a vague summation without any sense of the now and he wondered what is the now the door across from paul banged open and an ugly lump of a man lurched through it preceded by a handful of weapons well gurney halleck paul called are you the new weapons master halleck kicked the door shut with one heel youd rather i came to play games i know he said he glanced abound the room noting that hawats men already had been over it checking making it safe for a dukes heir the subtle code signs were all around paul watched the rolling ugly man set himself back in motion veer toward the training table with the load of weapons saw the ninestring baliset slung over gurneys shoulder with the multipick woven through the strings near the head of the fingerboard halleck dropped the weapons on the exercise table lined them up the rapiers the bodkins the kindjals the slowpellet stunners the shield belts the inkvine scar along his jawline writhed as he turned casting a smile across the room so you dont even have a good morning for me you young imp halleck said and what barb did you sink in old hawat he passed me in the hall like a man running to his enemys funeral paul grinned of all his fathers men he liked gurney halleck best knew the mans moods and deviltry his humors and thought of him more as a friend than as a hired sword halleck swung the baliset off his shoulder began tuning it if y wont talk y wont he said paul stood advanced across the room calling out well gurney do we come prepared for music when its fighting time so its sass for our elders today halleck said he tried a chord on the instrument nodded wheres duncan idaho paul asked isnt he supposed to be teaching me weaponry duncans gone to lead the second wave onto arrakis halleck said all you have left is poor gurney whos fresh out of fight and spoiling for music he struck another chord listened to it smiled and it was decided in council that you being such a poor fighter wed best teach you the music trade sos you wont waste your life entire maybe youd better sing me a lay then paul said i want to be sure how not to do it ahhh hah gurney laughed and he swung into galacian girls his multipick a blur over the strings as he sang ohhh the galacian girls will do it for pearls and the arrakeen for water but if you desire dames like consuming flames try a caladanin daughter not bad for such a poor hand with the pick paul said but if my mother heard you singing a bawdy like that in the castle shed have your ears on the outer wall for decoration gurney pulled at his left ear poor decoration too they having been bruised so much listening at keyholes while a young lad i know practiced some strange ditties on his baliset so youve forgotten what its like to find sand in your bed paul said he pulled a shield belt from the table buckled it fast around his waist then lets fight hallecks eyes went wide in mock surprise so it was your wicked hand did that deed guard yourself today young master guard yourself he grabbed up a rapier laced the air with it im a hellfiend out for revenge paul lifted the companion rapier bent it in his hands stood in the aguile one foot forward he let his manner go solemn in a comic imitation of dr yueh what a dolt my father sends me for weaponry paul intoned this doltish gurney halleck has forgotten the first lesson for a fighting man armed and shielded paul snapped the force button at his waist felt the crinkledskin tingling of the defensive field at his forehead and down his back heard external sounds take on characteristic shieldfiltered flatness in shield fighting one moves fast on defense slow on attack paul said attack has the sole purpose of tricking the opponent into a misstep setting him up for the attack sinister the shield turns the fast blow admits the slow kindjal paul snapped up the rapier feinted fast and whipped it back for a slow thrust timed to enter a shields mindless defenses halleck watched the action turned at the last minute to let the blunted blade pass his chest speed excellent he said but you were wide open for an underhanded counter with a sliptip paul stepped back chagrined i should whap your backside for such carelessness halleck said he lifted a naked kindjal from the table and held it up this in the hand of an enemy can let out your lifes blood youre an apt pupil none better but ive warned you that not even in play do you let a man inside your guard with death in his hand i guess im not in the mood for it today paul said mood hallecks voice betrayed his outrage even through the shields filtering what has mood to do with it you fight when the necessity arises no matter the mood moods a thing for cattle or making love or playing the baliset its not for fighting im sorry gurney youre not sorry enough halleck activated his own shield crouched with kindjal outthrust in left hand the rapier poised high in his right now i say guard yourself for true he leaped high to one side then forward pressing a furious attack paul fell back parrying he felt the field crackling as shield edges touched and repelled each other sensed the electric tingling of the contact along his skin whats gotten into gurney he asked himself hes not faking this paul moved his left hand dropped his bodkin into his palm from its wrist sheath you see a need for an extra blade eh halleck grunted is this betrayal paul wondered surely not gurney around the room they fought thrust and parry feint and counterfeint the air within their shield bubbles grew stale from the demands on it that the slow interchange along barrier edges could not replenish with each new shield contact the smell of ozone grew stronger paul continued to back but now he directed his retreat toward the exercise table if i can turn him beside the table ill show him a trick paul thought one more step gurney halleck took the step paul directed a parry downward turned saw hallecks rapier catch against the tables edge paul flung himself aside thrust high with rapier and came in across hallecks neckline with the bodkin he stopped the blade an inch from the jugular is this what you seek paul whispered look down lad gurney panted paul obeyed saw hallecks kindjal thrust under the tables edge the tip almost touching pauls groin wed have joined each other in death halleck said but ill admit you fought some better when pressed to it you seemed to get the mood and he grinned wolfishly the inkvine scar rippling along his jaw the way you came at me paul said would you really have drawn my blood halleck withdrew the kindjal straightened if youd fought one whit beneath your abilities id have scratched you a good one a scar youd remember ill not have my favorite pupil fall to the first harkonnen tramp who happens along paul deactivated his shield leaned on the table to catch his breath i deserved that gurney but it wouldve angered my father if youd hurt me ill not have you punished for my failing as to that halleck said it was my failing too and you neednt worry about a training scar or two youre lucky you have so few as to your father the duked punish me only if i failed to make a firstclass fighting man out of you and id have been failing there if i hadnt explained the fallacy in this mood thing youve suddenly developed paul straightened slipped his bodkin back into its wrist sheath its not exactly play we do here halleck said paul nodded he felt a sense of wonder at the uncharacteristic seriousness in hallecks manner the sobering intensity he looked at the beetcolored inkvine scar on the mans jaw remembering the story of how it had been put there by beast rabban in a harkonnen slave pit on giedi prime and paul felt a sudden shame that he had doubted halleck even for an instant it occurred to paul then that the making of hallecks scar had been accompanied by pain a pain as intense perhaps as that inflicted by a reverend mother he thrust this thought aside it chilled their world i guess i did hope for some play today paul said things are so serious around here lately halleck turned away to hide his emotions something burned in his eyes there was pain in him like a blister all that was left of some lost yesterday that time had pruned off him how soon this child must assume his manhood halleck thought how soon he must read that form within his mind that contract of brutal caution to enter the necessary fact on the necessary line please list your next of kin halleck spoke without turning i sensed the play in you lad and id like nothing better than to join in it but this no longer can be play tomorrow we go to arrakis arrakis is real the harkonnens are real paul touched his forehead with his rapier blade held vertical halleck turned saw the salute and acknowledged it with a nod he gestured to the practice dummy now well work on your timing let me see you catch that thing sinister ill control it from over here where i can have a full view of the action and i warn you ill be trying new counters today theres a warning youd not get from a real enemy paul stretched up on his toes to relieve his muscles he felt solemn with the sudden realization that his life had become filled with swift changes he crossed to the dummy slapped the switch on its chest with his rapier tip and felt the defensive field forcing his blade away en garde halleck called and the dummy pressed the attack paul activated his shield parried and countered halleck watched as he manipulated the controls his mind seemed to be in two parts one alert to the needs of the training fight and the other wandering in flybuzz im the welltrained fruit tree he thought full of welltrained feelings and abilities and all of them grafted onto me all bearing for someone else to pick for some reason he recalled his younger sister her elfin face so clear in his mind but she was dead now in a pleasure house for harkonnen troops she had loved pansies or was it daisies he couldnt remember it bothered him that he couldnt remember paul countered a slow swing of the dummy brought up his left hand entretisser that clever little devil halleck thought intent now on pauls interweaving hand motions hes been practicing and studying on his own thats not duncans style and its certainly nothing ive taught him this thought only added to hallecks sadness im infected by mood he thought and he began to wonder about paul if the boy ever listened fearfully to his pillow throbbing in the night if wishes were fishes wed all cast nets he murmured it was his mothers expression and he always used it when he felt the blackness of tomorrow on him then he thought what an odd expression that was to be taking to a planet that had never known seas or fishes yueh yue wellington welingtun stdrd medical doctor of the suk school grd stdrd md wan na marcus bg stdrd chiefly noted as betrayer of duke leto atreides cf bibliography appendix vii imperial conditioning and betrayal the from dictionary of muaddib by the princess irulan although he heard dr yueh enter the training room noting the stiff deliberation of the mans pace paul remained stretched out face down on the exercise table where the masseuse had left him he felt deliciously relaxed after the workout with gurney halleck you do look comfortable said yueh in his calm highpitched voice paul raised his head saw the mans stick figure standing several paces away took in at a glance the wrinkled black clothing the square block of a head with purple lips and drooping mustache the diamond tattoo of imperial conditioning on his forehead the long black hair caught in the suk schools silver ring at the left shoulder youll be happy to hear we havent time for regular lessons today yueh said your father will be along presently paul sat up however ive arranged for you to have a filmbook viewer and several lessons during the crossing to arrakis oh paul began pulling on his clothes he felt excitement that his father would be coming they had spent so little time together since the emperors command to take over the fief of arrakis yueh crossed to the ell table thinking how the boy has filled out these past few months such a waste oh such a sad waste and he reminded himself i must not falter what i do is done to be certain my wan na no longer can be hurt by the harkonnen beasts paul joined him at the table buttoning his jacket whatll i be studying on the way across ahhhh the terranic life forms of arrakis the planet seems to have opened its arms to certain terranic life forms its not clear how i must seek out the planetary ecologist when we arrive a dr kynes and offer my help in the investigation and yueh thought what am i saying i play the hypocrite even with myself will there be something on the fremen paul asked the fremen yueh drummed his fingers on the table caught paul staring at the nervous motion withdrew his hand maybe you have something on the whole arrakeen population paul said yes to be sure yueh said there are two general separations of the people fremen they are one group and the others are the people of the graben the sink and the pan theres some intermarriage im told the women of pan and sink villages prefer fremen husbands their men prefer fremen wives they have a saying polish comes from the cities wisdom from the desert do you have pictures of them ill see what i can get you the most interesting feature of course is their eyes totally blue no whites in them mutation no its linked to saturation of the blood with melange the fremen must be brave to live at the edge of that desert by all accounts yueh said they compose poems to their knives their women are as fierce as the men even fremen children are violent and dangerous youll not be permitted to mingle with them i daresay paul stared at yueh finding in these few glimpses of the fremen a power of words that caught his entire attention what a people to win as allies and the worms paul asked what id like to study more about the sandworms ahhhh to be sure ive a filmbook on a small specimen only one hundred and ten meters long and twentytwo meters in diameter it was taken in the northern latitudes worms of more than four hundred meters in length have been recorded by reliable witnesses and theres reason to believe even larger ones exist paul glanced down at a conical projection chart of the northern arrakeen latitudes spread on the table the desert belt and south polar regions are marked uninhabitable is it the worms and the storms but any place can be made habitable if its economically feasible yueh said arrakis has many costly perils he smoothed his drooping mustache your father will be here soon before i go ive a gift for you something i came across in packing he put an object on the table between them black oblong no larger than the end of pauls thumb paul looked at it yueh noted how the boy did not reach for it and thought how cautious he is its a very old orange catholic bible made for space travelers not a filmbook but actually printed on filament paper it has its own magnifier and electrostatic charge system he picked it up demonstrated the book is held closed by the charge which forces against springlocked covers you press the edge thus and the pages youve selected repel each other and the book opens its so small but it has eighteen hundred pages you press the edge thus and so and the charge moves ahead one page at a time as you read never touch the actual pages with your fingers the filament tissue is too delicate he closed the book handed it to paul try it yueh watched paul work the page adjustment thought i salve my own conscience i give him the surcease of religion before betraying him thus may i say to myself that he has gone where i can not go this mustve been made before filmbooks paul said its quite old let it be our secret eh your parents might think it too valuable for one so young and yueh thought his mother would surely wonder at my motives well paul closed the book held it in his hand if its so valuable indulge an old mans whim yueh said it was given to me when i was very young and he thought i must catch his mind as well as his cupidity open it to foursixtyseven kalima where it says from water does all life begin theres a slight notch on the edge of the cover to mark the place paul felt the cover detected two notches one shallower than the other he pressed the shallower one and the book spread open on his palm its magnifier sliding into place read it aloud yueh said paul wet his lips with his tongue read think you of the fact that a deaf person can not hear then what deafness may we not all possess what senses do we lack that we can not see and can not hear another world all around us what is there around us that we can not stop it yueh barked paul broke off stared at him yueh closed his eyes fought to regain composure what perversity caused the book to open at my wannas favorite passage he opened his eyes saw paul staring at him is something wrong paul asked im sorry yueh said that was my dead wifes favorite passage its not the one i intended you to read it brings up memories that are painful there are two notches paul said of course yueh thought wan na marked her passage his fingers are more sensitive than mine and found her mark it was an accident no more you may find the book interesting yueh said it has much historical truth in it as well as good ethical philosophy paul looked down at the tiny book in his palm such a small thing yet it contained a mystery something had happened while he read from it he had felt something stir his terrible purpose your father will be here any minute yueh said put the book away and read it at your leisure paul touched the edge of it as yueh had shown him the book sealed itself he slipped it into his tunic for a moment there when yueh had barked at him paul had feared the man would demand the books return i thank you for the gift dr yueh paul said speaking formally it will be our secret if there is a gift of favor you wish from me please do not hesitate to ask i need for nothing yueh said and he thought why do i stand here torturing myself and torturing this poor lad though he does not know it oeyh damn those harkonnen beasts why did they choose me for their abomination how do we approach the study of muaddibs father a man of surpassing warmth and surprising coldness was the duke leto atreides yet many facts open the way to this duke his abiding love for his bene gesserit lady the dreams he held for his son the devotion with which men served him you see him there a man snared by destiny a lonely figure with his light dimmed behind the glory of his son still one must ask what is the son but an extension of the father from muaddib family commentaries by the princess irulan paul watched his father enter the training room saw the guards take up stations outside one of them closed the door as always paul experienced a sense of presence in his father someone totally here the duke was tall oliveskinned his thin face held harsh angles warmed only by deep gray eyes he wore a black working uniform with red armorial hawk crest at the breast a silvered shield belt with the patina of much use girded his narrow waist the duke said hard at work son he crossed to the ell table glanced at the papers on it swept his gaze around the room and back to paul he felt tired filled with the ache of not showing his fatigue i must use every opportunity to rest during the crossing to arrakis he thought therell be no rest on arrakis not very hard paul said everythings so he shrugged yes well tomorrow we leave itll be good to get settled in our new home put all this upset behind paul nodded suddenly overcome by memory of the reverend mothers words for the father nothing father paul said will arrakis be as dangerous as everyone says the duke forced himself to the casual gesture sat down on a corner of the table smiled a whole pattern of conversation welled up in his mind the kind of thing he might use to dispel the vapors in his men before a battle the pattern froze before it could be vocalized confronted by the single thought this is my son itll be dangerous he admitted hawat tells me we have a plan for the fremen paul said and he wondered why dont i tell him what that old woman said how did she seal my tongue the duke noted his sons distress said as always hawat sees the main chance but theres much more i see also the combine honnete ober advancer mercantiles the choam company by giving me arrakis his majesty is forced to give us a choam directorship a subtle gain choam controls the spice paul said and arrakis with its spice is our avenue into choam the duke said theres more to choam than melange did the reverend mother warn you paul blurted he clenched his fists feeling his palms slippery with perspiration the effort it had taken to ask that question hawat tells me she frightened you with warnings about arrakis the duke said dont let a womans fears cloud your mind no woman wants her loved ones endangered the hand behind those warnings was your mothers take this as a sign of her love for us does she know about the fremen yes and about much more what and the duke thought the truth could be worse than he imagines but even dangerous facts are valuable if youve been trained to deal with them and theres one place where nothing has been spared for my son dealing with dangerous facts this must be leavened though he is young few products escape the choam touch the duke said logs donkeys horses cows lumber dung sharks whale fur the most prosaic and the most exotic even our poor pundi rice from caladan anything the guild will transport the art forms of ecaz the machines of richesse and ix but all fades before melange a handful of spice will buy a home on tupile it can not be manufactured it must be mined on arrakis it is unique and it has true geriatric properties and now we control it to a certain degree but the important thing is to consider all the houses that depend on choam profits and think of the enormous proportion of those profits dependent upon a single product the spice imagine what would happen if something should reduce spice production whoever had stockpiled melange could make a killing paul said others would be out in the cold the duke permitted himself a moment of grim satisfaction looking at his son and thinking how penetrating how truly educated that observation had been he nodded the harkonnens have been stockpiling for more than twenty years they mean spice production to fail and you to be blamed they wish the atreides name to become unpopular the duke said think of the landsraad houses that look to me for a certain amount of leadership their unofficial spokesman think how theyd react if i were responsible for a serious reduction in their income after all ones own profits come first the great convention be damned you cant let someone pauperize you a harsh smile twisted the dukes mouth theyd look the other way no matter what was done to me even if we were attacked with atomics nothing that flagrant no open defiance of the convention but almost anything else short of that perhaps even dusting and a bit of soil poisoning then why are we walking into this paul the duke frowned at his son knowing where the trap is thats the first step in evading it this is like single combat son only on a larger scale a feint within a feint within a feint seemingly without end the task is to unravel it knowing that the harkonnens stockpile melange we ask another question who else is stockpiling thats the list of our enemies who certain houses we knew were unfriendly and some wed thought friendly we need not consider them for the moment because there is one other much more important our beloved padishah emperor paul tried to swallow in a throat suddenly dry couldnt you convene the landsraad expose make our enemy aware we know which hand holds the knife ah now paul we see the knife now who knows where it might be shifted next if we put this before the landsraad itd only create a great cloud of confusion the emperor would deny it who could gainsay him all wed gain is a little time while risking chaos and where would the next attack come from all the houses might start stockpiling spice our enemies have a head start too much of a lead to overcome the emperor paul said that means the sardaukar disguised in harkonnen livery no doubt the duke said but the soldier fanatics nonetheless how can fremen help us against sardaukar did hawat talk to you about salusa secundus the emperors prison planet no what if it were more than a prison planet paul theres a question you never hear asked about the imperial corps of sardaukar where do they come from from the prison planet they come from somewhere but the supporting levies the emperor demands from thats what were led to believe theyre just the emperors levies trained young and superbly you hear an occasional muttering about the emperors training cadres but the balance of our civilization remains the same the military forces of the landsraad great houses on one side the sardaukar and their supporting levies on the other and their supporting levies paul the sardaukar remain the sardaukar but every report on salusa secundus says ss is a hell world undoubtedly but if you were going to raise tough strong ferocious men what environmental conditions would you impose on them how could you win the loyalty of such men there are proven ways play on the certain knowledge of their superiority the mystique of secret covenant the esprit of shared suffering it can be done it has been done on many worlds in many times paul nodded holding his attention on his fathers face he felt some revelation impending consider arrakis the duke said when you get outside the towns and garrison villages its every bit as terrible a place as salusa secundus pauls eyes went wide the fremen we have there the potential of a corps as strong and deadly as the sardaukar itll require patience to exploit them secretly and wealth to equip them properly but the fremen are there and the spice wealth is there you see now why we walk into arrakis knowing the trap is there dont the harkonnens know about the fremen the harkonnens sneered at the fremen hunted them for sport never even bothered trying to count them we know the harkonnen policy with planetary populations spend as little as possible to maintain them the metallic threads in the hawk symbol above his fathers breast glistened as the duke shifted his position you see were negotiating with the fremen right now paul said i sent a mission headed by duncan idaho the duke said a proud and ruthless man duncan but fond of the truth i think the fremen will admire him if were lucky they may judge us by him duncan the moral duncan the moral paul said and gurney the valorous you name them well the duke said and paul thought gurneys one of those the reverend mother meant a supporter of worlds the valor of the brave gurney tells me you did well in weapons today the duke said that isnt what he told me the duke laughed aloud i figured gurney to be sparse with his praise he says you have a nicety of awareness in his own words of the difference between a blades edge and its tip gurney says theres no artistry in killing with the tip that it should be done with the edge gurneys a romantic the duke growled this talk of killing suddenly disturbed him coming from his son id sooner you never had to kill but if the need arises you do it however you can tip or edge he looked up at the skylight on which the rain was drumming seeing the direction of his fathers stare paul thought of the wet skies out there a thing never to be seen on arrakis from all accounts and this thought of skies put him in mind of the space beyond are the guild ships really big he asked the duke looked at him this will be your first time off planet he said yes theyre big well be riding a heighliner because its a long trip a heighliner is truly big its hold will tuck all our frigates and transports into a little corner well be just a small part of the ships manifest and we wont be able to leave our frigates thats part of the price you pay for guild security there could be harkonnen ships right alongside us and wed have nothing to fear from them the harkonnens know better than to endanger their shipping privileges im going to watch our screens and try to see a guildsman you wont not even their agents ever see a guildsman the guilds as jealous of its privacy as it is of its monopoly dont do anything to endanger our shipping privileges paul do you think they hide because theyve mutated and dont look human anymore who knows the duke shrugged its a mystery were not likely to solve weve more immediate problems among them you me your mother wanted me to be the one to tell you son you see you may have mentat capabilities paul stared at his father unable to speak for a moment then a mentat me but i hawat agrees son its true but i thought mentat training had to start during infancy and the subject couldnt be told because it might inhibit the early he broke off all his past circumstances coming to focus in one flashing computation i see he said a day comes the duke said when the potential mentat must learn whats being done it may no longer be done to him the mentat has to share in the choice of whether to continue or abandon the training some can continue some are incapable of it only the potential mentat can tell this for sure about himself paul rubbed his chin all the special training from hawat and his mother the mnemonics the focusing of awareness the muscle control and sharpening of sensitivities the study of languages and nuances of voices all of it clicked into a new kind of understanding in his mind youll be the duke someday son his father said a mentat duke would be formidable indeed can you decide now or do you need more time there was no hesitation in his answer ill go on with the training formidable indeed the duke murmured and paul saw the proud smile on his fathers face the smile shocked paul it had a skull look on the dukes narrow features paul closed his eyes feeling the terrible purpose reawaken within him perhaps being a mentat is terrible purpose he thought but even as he focused on this thought his new awareness denied it with the lady jessica and arrakis the bene gesserit system of sowing implantlegends through the missionaria protectiva came to its full fruition the wisdom of seeding the known universe with a prophecy pattern for the protection of bg personnel has long been appreciated but never have we seen a conditionutextremis with more ideal mating of person and preparation the prophetic legends had taken on arrakis even to the extent of adopted labels including reverend mother canto and respondu and most of the sharia panoplia propheticus and it is generally accepted now that the lady jessicas latent abilities were grossly underestimated from analysis the arrakeen crisis by the princess irulan private circulation bg file number ar all around the lady jessica piled in corners of the arrakeen great hall mounded in the open spaces stood the packaged freight of their lives boxes trunks cartons cases some partly unpacked she could hear the cargo handlers from the guild shuttle depositing another load in the entry jessica stood in the center of the hall she moved in a slow turn looking up and around at shadowed carvings crannies and deeply recessed windows this giant anachronism of a room reminded her of the sisters hall at her bene gesserit school but at the school the effect had been of warmth here all was bleak stone some architect had reached far back into history for these buttressed walls and dark hangings she thought the arched ceiling stood two stories above her with great crossbeams she felt sure had been shipped here to arrakis across space at monstrous cost no planet of this system grew trees to make such beams unless the beams were imitation wood she thought not this had been the government mansion in the days of the old empire costs had been of less importance then it had been before the harkonnens and their new megalopolis of carthag a cheap and brassy place some two hundred kilometers northeast across the broken land leto had been wise to choose this place for his seat of government the name arrakeen had a good sound filled with tradition and this was a smaller city easier to sterilize and defend again there came the clatter of boxes being unloaded in the entry jessica sighed against a carton to her right stood the painting of the dukes father wrapping twine hung from it like a frayed decoration a piece of the twine was still clutched in jessicas left hand beside the painting lay a black bulls head mounted on a polished board the head was a dark island in a sea of wadded paper its plaque lay flat on the floor and the bulls shiny muzzle pointed at the ceiling as though the beast were ready to bellow a challenge into this echoing room jessica wondered what compulsion had brought her to uncover those two things first the head and the painting she knew there was something symbolic in the action not since the day when the dukes buyers had taken her from the school had she felt this frightened and unsure of herself the head and the picture they heightened her feelings of confusion she shuddered glanced at the slit windows high overhead it was still early afternoon here and in these latitudes the sky looked black and cold so much darker than the warm blue of caladan a pang of homesickness throbbed through her so far away caladan here we are the voice was duke letos she whirled saw him striding from the arched passage to the dining hall his black working uniform with red armorial hawk crest at the breast looked dusty and rumpled i thought you might have lost yourself in this hideous place he said it is a cold house she said she looked at his tallness at the dark skin that made her think of olive groves and golden sun on blue waters there was woodsmoke in the gray of his eyes but the face was predatory thin full of sharp angles and planes a sudden fear of him tightened her breast he had become such a savage driving person since the decision to bow to the emperors command the whole city feels cold she said its a dirty dusty little garrison town he agreed but well change that he looked around the hall these are public rooms for state occasions ive just glanced at some of the family apartments in the south wing theyre much nicer he stepped closer touched her arm admiring her stateliness and again he wondered at her unknown ancestry a renegade house perhaps some blackbarred royalty she looked more regal than the emperors own blood under the pressure of his stare she turned half away exposing her profile and he realized there was no single and precise thing that brought her beauty to focus the face was oval under a cap of hair the color of polished bronze her eyes were set wide as green and clear as the morning skies of caladan the nose was small the mouth wide and generous her figure was good but scant tall and with its curves gone to slimness he remembered that the lay sisters at the school had called her skinny so his buyers had told him but that description oversimplified she had brought a regal beauty back into the atreides line he was glad that paul favored her wheres paul he asked someplace around the house taking his lessons with yueh probably in the south wing he said i thought i heard yuehs voice but i couldnt take time to look he glanced down at her hesitating i came here only to hang the key of caladan castle in the dining hall she caught her breath stopped the impulse to reach out to him hanging the key there was finality in that action but this was not the time or place for comforting i saw our banner over the house as we came in she said he glanced at the painting of his father where were you going to hang that somewhere in here no the word rang flat and final telling her she could use trickery to persuade but open argument was useless still she had to try even if the gesture served only to remind herself that she would not trick him my lord she said if youd only the answer remains no i indulge you shamefully in most things not in this ive just come from the dining hall where there are my lord please the choice is between your digestion and my ancestral dignity my dear he said they will hang in the dining hall she sighed yes my lord you may resume your custom of dining in your rooms whenever possible i shall expect you at your proper position only on formal occasions thank you my lord and dont go all cold and formal on me be thankful that i never married you my dear then itd be your duty to join me at table for every meal she held her face immobile nodded hawat already has our own poison snooper over the dining table he said theres a portable in your room you anticipated this disagreement she said my dear i think also of your comfort ive engaged servants theyre locals but hawat has cleared them theyre fremen all theyll do until our own people can be released from their other duties can anyone from this place be truly safe anyone who hates harkonnens you may even want to keep the head housekeeper the shadout mapes shadout jessica said a fremen title im told it means welldipper a meaning with rather important overtones here she may not strike you as a servant type although hawat speaks highly of her on the basis of duncans report theyre convinced she wants to serve specifically that she wants to serve you me the fremen have learned that youre bene gesserit he said there are legends here about the bene gesserit the missionaria protectiva jessica thought no place escapes them does this mean duncan was successful she asked will the fremen be our allies theres nothing definite he said they wish to observe us for a while duncan believes they did however promise to stop raiding our outlying villages during a truce period thats a more important gain than it might seem hawat tells me the fremen were a deep thorn in the harkonnen side that the extent of their ravages was a carefully guarded secret it wouldnt have helped for the emperor to learn the ineffectiveness of the harkonnen military a fremen housekeeper jessica mused returning to the subject of the shadout mapes shell have the allblue eyes dont let the appearance of these people deceive you he said theres a deep strength and healthy vitality in them i think theyll be everything we need its a dangerous gamble she said lets not go into that again he said she forced a smile we are committed no doubt of that she went through the quick regimen of calmness the two deep breaths the ritual thought then when i assign rooms is there anything special i should reserve for you you must teach me someday how you do that he said the way you thrust your worries aside and turn to practical matters it must be a bene gesserit thing its a female thing she said he smiled well assignment of rooms make certain i have large office space next my sleeping quarters therell be more paper work here than on caladan a guard room of course that should cover it dont worry about security of the house hawats men have been over it in depth im sure they have he glanced at his wristwatch and you might see that all our timepieces are adjusted for arrakeen local ive assigned a tech to take care of it hell be along presently he brushed a strand of her hair back from her forehead i must return to the landing field now the second shuttles due any minute with my staff reserves couldnt hawat meet them my lord you look so tired the good thufir is even busier than i am you know this planets infested with harkonnen intrigues besides i must try persuading some of the trained spice hunters against leaving they have the option you know with the change of fief and this planetologist the emperor and the landsraad installed as judge of the change can not be bought hes allowing the opt about eight hundred trained hands expect to go out on the spice shuttle and theres a guild cargo ship standing by my lord she broke off hesitating yes he will not be persuaded against trying to make this planet secure for us she thought and i can not use my tricks on him at what time will you be expecting dinner she asked thats not what she was going to say he thought ahhhh my jessica would that we were somewhere else anywhere away from this terrible place alone the two of us without a care ill eat in the officers mess at the field he said dont expect me until very late and ah ill be sending a guardcar for paul i want him to attend our strategy conference he cleared his throat as though to say something else then without warning turned and strode out headed for the entry where she could hear more boxes being deposited his voice sounded once from there commanding and disdainful the way he always spoke to servants when he was in a hurry the lady jessicas in the great hall join her there immediately the outer door slammed jessica turned away faced the painting of letos father it had been done by the famed artist albe during the old dukes middle years he was portrayed in matador costume with a magenta cape flung over his left arm the face looked young hardly older than letos now and with the same hawk features the same gray stare she clenched her fists at her sides glared at the painting damn you damn you damn you she whispered what are your orders noble born it was a womans voice thin and stringy jessica whirled stared down at a knobby grayhaired woman in a shapeless sack dress of bondsman brown the woman looked as wrinkled and desiccated as any member of the mob that had greeted them along the way from the landing field that morning every native she had seen on this planet jessica thought looked prune dry and undernourished yet leto had said they were strong and vital and there were the eyes of course that wash of deepest darkest blue without any white secretive mysterious jessica forced herself not to stare the woman gave a stiffnecked nod said i am called the shadout mapes noble born what are your orders you may refer to me as my lady jessica said im not noble born im the bound concubine of the duke leto again that strange nod and the woman peered upward at jessica with a sly questioning theres a wife then there is not nor has there ever been i am the dukes only companion the mother of his heirdesignate even as she spoke jessica laughed inwardly at the pride behind her words what was it st augustine said she asked herself the mind commands the body and it obeys the mind orders itself and meets resistance yes i am meeting more resistance lately i could use a quiet retreat by myself a weird cry sounded from the road outside the house it was repeated soosoosook soosoosook then ikhuteigh ikhuteigh and again soosoosook what is that jessica asked i heard it several times as we drove through the streets this morning only a waterseller my lady but youve no need to interest yourself in such as they the cistern here holds fifty thousand liters and its always kept full she glanced down at her dress why you know my lady i dont even have to wear my stillsuit here she cackled and me not even dead jessica hesitated wanting to question this fremen woman needing data to guide her but bringing order of the confusion in the castle was more imperative still she found the thought unsettling that water was a major mark of wealth here my husband told me of your title shadout jessica said i recognized the word its a very ancient word you know the ancient tongues then mapes asked and she waited with an odd intensity tongues are the bene gesserits first learning jessica said i know the bhotani jib and the chakobsa all the hunting languages mapes nodded just as the legend says and jessica wondered why do i play out this sham but the bene gesserit ways were devious and compelling i know the dark things and the ways of the great mother jessica said she read the more obvious signs in mapes actions and appearance the petit betrayals miseces prejia she said in the chakobsa tongue andral tre pera trada cik buscakri miseces perakri mapes took a backward step appeared poised to flee i know many things jessica said i know that you have borne children that you have lost loved ones that you have hidden in fear and that you have done violence and will yet do more violence i know many things in a low voice mapes said i meant no offense my lady you speak of the legend and seek answers jessica said beware the answers you may find i know you came prepared for violence with a weapon in your bodice my lady i theres a remote possibility you could draw my lifes blood jessica said but in so doing youd bring down more ruin than your wildest fears could imagine there are worse things than dying you know even for an entire people my lady mapes pleaded she appeared about to fall to her knees the weapon was sent as a gift to you should you prove to be the one and as the means of my death should i prove otherwise jessica said she waited in the seeming relaxation that made the bene gesserittrained so terrifying in combat now we see which way the decision tips she thought slowly mapes reached into the neck of her dress brought out a dark sheath a black handle with deep finger ridges protruded from it she took sheath in one hand and handle in the other withdrew a milkwhite blade held it up the blade seemed to shine and glitter with a light of its own it was doubleedged like a kindjal and the blade was perhaps twenty centimeters long do you know this my lady mapes asked it could only be one thing jessica knew the fabled crysknife of arrakis the blade that had never been taken off the planet and was known only by rumor and wild gossip its a crysknife she said say it not lightly mapes said do you know its meaning and jessica thought there was an edge to that question heres the reason this fremen has taken service with me to ask that one question my answer could precipitate violence or what she seeks an answer from me the meaning of a knife shes called the shadow in the chakobsa tongue knife thats death maker in chakobsa shes getting restive i must answer now delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer jessica said its a maker eigheeeeee mapes wailed it was a sound of both grief and elation she trembled so hard the knife blade sent glittering shards of reflection shooting around the room jessica waited poised she had intended to say the knife was a maker of death and then add the ancient word but every sense warned her now all the deep training of alertness that exposed meaning in the most casual muscle twitch the key word was maker maker maker still mapes held the knife as though ready to use it jessica said did you think that i knowing the mysteries of the great mother would not know the maker mapes lowered the knife my lady when one has lived with prophecy for so long the moment of revelation is a shock jessica thought about the prophecy the sharia and all the panoplia propheticus a bene gesserit of the missionaria protectiva dropped here long centuries ago long dead no doubt but her purpose accomplished the protective legends implanted in these people against the day of a bene gesserits need well that day had come mapes returned knife to sheath said this is an unfixed blade my lady keep it near you more than a week away from flesh and it begins to disintegrate its yours a tooth of shaihulud for as long as you live jessica reached out her right hand risked a gamble mapes youve sheathed that blade unblooded with a gasp mapes dropped the sheathed knife into jessicas hand tore open the brown bodice wailing take the water of my life jessica withdrew the blade from its sheath how it glittered she directed the point toward mapes saw a fear greater than deathpanic come over the woman poison in the point jessica wondered she tipped up the point drew a delicate scratch with the blades edge above mapes left breast there was a thick welling of blood that stopped almost immediately ultrafast coagulation jessica thought a moistureconserving mutation she sheathed the blade said button your dress mapes mapes obeyed trembling the eyes without whites stared at jessica you are ours she muttered you are the one there came another sound of unloading in the entry swiftly mapes grabbed the sheathed knife concealed it in jessicas bodice who sees that knife must be cleansed or slain she snarled you know that my lady i know it now jessica thought the cargo handlers left without intruding on the great hall mapes composed herself said the uncleansed who have seen a crysknife may not leave arrakis alive never forget that my lady youve been entrusted with a crysknife she took a deep breath now the thing must take its course it can not be hurried she glanced at the stacked boxes and piled goods around them and theres work aplenty to while the time for us here jessica hesitated the thing must take its course that was a specific catchphrase from the missionaria protectivas stock of incantations the coming of the reverend mother to free you but im not a reverend mother jessica thought and then great mother they planted that one here this must be a hideous place in matteroffact tones mapes said whatll you be wanting me to do first my lady instinct warned jessica to match that casual tone she said the painting of the old duke over there it must be hung on one side of the dining hall the bulls head must go on the wall opposite the painting mapes crossed to the bulls head what a great beast it must have been to carry such a head she said she stooped ill have to be cleaning this first wont i my lady no but theres dirt caked on its horns thats not dirt mapes thats the blood of our dukes father those horns were sprayed with a transparent fixative within hours after this beast killed the old duke mapes stood up ah now she said its just blood jessica said old blood at that get some help hanging these now the beastly things are heavy did you think the blood bothered me mapes asked im of the desert and ive seen blood aplenty i see that you have jessica said and some of it my own mapes said moren you drew with your puny scratch youd rather id cut deeper ah no the bodys water is scant enough thout gushing a wasteful lot of it into the air you did the thing right and jessica noting the words and manner caught the deeper implications in the phrase the bodys water again she felt a sense of oppression at the importance of water on arrakis on which side of the dining hall shall i hang which one of these pretties my lady mapes asked ever the practical one this mapes jessica thought she said use your own judgment mapes it makes no real difference as you say my lady mapes stooped began clearing wrappings and twine from the head killed an old duke did you she crooned shall i summon a handler to help you jessica asked ill manage my lady yes shell manage jessica thought theres that about this fremen creature the drive to manage jessica felt the cold sheath of the crysknife beneath her bodice thought of the long chain of bene gesserit scheming that had forged another link here because of that scheming she had survived a deadly crisis it can not be hurried mapes had said yet there was a tempo of headlong rushing to this place that filled jessica with foreboding and not all the preparations of the missionaria protectiva nor hawats suspicious inspection of this castellated pile of rocks could dispel the feeling when youve finished hanging those start unpacking the boxes jessica said one of the cargo men at the entry has all the keys and knows where things should go get the keys and the list from him if there are any questions ill be in the south wing as you will my lady mapes said jessica turned away thinking hawat may have passed this residency as safe but theres something wrong about the place i can feel it an urgent need to see her son gripped jessica she began walking toward the arched doorway that led into the passage to the dining hall and the family wings faster and faster she walked until she was almost running behind her mapes paused in clearing the wrappings from the bulls head looked at the retreating back shes the one all right she muttered poor thing yueh yueh yueh goes the refrain a million deaths were not enough for yueh from a childs history of muaddib by the princess irulan the door stood ajar and jessica stepped through it into a room with yellow walls to her left stretched a low settee of black hide and two empty bookcases a hanging waterflask with dust on its bulging sides to her right bracketing another door stood more empty bookcases a desk from caladan and three chairs at the windows directly ahead of her stood dr yueh his back to her his attention fixed upon the outside world jessica took another silent step into the room she saw that yuehs coat was wrinkled a white smudge near the left elbow as though he had leaned against chalk he looked from behind like a fleshless stick figure in overlarge black clothing a caricature poised for stringy movement at the direction of a puppet master only the squarish block of head with long ebony hair caught in its silver suk school ring at the shoulder seemed aliveturning slightly to follow some movement outside again she glanced around the room seeing no sign of her son but the closed door on her right she knew let into a small bedroom for which paul had expressed a liking good afternoon dr yueh she said wheres paul he nodded as though to something out the window spoke in an absent manner without turning your son grew tired jessica i sent him into the next room to rest abruptly he stiffened whirled with mustache flopping over his purpled lips forgive me my lady my thoughts were far away i did not mean to be familiar she smiled held out her right hand for a moment she was afraid he might kneel wellington please to use your name like that i weve known each other six years she said its long past time formalities shouldve been dropped between usin private yueh ventured a thin smile thinking i believe it has worked now shell think anything unusual in my manner is due to embarrassment shell not look for deeper reasons when she believes she already knows the answer im afraid i was woolgathering he said whenever i feel especially sorry for you im afraid i think of you as well jessica sorry for me whatever for yueh shrugged long ago he had realized jessica was not gifted with the full truthsay as his wan na had been still he always used the truth with jessica whenever possible it was safest youve seen this place my jessica he stumbled over the name plunged ahead so barren after caladan and the people those townswomen we passed on the way here wailing beneath their veils the way they looked at us she folded her arms across her breast hugging herself feeling the crysknife there a blade ground from a sandworms tooth if the reports were right its just that were strange to themdifferent people different customs theyve known only the harkonnens she looked past him out the windows what were you staring at out there he turned back to the window the people jessica crossed to his side looked to the left toward the front of the house where yuehs attention was focused a line of twenty palm trees grew there the ground beneath them swept clean barren a screen fence separated them from the road upon which robed people were passing jessica detected a faint shimmering in the air between her and the peoplea house shieldand went on to study the passing throng wondering why yueh found them so absorbing the pattern emerged and she put a hand to her cheek the way the passing people looked at the palm trees she saw envy some hate even a sense of hope each person raked those trees with a fixity of expression do you know what theyre thinking yueh asked you profess to read minds she asked those minds he said they look at those trees and they think there are one hundred of us thats what they think she turned a puzzled frown on him why those are date palms he said one date palm requires forty liters of water a day a man requires but eight liters a palm then equals five men there are twenty palms out thereone hundred men but some of those people look at the trees hopefully they but hope some dates will fall except its the wrong season we look at this place with too critical an eye she said theres hope as well as danger here the spice could make us rich with a fat treasury we can make this world into whatever we wish and she laughed silently at herself who am i trying to convince the laugh broke through her restraints emerging brittle without humor but you cant buy security she said yueh turned away to hide his face from her if only it were possible to hate these people instead of love them in her manner in many ways jessica was like his wan na yet that thought carried its own rigors hardening him to his purpose the ways of the harkonnen cruelty were devious wan na might not be dead he had to be certain do not worry for us wellington jessica said the problems ours not yours she thinks i worry for her he blinked back tears and i do of course but i must stand before that black baron with his deed accomplished and take my one chance to strike him where he is weakestin his gloating moment he sighed would it disturb paul if i looked in on him she asked not at all i gave him a sedative hes taking the change well she asked except for getting a bit overtired hes excited but what fifteenyearold wouldnt be under these circumstances he crossed to the door opened it hes in here jessica followed peered into a shadowy room paul lay on a narrow cot one arm beneath a light cover the other thrown back over his head slatted blinds at a window beside the bed wove a loom of shadows across face and blanket jessica stared at her son seeing the oval shape of face so like her own but the hair was the dukescoalcolored and tousled long lashes concealed the limetoned eyes jessica smiled feeling her fears retreat she was suddenly caught by the idea of genetic traces in her sons featuresher lines in eyes and facial outline but sharp touches of the father peering through that outline like maturity emerging from childhood she thought of the boys features as an exquisite distillation out of random patternsendless queues of happenstance meeting at this nexus the thought made her want to kneel beside the bed and take her son in her arms but she was inhibited by yuehs presence she stepped back closed the door softly yueh had returned to the window unable to bear watching the way jessica stared at her son why did wan na never give me children he asked himself i know as a doctor there was no physical reason against it was there some bene gesserit reason was she perhaps instructed to serve a different purpose what could it have been she loved me certainly for the first time he was caught up in the thought that he might be part of a pattern more involuted and complicated than his mind could grasp jessica stopped beside him said what delicious abandon in the sleep of a child he spoke mechanically if only adults could relax like that yes where do we lose it he murmured she glanced at him catching the odd tone but her mind was still on paul thinking of the new rigors in his training here thinking of the differences in his life nowso very different from the life they once had planned for him we do indeed lose something she said she glanced out to the right at a slope humped with a windtroubled graygreen of bushesdusty leaves and dry claw branches the toodark sky hung over the slope like a blot and the milky light of the arrakeen sun gave the scene a silver castlight like the crysknife concealed in her bodice the skys so dark she said thats partly the lack of moisture he said water she snapped everywhere you turn here youre involved with the lack of water its the precious mystery of arrakis he said why is there so little of it theres volcanic rock here therere a dozen power sources i could name theres polar ice they say you cant drill in the desertstorms and sandtides destroy equipment faster than it can be installed if the worms dont get you first theyve never found water traces there anyway but the mystery wellington the real mystery is the wells thatve been drilled up here in the sinks and basins have you read about those first a trickle then nothing he said but wellington thats the mystery the water was there it dries up and never again is there water yet another hole nearby produces the same result a trickle that stops has no one ever been curious about this it is curious he said you suspect some living agency wouldnt that have shown in core samples what would have shown alien plant matter or animal who could recognize it she turned back to the slope the water is stopped something plugs it thats my suspicion perhaps the reasons known he said the harkonnens sealed off many sources of information about arrakis perhaps there was reason to suppress this what reason she asked and then theres the atmospheric moisture little enough of it certainly but theres some its the major source of water here caught in windtraps and precipitators where does that come from the polar caps cold air takes up little moisture wellington there are things here behind the harkonnen veil that bear close investigation and not all of those things are directly involved with the spice we are indeed behind the harkonnen veil he said perhaps well he broke off noting the sudden intense way she was looking at him is something wrong the way you say harkonnen she said even my dukes voice doesnt carry that weight of venom when he uses the hated name i didnt know you had personal reasons to hate them wellington great mother he thought ive aroused her suspicions now i must use every trick my wan na taught me theres only one solution tell the truth as far as i can he said you didnt know that my wife my wan na he shrugged unable to speak past a sudden constriction in his throat then they the words would not come out he felt panic closed his eyes tightly experiencing the agony in his chest and little else until a hand touched his arm gently forgive me jessica said i did not mean to open an old wound and she thought those animals his wife was bene gesseritthe signs are all over him and its obvious the harkonnens killed her heres another poor victim bound to the atreides by a cherem of hate i am sorry he said im unable to talk about it he opened his eyes giving himself up to the internal awareness of grief that at least was truth jessica studied him seeing the upangled cheeks the dark sequins of almond eyes the butter complexion and stringy mustache hanging like a curved frame around purpled lips and narrow chin the creases of his cheeks and forehead she saw were as much lines of sorrow as of age a deep affection for him came over her wellington im sorry we brought you into this dangerous place she said i came willingly he said and that too was true but this whole planets a harkonnen trap you must know that it will take more than a trap to catch the duke leto he said and that too was true perhaps i should be more confident of him she said he is a brilliant tactician weve been uprooted he said thats why were uneasy and how easy it is to kill the uprooted plant she said especially when you put it down in hostile soil are we certain the soils hostile there were water riots when it was learned how many people the duke was adding to the population she said they stopped only when the people learned we were installing new windtraps and condensers to take care of the load there is only so much water to support human life here he said the people know if more come to drink a limited amount of water the price goes up and the very poor die but the duke has solved this it doesnt follow that the riots mean permanent hostility toward him and guards she said guards everywhere and shields you see the blurring of them everywhere you look we did not live this way on caladan give this planet a chance he said but jessica continued to stare hardeyed out the window i can smell death in this place she said hawat sent advance agents in here by the battalion those guards outside are his men the cargo handlers are his men thereve been unexplained withdrawals of large sums from the treasury the amounts mean only one thing bribes in high places she shook her head where thufir hawat goes death and deceit follow you malign him malign i praise him death and deceit are our only hopes now i just do not fool myself about thufirs methods you should keep busy he said give yourself no time for such morbid busy what is it that takes most of my time wellington i am the dukes secretaryso busy that each day i learn new things to fear things even he doesnt suspect i know she compressed her lips spoke thinly sometimes i wonder how much my bene gesserit business training figured in his choice of me what do you mean he found himself caught by the cynical tone the bitterness that he had never seen her expose dont you think wellington she asked that a secretary bound to one by love is so much safer that is not a worthy thought jessica the rebuke came naturally to his lips there was no doubt how the duke felt about his concubine one had only to watch him as he followed her with his eyes she sighed youre right its not worthy again she hugged herself pressing the sheathed crysknife against her flesh and thinking of the unfinished business it represented therell be much bloodshed soon she said the harkonnens wont rest until theyre dead or my duke destroyed the baron can not forget that leto is a cousin of the royal bloodno matter what the distancewhile the harkonnen titles came out of the choam pocketbook but the poison in him deep in his mind is the knowledge that an atreides had a harkonnen banished for cowardice after the battle of corrin the old feud yueh muttered and for a moment he felt an acid touch of hate the old feud had trapped him in its web killed his wan na orworseleft her for harkonnen tortures until her husband did their bidding the old feud had trapped him and these people were part of that poisonous thing the irony was that such deadliness should come to flower here on arrakis the one source in the universe of melange the prolonger of life the giver of health what are you thinking she asked i am thinking that the spice brings six hundred and twenty thousand solaris the decagram on the open market right now that is wealth to buy many things does greed touch even you wellington not greed what then he shrugged futility he glanced at her can you remember your first taste of spice it tasted like cinnamon but never twice the same he said its like lifeit presents a different face each time you take it some hold that the spice produces a learnedflavor reaction the body learning a thing is good for it interprets the flavor as pleasurableslightly euphoric and like life never to be truly synthesized i think it wouldve been wiser for us to go renegade to take ourselves beyond the imperial reach she said he saw that she hadnt been listening to him focused on her words wondering yeswhy didnt she make him do this she could make him do virtually anything he spoke quickly because here was truth and a change of subject would you think it bold of me jessica if i asked a personal question she pressed against the window ledge in an unexplainable pang of disquiet of course not youre my friend why havent you made the duke marry you she whirled head up glaring made him marry me but i should not have asked he said no she shrugged theres good political reasonas long as my duke remains unmarried some of the great houses can still hope for alliance and she sighed motivating people forcing them to your will gives you a cynical attitude toward humanity it degrades everything it touches if i made him do this then it would not be his doing its a thing my wan na might have said he murmured and this too was truth he put a hand to his mouth swallowing convulsively he had never been closer to speaking out confessing his secret role jessica spoke shattering the moment besides wellington the duke is really two men one of them i love very much hes charming witty considerate tendereverything a woman could desire but the other man is cold callous demanding selfishas harsh and cruel as a winter wind thats the man shaped by the father her face contorted if only that old man had died when my duke was born in the silence that came between them a breeze from a ventilator could be heard fingering the blinds presently she took a deep breath said letos rightthese rooms are nicer than the ones in the other sections of the house she turned sweeping the room with her gaze if youll excuse me wellington i want another look through this wing before i assign quarters he nodded of course and he thought if only there were some way not to do this thing that i must do jessica dropped her arms crossed to the hall door and stood there a moment hesitating then let herself out all the time we talked he was hiding something holding something back she thought to save my feelings no doubt hes a good man again she hesitated almost turned back to confront yueh and drag the hidden thing from him but that would only shame him frighten him to learn hes so easily read i should place more trust in my friends many have marked the speed with which muaddib learned the necessities of arrakis the bene gesserit of course know the basis of this speed for the others we can say that muaddib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn and the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn it is shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn and how many more believe learning to be difficult muaddib knew that every experience carries its lesson from the humanity of muaddib by the princess irulan paul lay on the bed feigning sleep it had been easy to palm dr yuehs sleeping tablet to pretend to swallow it paul suppressed a laugh even his mother had believed him asleep he had wanted to jump up and ask her permission to go exploring the house but had realized she wouldnt approve things were too unsettled yet no this way was best if i slip out without asking i havent disobeyed orders and i will stay in the house where its safe he heard his mother and yueh talking in the other room their words were indistinctsomething about the spice the harkonnens the conversation rose and fell pauls attention went to the carved headboard of his beda false headboard attached to the wall and concealing the controls for this rooms functions a leaping fish had been shaped on the wood with thick brown waves beneath it he knew if he pushed the fishs one visible eye that would turn on the rooms suspensor lamps one of the waves when twisted controlled ventilation another changed the temperature quietly paul sat up in bed a tall bookcase stood against the wall to his left it could be swung aside to reveal a closet with drawers along one side the handle on the door into the hall was patterned on an ornithopter thrust bar it was as though the room had been designed to entice him the room and this planet he thought of the filmbook yueh had shown himarrakis his imperial majestys desert botanical testing station it was an old filmbook from before discovery of the spice names flitted through pauls mind each with its picture imprinted by the books mnemonic pulse saguaro burro bush date palm sand verbena evening primrose barrel cactus incense bush smoke tree creosote bush kit fox desert hawk kangaroo mouse names and pictures names and pictures from mans terranic pastand many to be found now nowhere else in the universe except here on arrakis so many new things to learn aboutthe spice and the sandworms a door closed in the other room paul heard his mothers footsteps retreating down the hall dr yueh he knew would find something to read and remain in the other room now was the moment to go exploring paul slipped out of the bed headed for the bookcase door that opened into the closet he stopped at a sound behind him turned the carved headboard of the bed was folding down onto the spot where he had been sleeping paul froze and immobility saved his life from behind the headboard slipped a tiny hunterseeker no more than five centimeters long paul recognized it at oncea common assassination weapon that every child of royal blood learned about at an early age it was a ravening sliver of metal guided by some nearby hand and eye it could burrow into moving flesh and chew its way up nerve channels to the nearest vital organ the seeker lifted swung sideways across the room and back through pauls mind flashed the related knowledge the hunterseeker limitations its compressed suspensor field distorted the vision of its transmitter eye with nothing but the dim light of the room to reflect his target the operator would be relying on motionanything that moved a shield could slow a hunter give time to destroy it but paul had put aside his shield on the bed lasguns would knock them down but lasguns were expensive and notoriously cranky of maintenanceand there was always the peril of explosive pyrotechnics if the laser beam intersected a hot shield the atreides relied on their body shields and their wits now paul held himself in near catatonic immobility knowing he had only his wits to meet this threat the hunterseeker lifted another half meter it rippled through the slatted light from the window blinds back and forth quartering the room i must try to grab it he thought the suspensor field will make it slippery on the bottom i must grip tightly the thing dropped a half meter quartered to the left circled back around the bed a faint humming could be heard from it who is operating that thing paul wondered it has to be someone near i could shout for yueh but it would take him the instant the door opened the hall door behind paul creaked a rap sounded there the door opened the hunterseeker arrowed past his head toward the motion pauls right hand shot out and down gripping the deadly thing it hummed and twisted in his hand but his muscles were locked on it in desperation with a violent turn and thrust he slammed the things nose against the metal doorplate he felt the crunch of it as the nose eye smashed and the seeker went dead in his hand still he held itto be certain pauls eyes came up met the open stare of total blue from the shadout mapes your father has sent for you she said there are men in the hall to escort you paul nodded his eyes and awareness focusing on this odd woman in a sacklike dress of bondsman brown she was looking now at the thing clutched in his hand ive heard of suchlike she said it wouldve killed me not so he had to swallow before he could speak i was its target but it was coming for me because you were moving and he wondered who is this creature then you saved my life she said i saved both our lives seems like you couldve let it have me and made your own escape she said who are you he asked the shadout mapes housekeeper how did you know where to find me your mother told me i met her at the stairs to the weirding room down the hall she pointed to her right your fathers men are still waiting those will be hawats men he thought we must find the operator of this thing go to my fathers men he said tell them ive caught a hunterseeker in the house and theyre to spread out and find the operator tell them to seal off the house and its grounds immediately theyll know how to go about it the operators sure to be a stranger among us and he wondered could it be this creature but he knew it wasnt the seeker had been under control when she entered before i do your bidding manling mapes said i must cleanse the way between us youve put a water burden on me that im not sure i care to support but we fremen pay our debtsbe they black debts or white debts and its known to us that youve a traitor in your midst who it is we can not say but were certain sure of it mayhap theres the hand guided that fleshcutter paul absorbed this in silence a traitor before he could speak the odd woman whirled away and ran back toward the entry he thought to call her back but there was an air about her that told him she would resent it shed told him what she knew and now she was going to do his bidding the house would be swarming with hawats men in a minute his mind went to other parts of that strange conversation weirding room he looked to his left where she had pointed we fremen so that was a fremen he paused for the mnemonic blink that would store the pattern of her face in his memoryprunewrinkled features darkly browned blueonblue eyes without any white in them he attached the label the shadout mapes still gripping the shattered seeker paul turned back into his room scooped up his shield belt from the bed with his left hand swung it around his waist and buckled it as he ran back out and down the hall to the left shed said his mother was someplace down herestairs a weirding room what had the lady jessica to sustain her in her time of trial think you carefully on this bene gesserit proverb and perhaps you will see any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere climb the mountain just a little bit to test that its a mountain from the top of the mountain you can not see the mountain from muaddib family commentaries by the princess irulan at the end of the south wing jessica found a metal stair spiraling up to an oval door she glanced back down the hall again up at the door oval she wondered what an odd shape for a door in a house through the windows beneath the spiral stair she could see the great white sun of arrakis moving on toward evening long shadows stabbed down the hall she returned her attention to the stairs harsh sidelighting picked out bits of dried earth on the open metalwork of the steps jessica put a hand on the rail began to climb the rail felt cold under her sliding palm she stopped at the door saw it had no handle but there was a faint depression on the surface of it where a handle should have been surely not a palm lock she told herself a palm lock must be keyed to one individuals hand shape and palm lines but it looked like a palm lock and there were ways to open any palm lockas she had learned at school jessica glanced back to make certain she was unobserved placed her palm against the depression in the door the most gentle of pressures to distort the linesa turn of the wrist another turn a sliding twist of the palm across the surface she felt the click but there were hurrying footsteps in the hall beneath her jessica lifted her hand from the door turned saw mapes come to the foot of the stairs there are men in the great hall say theyve been sent by the duke to get young master paul mapes said theyve the ducal signet and the guard has identified them she glanced at the door back to jessica a cautious one this mapes jessica thought thats a good sign hes in the fifth room from this end of the hall the small bedroom jessica said if you have trouble waking him call on dr yueh in the next room paul may require a wakeshot again mapes cast a piercing stare at the oval door and jessica thought she detected loathing in the expression before jessica could ask about the door and what it concealed mapes had turned away hurrying back down the hall hawat certified this place jessica thought there cant be anything too terrible in here she pushed the door it swung inward onto a small room with another oval door opposite the other door had a wheel handle an airlock jessica thought she glanced down saw a door prop fallen to the floor of the little room the prop carried hawats personal mark the door was left propped open she thought someone probably knocked the prop down accidentally not realizing the outer door would close on a palm lock she stepped over the lip into the little room why an airlock in a house she asked herself and she thought suddenly of exotic creatures sealed off in special climates special climate that would make sense on arrakis where even the driest of offplanet growing things had to be irrigated the door behind her began swinging closed she caught it and propped it open securely with the stick hawat had left again she faced the wheellocked inner door seeing now a faint inscription etched in the metal above the handle she recognized galach words read o man here is a lovely portion of gods creation then stand before it and learn to love the perfection of thy supreme friend jessica put her weight on the wheel it turned left and the inner door opened a gentle draft feathered her cheek stirred her hair she felt change in the air a richer taste she swung the door wide looked through into massed greenery with yellow sunlight pouring across it a yellow sun she asked herself then filter glass she stepped over the sill and the door swung closed behind a wetplanet conservatory she breathed potted plants and lowpruned trees stood all about she recognized a mimosa a flowering quince a sondagi greenblossomed pleniscenta green and white striped akarso roses even roses she bent to breathe the fragrance of a giant pink blossom straightened to peer around the room rhythmic noise invaded her senses she parted a jungle overlapping of leaves looked through to the center of the room a low fountain stood there small with fluted lips the rhythmic noise was a peeling spooling arc of water falling thudagallop onto the metal bowl jessica sent herself through the quick senseclearing regimen began a methodical inspection of the rooms perimeter it appeared to be about ten meters square from its placement above the end of the hall and from subtle differences in construction she guessed it had been added onto the roof of this wing long after the original buildings completion she stopped at the south limits of the room in front of the wide reach of filter glass stared around every available space in the room was crowded with exotic wetclimate plants something rustled in the greenery she tensed then glimpsed a simple clockset servok with pipe and hose arms an arm lifted sent out a fine spray of dampness that misted her cheeks the arm retracted and she looked at what it had watered a fern tree water everywhere in this roomon a planet where water was the most precious juice of life water being wasted so conspicuously that it shocked her to inner stillness she glanced out at the filteryellowed sun it hung low on a jagged horizon above cliffs that formed part of the immense rock uplifting known as the shield wall filter glass she thought to turn a white sun into something softer and more familiar who could have built such a place leto it would be like him to surprise me with such a gift but there hasnt been time and hes been busy with more serious problems she recalled the report that many arrakeen houses were sealed by airlock doors and windows to conserve and reclaim interior moisture leto had said it was a deliberate statement of power and wealth for this house to ignore such precautions its doors and windows being sealed only against the omnipresent dust but this room embodied a statement far more significant than the lack of waterseals on outer doors she estimated that this pleasure room used water enough to support a thousand persons on arrakispossibly more jessica moved along the window continuing to stare into the room the move brought into view a metallic surface at table height beside the fountain and she glimpsed a white notepad and stylus there partly concealed by an overhanging fan leaf she crossed to the table noted hawats daysigns on it studied a message written on the pad to the lady jessica may this place give you as much pleasure as it has given me please permit the room to convey a lesson we learned from the same teachers the proximity of a desirable thing tempts one to overindulgence on that path lies danger my kindest wishes margot lady fenring jessica nodded remembering that leto had referred to the emperors former proxy here as count fenring but the hidden message of the note demanded immediate attention couched as it was in a way to inform her the writer was another bene gesserit a bitter thought touched jessica in passing the count married his lady even as this thought flicked through her mind she was bending to seek out the hidden message it had to be there the visible note contained the code phrase every bene gesserit not bound by a school injunction was required to give another bene gesserit when conditions demanded it on that path lies danger jessica felt the back of the note rubbed the surface for coded dots nothing the edge of the pad came under her seeking fingers nothing she replaced the pad where she had found it feeling a sense of urgency something in the position of the pad she wondered but hawat had been over this room doubtless had moved the pad she looked at the leaf above the pad the leaf she brushed a finger along the under surface along the edge along the stem it was there her fingers detected the subtle coded dots scanned them in a single passage your son and duke are in immediate danger a bedroom has been designed to attract your son the h loaded it with death traps to be discovered leaving one that may escape detection jessica put down the urge to run back to paul the full message had to be learned her fingers sped over the dots i do not know the exact nature of the menace but it has something to do with a bed the threat to your duke involves defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant the h plan to give you as gift to a minion to the best of my knowledge this conservatory is safe forgive that i can not tell more my sources are few as my count is not in the pay of the h in haste mf jessica thrust the leaf aside whirled to dash back to paul in that instant the airlock door slammed open paul jumped through it holding something in his right hand slammed the door behind him he saw his mother pushed through the leaves to her glanced at the fountain thrust his hand and the thing it clutched under the falling water paul she grabbed his shoulder staring at the hand what is that he spoke casually but she caught the effort behind the tone hunterseeker caught it in my room and smashed its nose but i want to be sure water should short it out immerse it she commanded he obeyed presently she said withdraw your hand leave the thing in the water he brought out his hand shook water from it staring at the quiescent metal in the fountain jessica broke off a plant stem prodded the deadly sliver it was dead she dropped the stem into the water looked at paul his eyes studied the room with a searching intensity that she recognizedthe bg way this place could conceal anything he said ive reason to believe its safe she said my room was supposed to be safe too hawat said it was a hunterseeker she reminded him that means someone inside the house to operate it seeker control beams have a limited range the thing couldve been spirited in here after hawats investigation but she thought of the message of the leaf defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant not hawat surely oh surely not hawat hawats men are searching the house right now he said that seeker almost got the old woman who came to wake me the shadout mapes jessica said remembering the encounter at the stairs a summons from your father to that can wait paul said why do you think this rooms safe she pointed to the note explained about it he relaxed slightly but jessica remained inwardly tense thinking a hunterseeker merciful mother it took all her training to prevent a fit of hysterical trembling paul spoke matter of factly its the harkonnens of course we shall have to destroy them a rapping sounded at the airlock doorthe code knock of one of hawats corps come in paul called the door swung wide and a tall man in atreides uniform with a hawat insignia on his cap leaned into the room there you are sir he said the housekeeper said youd be here he glanced around the room we found a cairn in the cellar and caught a man in it he had a seeker console ill want to take part in the interrogation jessica said sorry my lady we messed him up catching him he died nothing to identify him she asked weve found nothing yet my lady was he an arrakeen native paul asked jessica nodded at the astuteness of the question he has the native look the man said put into that cairn moren a month ago by the look and left there to await our coming stone and mortar where he came through into the cellar were untouched when we inspected the place yesterday ill stake my reputation on it no one questions your thoroughness jessica said i question it my lady we shouldve used sonic probes down there i presume thats what youre doing now paul said yes sir send word to my father that well be delayed at once sir he glanced at jessica its hawats order that under such circumstances as these the young master be guarded in a safe place again his eyes swept the room what of this place ive reason to believe it safe she said both hawat and i have inspected it then ill mount guard outside here mlady until weve been over the house once more he bowed touched his cap to paul backed out and swung the door closed behind him paul broke the sudden silence saying had we better go over the house later ourselves your eyes might see things others would miss this wing was the only place i hadnt examined she said i put if off to last because because hawat gave it his personal attention he said she darted a quick look at his face questioning do you distrust hawat she asked no but hes getting old hes overworked we could take some of the load from him thatd only shame him and impair his efficiency she said a stray insect wont be able to wander into this wing after he hears about this hell be shamed that we must take our own measures he said hawat has served three generations of atreides with honor she said he deserves every respect and trust we can pay him many times over paul said when my father is bothered by something youve done he says bene gesserit like a swear word and what is it about me that bothers your father when you argue with him you are not your father paul and paul thought itll worry her but i must tell her what that mapes woman said about a traitor among us whatre you holding back jessica asked this isnt like you paul he shrugged recounted the exchange with mapes and jessica thought of the message of the leaf she came to sudden decision showed paul the leaf told him its message my father must learn of this at once he said ill radiograph it in code and get if off no she said you will wait until you can see him alone as few as possible must learn about it do you mean we should trust no one theres another possibility she said this message may have been meant to get to us the people who gave it to us may believe its true but it may be that the only purpose was to get this message to us pauls face remained sturdily somber to sow distrust and suspicion in our ranks to weaken us that way he said you must tell your father privately and caution him about this aspect of it she said i understand she turned to the tall reach of filter glass stared out to the southwest where the sun of arrakis was sinkinga yellowed ball above the cliffs paul turned with her said i dont think its hawat either is it possible its yueh hes not a lieutenant or companion she said and i can assure you he hates the harkonnens as bitterly as we do paul directed his attention to the cliffs thinking and it couldnt be gurney or duncan could it be one of the sublieutenants impossible theyre all from families thatve been loyal to us for generationsfor good reason jessica rubbed her forehead sensing her own fatigue so much peril here she looked out at the filteryellowed landscape studying it beyond the ducal grounds stretched a highfenced storage yardlines of spice silos in it with stiltlegged watchtowers standing around it like so many startled spiders she could see at least twenty storage yards of silos reaching out to the cliffs of the shield wallsilos repeated stuttering across the basin slowly the filtered sun buried itself beneath the horizon stars leaped out she saw one bright star so low on the horizon that it twinkled with a clear precise rhythma trembling of light blinkblinkblinkblinkblink paul stirred beside her in the dusky room but jessica concentrated on that single bright star realizing that it was too low that it must come from the shield wall cliffs someone signaling she tried to read the message but it was in no code she had ever learned other lights had come on down on the plain beneath the cliffs little yellows spaced out against blue darkness and one light off to their left grew brighter began to wink back at the cliffvery fast blinksquirt glimmer blink and it was gone the false star in the cliff winked out immediately signals and they filled her with premonition why were lights used to signal across the basin she asked herself why couldnt they use the communications network the answer was obvious the communinet was certain to be tapped now by agents of the duke leto light signals could only mean that messages were being sent between his enemiesbetween harkonnen agents there came a tapping at the door behind them and the voice of hawats man all clear sir mlady time to be getting the young master to his father it is said that the duke leto blinded himself to the perils of arrakis that he walked heedlessly into the pit would it not be more likely to suggest he had lived so long in the presence of extreme danger he misjudged a change in its intensity or is it possible he deliberately sacrificed himself that his son might find a better life all evidence indicates the duke was a man not easily hoodwinked from muaddib family commentaries by the princess irulan the duke leto atreides leaned against a parapet of the landing control tower outside arrakeen the nights first moon an oblate silver coin hung well above the southern horizon beneath it the jagged cliffs of the shield wall shone like parched icing through a dust haze to his left the lights of arrakeen glowed in the hazeyellow white blue he thought of the notices posted now above his signature all through the populous places of the planet our sublime padishah emperor has charged me to take possession of this planet and end all dispute the ritualistic formality of it touched him with a feeling of loneliness who was fooled by that fatuous legalism not the fremen certainly nor the houses minor who controlled the interior trade of arrakis and were harkonnen creatures almost to a man they have tried to take the life of my son the rage was difficult to suppress he saw lights of a moving vehicle coming toward the landing field from arrakeen he hoped it was the guard and troop carrier bringing paul the delay was galling even though he knew it was prompted by caution on the part of hawats lieutenant they have tried to take the life of my son he shook his head to drive out the angry thoughts glanced back at the field where five of his own frigates were posted around the rim like monolithic sentries better a cautious delay than the lieutenant was a good one he reminded himself a man marked for advancement completely loyal our sublime padishah emperor if the people of this decadent garrison city could only see the emperors private note to his noble dukethe disdainful allusions to veiled men and women but what else is one to expect of barbarians whose dearest dream is to live outside the ordered security of the faufreluches the duke felt in this moment that his own dearest dream was to end all class distinctions and never again think of deadly order he looked up and out of the dust at the unwinking stars thought around one of those little lights circles caladan but ill never again see my home the longing for caladan was a sudden pain in his breast he felt that it did not come from within himself but that it reached out to him from caladan he could not bring himself to call this dry wasteland of arrakis his home and he doubted he ever would i must mask my feelings he thought for the boys sake if ever hes to have a home this must be it i may think of arrakis as a hell ive reached before death but he must find here that which will inspire him there must be something a wave of selfpity immediately despised and rejected swept through him and for some reason he found himself recalling two lines from a poem gurney halleck often repeated my lungs taste the air of time blown past falling sands well gurney would find plenty of falling sands here the duke thought the central wastelands beyond those moonfrosted cliffs were desertbarren rock dunes and blowing dust an uncharted dry wilderness with here and there along its rim and perhaps scattered through it knots of fremen if anything could buy a future for the atreides line the fremen just might do it provided the harkonnens hadnt managed to infect even the fremen with their poisonous schemes they have tried to take the life of my son a scraping metal racket vibrated through the tower shook the parapet beneath his arms blast shutters dropped in front of him blocking the view shuttles coming in he thought time to go down and get to work he turned to the stairs behind him headed down to the big assembly room trying to remain calm as he descended to prepare his face for the coming encounter they have tried to take the life of my son the men were already boiling in from the field when he reached the yellowdomed room they carried their spacebags over their shoulders shouting and roistering like students returning from vacation hey feel that under your dogs thats gravity man how many gs does this place pull feels heavy ninetenths of a g by the book the crossfire of thrown words filled the big room did you get a good look at this hole on the way down wheres all the loot this places supposed to have the harkonnens took it with em me for a hot shower and a soft bed havent you heard stupid no showers down here you scrub your ass with sand hey can it the duke the duke stepped out of the stair entry into a suddenly silent room gurney halleck strode along at the point of the crowd bag over one shoulder the neck of his ninestring baliset clutched in the other hand they were longfingered hands with big thumbs full of tiny movements that drew such delicate music from the baliset the duke watched halleck admiring the ugly lump of a man noting the glasssplinter eyes with their gleam of savage understanding here was a man who lived outside the faufreluches while obeying their every precept what was it paul had called him gurney the valorous hallecks wispy blond hair trailed across barren spots on his head his wide mouth was twisted into a pleasant sneer and the scar of the inkvine whip slashed across his jawline seemed to move with a life of its own his whole air was of casual shoulderset capability he came up to the duke bowed gurney leto said my lord he gestured with the baliset toward the men in the room this is the last of them id have preferred coming in with the first wave but there are still some harkonnens for you the duke said step aside with me gurney where we may talk yours to command my lord they moved into an alcove beside a coilslot water machine while the men stirred restlessly in the big room halleck dropped his bag into a corner kept his grip on the baliset how many men can you let hawat have the duke asked is thufir in trouble sire hes lost only two agents but his advance men gave us an excellent line on the entire harkonnen setup here if we move fast we may gain a measure of security the breathing space we require he wants as many men as you can sparemen who wont balk at a little knife work i can let him have three hundred of my best halleck said where shall i send them to the main gate hawat has an agent there waiting to take them shall i get about it at once sire in a moment we have another problem the field commandant will hold the shuttle here until dawn on a pretext the guild heighliner that brought us is going on about its business and the shuttles supposed to make contact with a cargo ship taking up a load of spice our spice mlord our spice but the shuttle also will carry some of the spice hunters from the old regime theyve opted to leave with the change of fief and the judge of the change is allowing it these are valuable workers gurney about eight hundred of them before the shuttle leaves you must persuade some of those men to enlist with us how strong a persuasion sire i want their willing cooperation gurney those men have experience and skills we need the fact that theyre leaving suggests theyre not part of the harkonnen machine hawat believes there could be some bad ones planted in the group but he sees assassins in every shadow thufir has found some very productive shadows in his time mlord and there are some he hasnt found but i think planting sleepers in this outgoing crowd would show too much imagination for the harkonnens possibly sire where are these men down on the lower level in a waiting room i suggest you go down and play a tune or two to soften their minds then turn on the pressure you may offer positions of authority to those who qualify offer twenty per cent higher wages than they received under the harkonnens no more than that sire i know the harkonnen pay scales and to men with their termination pay in their pockets and the wanderlust on them well sire twenty per cent would hardly seem proper inducement to stay leto spoke impatiently then use your own discretion in particular cases just remember that the treasury isnt bottomless hold it to twenty per cent whenever you can we particularly need spice drivers weather scanners dune menany with open sand experience i understand sire they shall come all for violence their faces shall sup up as the east wind and they shall gather the captivity of the sand a very moving quotation the duke said turn your crew over to a lieutenant have him give a short drill on water discipline then bed the men down for the night in the barracks adjoining the field field personnel will direct them and dont forget the men for hawat three hundred of the best sire he took up his spacebag where shall i report to you when ive completed my chores ive taken over a council room topside here well hold staff there i want to arrange a new planetary dispersal order with armored squads going out first halleck stopped in the act of turning away caught letos eye are you anticipating that kind of trouble sire i thought there was a judge of the change here both open battle and secret the duke said therell be blood aplenty spilled here before were through and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land halleck quoted the duke sighed hurry back gurney very good mlord the whipscar rippled to his grin behold as a wild ass in the desert go i forth to my work he turned strode to the center of the room paused to relay his orders hurried on through the men leto shook his head at the retreating back halleck was a continual amazementa head full of songs quotations and flowery phrases and the heart of an assassin when it came to dealing with the harkonnens presently leto took a leisurely diagonal course across to the lift acknowledging salutes with a casual hand wave he recognized a propaganda corpsman stopped to give him a message that could be relayed to the men through channels those who had brought their women would want to know the women were safe and where they could be found the others would wish to know that the population here appeared to boast more women than men the duke slapped the propaganda man on the arm a signal that the message had top priority to be put out immediately then continued across the room he nodded to the men smiled traded pleasantries with a subaltern command must always look confident he thought all that faith riding on your shoulders while you sit in the critical seat and never show it he breathed a sigh of relief when the lift swallowed him and he could turn and face the impersonal doors they have tried to take the life of my son over the exit of the arrakeen landing field crudely carved as though with a poor instrument there was an inscription that muaddib was to repeat many times he saw it that first night on arrakis having been brought to the ducal command post to participate in his fathers first full staff conference the words of the inscription were a plea to those leaving arrakis but they fell with dark import on the eyes of a boy who had just escaped a close brush with death they said o you who know what we suffer here do not forget us in your prayers from manual of muaddib by the princess irulan the whole theory of warfare is calculated risk the duke said but when it comes to risking your own family the element of calculation gets submerged in other things he knew he wasnt holding in his anger as well as he should and he turned strode down the length of the long table and back the duke and paul were alone in the conference room at the landing field it was an emptysounding room furnished only with the long table oldfashioned threelegged chairs around it and a map board and projector at one end paul sat at the table near the map board he had told his father the experience with the hunterseeker and given the reports that a traitor threatened him the duke stopped across from paul pounded the table hawat told me that house was secure paul spoke hesitantly i was angry tooat first and i blamed hawat but the threat came from outside the house it was simple clever and direct and it wouldve succeeded were it not for the training given me by you and many othersincluding hawat are you defending him the duke demanded yes hes getting old thats it he should be hes wise with much experience paul said how many of hawats mistakes can you recall i should be the one defending him the duke said not you paul smiled leto sat down at the head of the table put a hand over his sons youve matured lately son he lifted his hand it gladdens me he matched his sons smile hawat will punish himself hell direct more anger against himself over this than both of us together could pour on him paul glanced toward the darkened windows beyond the map board looked at the nights blackness room lights reflected from a balcony railing out there he saw movement and recognized the shape of a guard in atreides uniform paul looked back at the white wall behind his father then down to the shiny surface of the table seeing his own hands clenched into fists there the door opposite the duke banged open thufir hawat strode through it looking older and more leathery than ever he paced down the length of the table stopped at attention facing leto my lord he said speaking to a point over letos head i have just learned how i failed you it becomes necessary that i tender my resig oh sit down and stop acting the fool the duke said he waved to the chair across from paul if you made a mistake it was in overestimating the harkonnens their simple minds came up with a simple trick we didnt count on simple tricks and my son has been at great pains to point out to me that he came through this largely because of your training you didnt fail there he tapped the back of the empty chair sit down i say hawat sank into the chair but ill hear no more of it the duke said the incident is past we have more pressing business where are the others i asked them to wait outside while i call them in hawat looked into letos eyes sire i i know who my true friends are thufir the duke said call in the men hawat swallowed at once my lord he swiveled in the chair called to the open door gurney bring them in halleck led the file of men into the room the staff officers looking grimly serious followed by the younger aides and specialists an air of eagerness among them brief scuffing sounds echoed around the room as the men took seats a faint smell of rachag stimulant wafted down the table theres coffee for those who want it the duke said he looked over his men thinking theyre a good crew a man could do far worse for this kind of war he waited while coffee was brought in from the adjoining room and served noting the tiredness in some of the faces presently he put on his mask of quiet efficiency stood up and commanded their attention with a knuckle rap against the table well gentlemen he said our civilization appears tove fallen so deeply into the habit of invasion that we can not even obey a simple order of the imperium without the old ways cropping up dry chuckles sounded around the table and paul realized that his father had said the precisely correct thing in precisely the correct tone to lift the mood here even the hint of fatigue in his voice was right i think first wed better learn if thufir has anything to add to his report on the fremen the duke said thufir hawat glanced up ive some economic matters to go into after my general report sire but i can say now that the fremen appear more and more to be the allies we need theyre waiting now to see if they can trust us but they appear to be dealing openly theyve sent us a giftstillsuits of their own manufacture maps of certain desert areas surrounding strongpoints the harkonnens left behind he glanced down at the table their intelligence reports have proved completely reliable and have helped us considerably in our dealings with the judge of the change theyve also sent some incidental thingsjewelry for the lady jessica spice liquor candy medicinals my men are processing the lot right now there appears to be no trickery you like these people thufir asked a man down the table hawat turned to face his questioner duncan idaho says theyre to be admired paul glanced at his father back to hawat ventured a question have you any new information on how many fremen there are hawat looked at paul from food processing and other evidence idaho estimates the cave complex he visited consisted of some ten thousand people all told their leader said he ruled a sietch of two thousand hearths weve reason to believe there are a great many such sietch communities all seem to give their allegiance to someone called liet thats something new leto said it could be an error on my part sire there are things to suggest this liet may be a local deity another man down the table cleared his throat asked is it certain they deal with the smugglers a smuggler caravan left this sietch while idaho was there carrying a heavy load of spice they used pack beasts and indicated they faced an eighteenday journey it appears the duke said that the smugglers have redoubled their operations during this period of unrest this deserves some careful thought we shouldnt worry too much about unlicensed frigates working off our planetits always done but to have them completely outside our observationthats not good you have a plan sire hawat asked the duke looked at halleck gurney i want you to head a delegation an embassy if you will to contact these romantic businessmen tell them ill ignore their operations as long as they give me a ducal tithe hawat here estimates that graft and extra fighting men heretofore required in their operations have been costing them four times that amount what if the emperor gets wind of this halleck asked hes very jealous of his choam profits mlord leto smiled well bank the entire tithe openly in the name of shaddam iv and deduct it legally from our levy support costs let the harkonnens fight that and well be ruining a few more of the locals who grew fat under the harkonnen system no more graft a grin twisted hallecks face ahh mlord a beautiful low blow would that i could see the barons face when he learns of this the duke turned to hawat thufir did you get those account books you said you could buy yes my lord theyre being examined in detail even now ive skimmed them though and can give a first approximation give it then the harkonnens took ten billion solaris out of here every three hundred and thirty standard days a muted gasp ran around the table even the younger aides who had been betraying some boredom sat up straighter and exchanged wideeyed looks halleck murmured for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas and of the treasure hid in the sand you see gentlemen leto said is there anyone here so naive he believes the harkonnens have quietly packed up and walked away from all this merely because the emperor ordered it there was a general shaking of heads murmurous agreement we will have to take it at the point of the sword leto said he turned to hawat thisd be a good point to report on equipment how many sandcrawlers harvesters spice factories and supporting equipment have they left us a full complement as it says in the imperial inventory audited by the judge of the change my lord hawat said he gestured for an aide to pass him a folder opened the folder on the table in front of him they neglect to mention that less than half the crawlers are operable that only about a third have carryalls to fly them to spice sandsthat everything the harkonnens left us is ready to break down and fall apart well be lucky to get half the equipment into operation and luckier yet if a fourth of its still working six months from now pretty much as we expected leto said whats the firm estimate on basic equipment hawat glanced at his folder about nine hundred and thirty harvesterfactories that can be sent out in a few days about sixtytwo hundred and fifty ornithopters for survey scouting and weather observation carryalls a little under a thousand halleck said wouldnt it be cheaper to reopen negotiations with the guild for permission to orbit a frigate as a weather satellite the duke looked at hawat nothing new there eh thufir we must pursue other avenues for now hawat said the guild agent wasnt really negotiating with us he was merely making it plainone mentat to anotherthat the price was out of our reach and would remain so no matter how long a reach we develop our task is to find out why before we approach him again one of hallecks aides down the table swiveled in his chair snapped theres no justice in this justice the duke looked at the man who asks for justice we make our own justice we make it here on arrakiswin or die do you regret casting your lot with us sir the man stared at the duke then no sire you couldnt turn and i could do nought but follow you forgive the outburst but he shrugged we must all feel bitter at times bitterness i understand the duke said but let us not rail about justice as long as we have arms and the freedom to use them do any of the rest of you harbor bitterness if so let it out this is friendly council where any man may speak his mind halleck stirred said i think what rankles sire is that weve had no volunteers from the other great houses they address you as leto the just and promise eternal friendship but only as long as it doesnt cost them anything they dont know yet whos going to win this exchange the duke said most of the houses have grown fat by taking few risks one can not truly blame them for this one can only despise them he looked at hawat we were discussing equipment would you care to project a few examples to familiarize the men with this machinery hawat nodded gestured to an aide at the projector a solido trid projection appeared on the table surface about a third of the way down from the duke some of the men farther along the table stood up to get a better look at it paul leaned forward staring at the machine scaled against the tiny projected human figures around it the thing was about one hundred and twenty meters long and about forty meters wide it was basically a long buglike body moving on independent sets of wide tracks this is a harvester factory hawat said we chose one in good repair for this projection theres one dragline outfit that came in with the first team of imperial ecologists though and its still running although i dont know how or why if thats the one they call old maria it belongs in a museum an aide said i think the harkonnens kept it as a punishment job a threat hanging over their workers heads be good or youll be assigned to old maria chuckles sounded around the table paul held himself apart from the humor his attention focused on the projection and the question that filled his mind he pointed to the image on the table said thufir are there sandworms big enough to swallow that whole quick silence settled on the table the duke cursed under his breath then thought nothey have to face the realities here therere worms in the deep desert could take this entire factory in one gulp hawat said up here closer to the shield wall where most of the spicings done there are plenty of worms that could cripple this factory and devour it at their leisure why dont we shield them paul asked according to idahos report hawat said shields are dangerous in the desert a bodysize shield will call every worm for hundreds of meters around it appears to drive them into a killing frenzy weve the fremen word on this and no reason to doubt it idaho saw no evidence of shield equipment at the sietch none at all paul asked itd be pretty hard to conceal that kind of thing among several thousand people hawat said idaho had free access to every part of the sietch he saw no shields or any indication of their use its a puzzle the duke said the harkonnens certainly used plenty of shields here hawat said they had repair depots in every garrison village and their accounts show a heavy expenditure for shield replacements and parts could the fremen have a way of nullifying shields paul asked it doesnt seem likely hawat said its theoretically possible of coursea shiresized static counter charge is supposed to do the trick but no ones ever been able to put it to the test wed have heard about it before now halleck said the smugglers have close contact with the fremen and wouldve acquired such a device if it were available and theyd have had no inhibitions against marketing it off planet i dont like an unanswered question of this importance leto said thufir i want you to give top priority to solution of this problem were already working on it my lord he cleared his throat ahh idaho did say one thing he said you couldnt mistake the fremen attitude toward shields he said they were mostly amused by them the duke frowned then the subject under discussion is spicing equipment hawat gestured to his aide at the projector the solidoimage of the harvesterfactory was replaced by a projection of a winged device that dwarfed the images of human figures around it this is a carryall hawat said its essentially a large thopter whose sole function is to deliver a factory to spicerich sands then to rescue the factory when a sandworm appears they always appear harvesting the spice is a process of getting in and getting out with as much as possible admirably suited to harkonnen morality the duke said laughter was abrupt and too loud an ornithopter replaced the carryall in the projection focus these thopters are fairly conventional hawat said major modifications give them extended range extra care has been used in sealing essential areas against sand and dust only about one in thirty is shieldedpossibly discarding the shield generators weight for greater range i dont like this deemphasis on shields the duke muttered and he thought is this the harkonnen secret does it mean we wont even be able to escape on shielded frigates if all goes against us he shook his head sharply to drive out such thoughts said lets get to the working estimate whatll our profit figure be hawat turned two pages in his notebook after assessing the repairs and operable equipment weve worked out a first estimate on operating costs its based naturally on a depreciated figure for a clear safety margin he closed his eyes in mentat semitrance said under the harkonnens maintenance and salaries were held to fourteen per cent well be lucky to make it at thirty per cent at first with reinvestment and growth factors accounted for including the choam percentage and military costs our profit margin will be reduced to a very narrow six or seven per cent until we can replace wornout equipment we then should be able to boost it up to twelve or fifteen per cent where it belongs he opened his eyes unless my lord wishes to adopt harkonnen methods were working for a solid and permanent planetary base the duke said we have to keep a large percentage of the people happyespecially the fremen most especially the fremen hawat agreed our supremacy on caladan the duke said depended on sea and air power here we must develop something i choose to call desert power this may include air power but its possible it may not i call your attention to the lack of thopter shields he shook his head the harkonnens relied on turnover from off planet for some of their key personnel we dont dare each new lot would have its quota of provocateurs then well have to be content with far less profit and a reduced harvest hawat said our output the first two seasons should be down a third from the harkonnen average there it is the duke said exactly as we expected well have to move fast with the fremen id like five full battalions of fremen troops before the first choam audit thats not much time sire hawat said we dont have much time as you well know theyll be here with sardaukar disguised as harkonnens at the first opportunity how many do you think theyll ship in thufir four or five battalions all told sire no more guild trooptransport costs being what they are then five battalions of fremen plus our own forces ought to do it let us have a few captive sardaukar to parade in front of the landsraad council and matters will be much differentprofits or no profits well do our best sire paul looked at his father back to hawat suddenly conscious of the mentats great age aware that the old man had served three generations of atreides aged it showed in the rheumy shine of the brown eyes in the cheeks cracked and burned by exotic weathers in the rounded curve of the shoulders and the thin set of his lips with the cranberrycolored stain of sapho juice so much depends on one aged man paul thought were presently in a war of assassins the duke said but it has not achieved full scale thufir whats the condition of the harkonnen machine here weve eliminated two hundred and fiftynine of their key people my lord no more than three harkonnen cells remainperhaps a hundred people in all these harkonnen creatures you eliminated the duke said were they propertied most were well situated my lordin the entrepreneur class i want you to forge certificates of allegiance over the signatures of each of them the duke said file copies with the judge of the change well take the legal position that they stayed under false allegiance confiscate their property take everything turn out their families strip them and make sure the crown gets its ten per cent it must be entirely legal thufir smiled revealing redstained teeth beneath the carmine lips a move worthy of your grandsire my lord it shames me i didnt think of it first halleck frowned across the table surprised a deep scowl on pauls face the others were smiling and nodding its wrong paul thought thisll only make the others fight all the harder theyve nothing to gain by surrendering he knew the actual noholdsbarred convention that ruled in kanly but this was the sort of move that could destroy them even as it gave them victory i have been a stranger in a strange land halleck quoted paul stared at him recognizing the quotation from the oc bible wondering does gurney too wish an end to devious plots the duke glanced at the darkness out the windows looked back at halleck gurney how many of those sandworkers did you persuade to stay with us two hundred eightysix in all sire i think we should take them and consider ourselves lucky theyre all in useful categories no more the duke pursed his lips then well pass the word along to a disturbance at the door interrupted him duncan idaho came through the guard there hurried down the length of the table and bent over the dukes ear leto waved him back said speak out duncan you can see this is strategy staff paul studied idaho marking the feline movements the swiftness of reflex that made him such a difficult weapons teacher to emulate idahos dark round face turned toward paul the cavesitter eyes giving no hint of recognition but paul recognized the mask of serenity over excitement idaho looked down the length of the table said weve taken a force of harkonnen mercenaries disguised as fremen the fremen themselves sent us a courier to warn of the false band in the attack however we found the harkonnens had waylaid the fremen courierbadly wounded him we were bringing him here for treatment by our medics when he died id seen how badly off the man was and stopped to do what i could i surprised him in the attempt to throw something away idaho glanced down at leto a knife mlord a knife the like of which youve never seen crysknife someone asked no doubt of it idaho said milky white and glowing with a light of its own like he reached into his tunic brought out a sheath with a blackridged handle protruding from it keep that blade in its sheath the voice came from the open door at the end of the room a vibrant and penetrating voice that brought them all up staring a tall robed figure stood in the door barred by the crossed swords of the guard a light tan robe completely enveloped the man except for a gap in the hood and black veil that exposed eyes of total blueno white in them at all let him enter idaho whispered pass that man the duke said the guards hesitated then lowered their swords the man swept into the room stood across from the duke this is stilgar chief of the sietch i visited leader of those who warned us of the false band idaho said welcome sir leto said and why shouldnt we unsheath this blade stilgar glanced at idaho said you observed the customs of cleanliness and honor among us i would permit you to see the blade of the man you befriended his gaze swept the others in the room but i do not know these others would you have them defile an honorable weapon i am the duke leto the duke said would you permit me to see this blade ill permit you to earn the right to unsheath it stilgar said and as a mutter of protest sounded around the table he raised a thin darkly veined hand i remind you this is the blade of one who befriended you in the waiting silence paul studied the man sensing the aura of power that radiated from him he was a leadera fremen leader a man near the center of the table across from paul muttered whos he to tell us what rights we have on arrakis it is said that the duke leto atreides rules with the consent of the governed the fremen said thus i must tell you the way it is with us a certain responsibility falls on those who have seen a crysknife he passed a dark glance across idaho they are ours they may never leave arrakis without our consent halleck and several of the others started to rise angry expressions on their faces halleck said the duke leto determines whether one moment please leto said and the very mildness of his voice held them this must not get out of hand he thought he addressed himself to the fremen sir i honor and respect the personal dignity of any man who respects my dignity i am indeed indebted to you and i always pay my debts if it is your custom that this knife remain sheathed here then it is so orderedby me and if there is any other way we may honor the man who died in our service you have but to name it the fremen stared at the duke then slowly pulled aside his veil revealing a thin nose and fulllipped mouth in a glistening black beard deliberately he bent over the end of the table spat on its polished surface as the men around the table started to surge to their feet idahos voice boomed across the room hold into the sudden charged stillness idaho said we thank you stilgar for the gift of your bodys moisture we accept it in the spirit with which it is given and idaho spat on the table in front of the duke aside to the duke he said remember how precious water is here sire that was a token of respect leto sank back into his own chair caught pauls eye a rueful grin on his sons face sensed the slow relaxation of tension around the table as understanding came to his men the fremen looked at idaho said you measured well in my sietch duncan idaho is there a bond on your allegiance to your duke hes asking me to enlist with him sire idaho said would he accept a dual allegiance leto asked you wish me to go with him sire i wish you to make your own decision in the matter leto said and he could not keep the urgency out of his voice idaho studied the fremen would you have me under these conditions stilgar thered be times when id have to return to serve my duke you fight well and you did your best for our friend stilgar said he looked at leto let it be thus the man idaho keeps the crysknife he holds as a mark of his allegiance to us he must be cleansed of course and the rites observed but this can be done he will be fremen and soldier of the atreides there is precedent for this liet serves two masters duncan leto asked i understand sire idaho said it is agreed then leto said your water is ours duncan idaho stilgar said the body of our friend remains with your duke his water is atreides water it is a bond between us leto sighed glanced at hawat catching the old mentats eye hawat nodded his expression pleased i will await below stilgar said while idaho makes farewell with his friends turok was the name of our dead friend remember that when it comes time to release his spirit you are friends of turok stilgar started to turn away will you not stay a while leto asked the fremen turned back whipping his veil into place with a casual gesture adjusting something beneath it paul glimpsed what looked like a thin tube before the veil settled into place is there reason to stay the fremen asked we would honor you the duke said honor requires that i be elsewhere soon the fremen said he shot another glance at idaho whirled and strode out past the door guards if the other fremen match him well serve each other well leto said idaho spoke in a dry voice hes a fair sample sire you understand what youre to do duncan im your ambassador to the fremen sire much depends on you duncan were going to need at least five battalions of those people before the sardaukar descend on us this is going to take some doing sire the fremen are a pretty independent bunch idaho hesitated then and sire theres one other thing one of the mercenaries we knocked over was trying to get this blade from our dead fremen friend the mercenary says theres a harkonnen reward of a million solaris for anyone wholl bring in a single crysknife letos chin came up in a movement of obvious surprise why do they want one of those blades so badly the knife is ground from a sandworms tooth its the mark of the fremen sire with it a blueeyed man could penetrate any sietch in the land theyd question me unless i were known i dont look fremen but piter de vries the duke said a man of devilish cunning my lord hawat said idaho slipped the sheathed knife beneath his tunic guard that knife the duke said i understand mlord he patted the transceiver on his belt kit ill report soon as possible thufir has my call code use battle language he saluted spun about and hurried after the fremen they heard his footsteps drumming down the corridor a look of understanding passed between leto and hawat they smiled weve much to do sire halleck said and i keep you from your work leto said i have the report on the advance bases hawat said shall i give it another time sire will it take long not for a briefing its said among the fremen that there were more than two hundred of these advance bases built here on arrakis during the desert botanical testing station period all supposedly have been abandoned but there are reports they were sealed off before being abandoned equipment in them the duke asked according to the reports i have from duncan where are they located halleck asked the answer to that question hawat said is invariably liet knows god knows leto muttered perhaps not sire hawat said you heard this stilgar use the name could he have been referring to a real person serving two masters halleck said it sounds like a religious quotation and you should know the duke said halleck smiled this judge of the change leto said the imperial ecologistkynes wouldnt he know where those bases are sire hawat cautioned this kynes is an imperial servant and hes a long way from the emperor leto said i want those bases theyd be loaded with materials we could salvage and use for repair of our working equipment sire hawat said those bases are still legally his majestys fief the weather heres savage enough to destroy anything the duke said we can always blame the weather get this kynes and at least find out if the bases exist twere dangerous to commandeer them hawat said duncan was clear on one thing those bases or the idea of them hold some deep significance for the fremen we might alienate the fremen if we took those bases paul looked at the faces of the men around them saw the intensity of the way they followed every word they appeared deeply disturbed by his fathers attitude listen to him father paul said in a low voice he speaks truth sire hawat said those bases could give us material to repair every piece of equipment left us yet be beyond reach for strategic reasons itd be rash to move without greater knowledge this kynes has arbiter authority from the imperium we mustnt forget that and the fremen defer to him do it gently then the duke said i wish to know only if those bases exist as you will sire hawat sat back lowered his eyes all right then the duke said we know what we have ahead of uswork weve been trained for it weve some experience in it we know what the rewards are and the alternatives are clear enough you all have your assignments he looked at halleck gurney take care of that smuggler situation first i shall go unto the rebellious that dwell in the dry land halleck intoned someday ill catch that man without a quotation and hell look undressed the duke said chuckles echoed around the table but paul heard the effort in them the duke turned to hawat set up another command post for intelligence and communications on this floor thufir when you have them ready ill want to see you hawat arose glanced around the room as though seeking support he turned away led the procession out of the room the others moved hurriedly scraping their chairs on the floor balling up in little knots of confusion it ended up in confusion paul thought staring at the backs of the last men to leave always before staff had ended on an incisive air this meeting had just seemed to trickle out worn down by its own inadequacies and with an argument to top it off for the first time paul allowed himself to think about the real possibility of defeatnot thinking about it out of fear or because of warnings such as that of the old reverend mother but facing up to it because of his own assessment of the situation my father is desperate he thought things arent going well for us at all and hawatpaul recalled how the old mentat had acted during the conferencesubtle hesitations signs of unrest hawat was deeply troubled by something best you remain here the rest of the night son the duke said itll be dawn soon anyway ill inform your mother he got to his feet slowly stiffly why dont you pull a few of these chairs together and stretch out on them for some rest im not very tired sir as you will the duke folded his hands behind him began pacing up and down the length of the table like a caged animal paul thought are you going to discuss the traitor possibility with hawat paul asked the duke stopped across from his son spoke to the dark windows weve discussed the possibility many times the old woman seemed so sure of herself paul said and the message mother precautions have been taken the duke said he looked around the room and paul marked the hunted wildness in his fathers eyes remain here there are some things about the command posts i want to discuss with thufir he turned strode out of the room nodding shortly to the door guards paul stared at the place where his father had stood the space had been empty even before the duke left the room and he recalled the old womans warning for the father nothing on that first day when muaddib rode through the streets of arrakeen with his family some of the people along the way recalled the legends and the prophecy and they ventured to shout mahdi but their shout was more a question than a statement for as yet they could only hope he was the one foretold as the lisan algaib the voice from the outer world their attention was focused too on the mother because they had heard she was a bene gesserit and it was obvious to them that she was like the other lisan algaib from manual of muaddib by the princess irulan the duke found thufir hawat alone in the corner room to which a guard directed him there was the sound of men setting up communications equipment in an adjoining room but this place was fairly quiet the duke glanced around as hawat arose from a papercluttered table it was a greenwalled enclosure with in addition to the table three suspensor chairs from which the harkonnen h had been hastily removed leaving an imperfect color patch the chairs are liberated but quite safe hawat said where is paul sire i left him in the conference room im hoping hell get some rest without me there to distract him hawat nodded crossed to the door to the adjoining room closed it shutting off the noise of static and electronic sparking thufir leto said the imperial and harkonnen stockpiles of spice attract my attention mlord the duke pursed his lips storehouses are susceptible to destruction he raised a hand as hawat started to speak ignore the emperors hoard hed secretly enjoy it if the harkonnens were embarrassed and can the baron object if something is destroyed which he can not openly admit that he has hawat shook his head weve few men to spare sire use some of idahos men and perhaps some of the fremen would enjoy a trip off planet a raid on giedi primethere are tactical advantages to such a diversion thufir as you say my lord hawat turned away and the duke saw evidence of nervousness in the old man thought perhaps he suspects i distrust him he must know ive private reports of traitors wellbest quiet his fears immediately thufir he said since youre one of the few i can trust completely theres another matter bears discussion we both know how constant a watch we must keep to prevent traitors from infiltrating our forces but i have two new reports hawat turned stared at him and leto repeated the stories paul had brought instead of bringing on the intense mentat concentration the reports only increased hawats agitation leto studied the old man and presently said youve been holding something back old friend i shouldve suspected when you were so nervous during staff what is it that was too hot to dump in front of the full conference hawats saphostained lips were pulled into a prim straight line with tiny wrinkles radiating into them they maintained their wrinkled stiffness as he said my lord i dont quite know how to broach this weve suffered many a scar for each other thufir the duke said you know you can broach any subject with me hawat continued to stare at him thinking this is how i like him best this is the man of honor who deserves every bit of my loyalty and service why must i hurt him well leto demanded hawat shrugged its a scrap of a note we took it from a harkonnen courier the note was intended for an agent named pardee weve good reason to believe pardee was top man in the harkonnen underground here the noteits a thing that could have great consequence or no consequence its susceptible to various interpretations whats the delicate content of this note scrap of a note my lord incomplete it was on minimic film with the usual destruction capsule attached we stopped the acid action just short of full erasure leaving only a fragment the fragment however is extremely suggestive yes hawat rubbed at his lips it says eto will never suspect and when the blow falls on him from a beloved hand its source alone should be enough to destroy him the note was under the barons own seal and ive authenticated the seal your suspicion is obvious the duke said and his voice was suddenly cold id sooner cut off my arms than hurt you hawat said my lord what if the lady jessica leto said and he felt anger consuming him couldnt you wring the facts out of this pardee unfortunately pardee no longer was among the living when we intercepted the courier the courier im certain did not know what he carried i see leto shook his head thinking what a slimy piece of business there cant be anything in it i know my woman my lord if no the duke barked theres a mistake here that we can not ignore it my lord shes been with me for sixteen years thereve been countless opportunities foryou yourself investigated the school and the woman hawat spoke bitterly things have been known to escape me its impossible i tell you the harkonnens want to destroy the atreides linemeaning paul too theyve already tried once could a woman conspire against her own son perhaps she doesnt conspire against her son and yesterdays attempt couldve been a clever sham it couldnt have been a sham sire she isnt supposed to know her parentage but what if she does know what if she were an orphan say orphaned by an atreides shed have moved long before now poison in my drink a stiletto at night who has had better opportunity the harkonnens mean to destroy you my lord their intent is not just to kill theres a range of fine distinctions in kanly this could be a work of art among vendettas the dukes shoulders slumped he closed his eyes looking old and tired it can not be he thought the woman has opened her heart to me what better way to destroy me than to sow suspicion of the woman i love he asked an interpretation ive considered hawat said still the duke opened his eyes stared at hawat thinking let him be suspicious suspicion is his trade not mine perhaps if i appear to believe this that will make another man careless what do you suggest the duke whispered for now constant surveillance my lord she should be watched at all times i will see its done unobtrusively idaho would be the ideal choice for the job perhaps in a week or so we can bring him back theres a young man weve been training in idahos troop who might be ideal to send to the fremen as a replacement hes gifted in diplomacy dont jeopardize our foothold with the fremen of course not sire and what about paul perhaps we could alert dr yueh leto turned his back on hawat i leave it in your hands i shall use discretion my lord at least i can count on that leto thought and he said i will take a walk if you need me ill be within the perimeter the guard can my lord before you go ive a filmclip you should read its a firstapproximation analysis on the fremen religion youll recall you asked me to report on it the duke paused spoke without turning will it not wait of course my lord you asked what they were shouting though it was mahdi they directed the term at the young master when they at paul yes my lord theyve a legend here a prophecy that a leader will come to them child of a bene gesserit to lead them to true freedom it follows the familiar messiah pattern they think paul is this this they only hope my lord hawat extended a filmclip capsule the duke accepted it thrust it into a pocket ill look at it later certainly my lord right now i need time to think yes my lord the duke took a deep sighing breath strode out the door he turned to his right down the hall began walking hands behind his back paying little attention to where he was there were corridors and stairs and balconies and halls people who saluted and stood aside for him in time he came back to the conference room found it dark and paul asleep on the table with a guards robe thrown over him and a ditty pack for a pillow the duke walked softly down the length of the room and onto the balcony overlooking the landing field a guard at the corner of the balcony recognizing the duke by the dim reflection of lights from the field snapped to attention at ease the duke murmured he leaned against the cold metal of the balcony rail a predawn hush had come over the desert basin he looked up straight overhead the stars were a sequin shawl flung over blueblack low on the southern horizon the nights second moon peered through a thin dust hazean unbelieving moon that looked at him with a cynical light as the duke watched the moon dipped beneath the shield wall cliffs frosting them and in the sudden intensity of darkness he experienced a chill he shivered anger shot through him the harkonnens have hindered and hounded and hunted me for the last time he thought they are dung heaps with village provost minds here i make my stand and he thought with a touch of sadness i must rule with eye and clawas the hawk among lesser birds unconsciously his hand brushed the hawk emblem on his tunic to the east the night grew a faggot of luminous gray then seashell opalescence that dimmed the stars there came the long belltolling movement of dawn striking across a broken horizon it was a scene of such beauty it caught all his attention some things beggar likeness he thought he had never imagined anything here could be as beautiful as that shattered red horizon and the purple and ochre cliffs beyond the landing field where the nights faint dew had touched life into the hurried seeds of arrakis he saw great puddles of red blooms and running through them an articulate tread of violet like giant footsteps its a beautiful morning sire the guard said yes it is the duke nodded thinking perhaps this planet could grow on one perhaps it could become a good home for my son then he saw the human figures moving into the flower fields sweeping them with strange scythelike devicesdew gatherers water so precious here that even the dew must be collected and it could be a hideous place the duke thought there is probably no more terrible instant of enlightenment than the one in which you discover your father is a manwith human flesh from collected sayings of muaddib by the princess irulan the duke said paul im doing a hateful thing but i must he stood beside the portable poison snooper that had been brought into the conference room for their breakfast the things sensor arms hung limply over the table reminding paul of some weird insect newly dead the dukes attention was directed out the windows at the landing field and its roiling of dust against the morning sky paul had a viewer in front of him containing a short filmclip on fremen religious practices the clip had been compiled by one of hawats experts and paul found himself disturbed by the references to himself mahdi lisan algaib he could close his eyes and recall the shouts of the crowds so that is what they hope he thought and he remembered what the old reverend mother had said kwisatz haderach the memories touched his feelings of terrible purpose shading this strange world with sensations of familiarity that he could not understand a hateful thing the duke said what do you mean sir leto turned looked down at his son because the harkonnens think to trick me by making me distrust your mother they dont know that id sooner distrust myself i dont understand sir again leto looked out the windows the white sun was well up into its morning quadrant milky light picked out a boiling of dust clouds that spilled over into the blind canyons interfingering the shield wall slowly speaking in a slow voice to contain his anger the duke explained to paul about the mysterious note you might just as well mistrust me paul said they have to think theyve succeeded the duke said they must think me this much of a fool it must look real even your mother may not know the sham but sir why your mothers response must not be an act oh shes capable of a supreme act but too much rides on this i hope to smoke out a traitor it must seem that ive been completely cozened she must be hurt this way that she does not suffer greater hurt why do you tell me father maybe ill give it away theyll not watch you in this thing the duke said youll keep the secret you must he walked to the windows spoke without turning this way if anything should happen to me you can tell her the truththat i never doubted her not for the smallest instant i should want her to know this paul recognized the death thoughts in his fathers words spoke quickly nothings going to happen to you sir the be silent son paul stared at his fathers back seeing the fatigue in the angle of the neck in the line of the shoulders in the slow movements youre just tired father i am tired the duke agreed im morally tired the melancholy degeneration of the great houses has afflicted me at last perhaps and we were such strong people once paul spoke in quick anger our house hasnt degenerated hasnt it the duke turned faced his son revealing dark circles beneath hard eyes a cynical twist of mouth i should wed your mother make her my duchess yet my unwedded state gives some houses hope they may yet ally with me through their marriageable daughters he shrugged so i mother has explained this to me nothing wins more loyalty for a leader than an air of bravura the duke said i therefore cultivate an air of bravura you lead well paul protested you govern well men follow you willingly and love you my propaganda corps is one of the finest the duke said again he turned to stare out at the basin theres greater possibility for us here on arrakis than the imperium could ever suspect yet sometimes i think itd have been better if wed run for it gone renegade sometimes i wish we could sink back into anonymity among the people become less exposed to father yes i am tired the duke said did you know were using spice residue as raw material and already have our own factory to manufacture filmbase sir we mustnt run short of filmbase the duke said else how could we flood village and city with our information the people must learn how well i govern them how would they know if we didnt tell them you should get some rest paul said again the duke faced his son arrakis has another advantage i almost forgot to mention spice is in everything here you breathe it and eat it in almost everything and i find that this imparts a certain natural immunity to some of the most common poisons of the assassins handbook and the need to watch every drop of water puts all food productionyeast culture hydroponics chemavit everythingunder the strictest surveillance we can not kill off large segments of our population with poisonand we can not be attacked this way either arrakis makes us moral and ethical paul started to speak but the duke cut him off saying i have to have someone i can say these things to son he sighed glanced back at the dry landscape where even the flowers were gone nowtrampled by the dew gatherers wilted under the early sun on caladan we ruled with sea and air power the duke said here we must scrabble for desert power this is your inheritance paul what is to become of you if anything happens to me youll not be a renegade house but a guerrilla houserunning hunted paul groped for words could find nothing to say he had never seen his father this despondent to hold arrakis the duke said one is faced with decisions that may cost one his selfrespect he pointed out the window to the atreides green and black banner hanging limply from a staff at the edge of the landing field that honorable banner could come to mean many evil things paul swallowed in a dry throat his fathers words carried futility a sense of fatalism that left the boy with an empty feeling in his chest the duke took an antifatigue tablet from a pocket gulped it dry power and fear he said the tools of statecraft i must order new emphasis on guerrilla training for you that filmclip therethey call you mahdilisan algaibas a last resort you might capitalize on that paul stared at his father watching the shoulders straighten as the tablet did its work but remembering the words of fear and doubt whats keeping that ecologist the duke muttered i told thufir to have him here early my father the padishah emperor took me by the hand one day and i sensed in the ways my mother had taught me that he was disturbed he led me down the hall of portraits to the egolikeness of the duke leto atreides i marked the strong resemblance between themmy father and this man in the portraitboth with thin elegant faces and sharp features dominated by cold eyes princessdaughter my father said i would that youd been older when it came time for this man to choose a woman my father was at the time and looking no older than the man in the portrait and i was but yet i remember deducing in that instant that my father secretly wished the duke had been his son and disliked the political necessities that made them enemies in my fathers house by the princess irulan his first encounter with the people he had been ordered to betray left dr kynes shaken he prided himself on being a scientist to whom legends were merely interesting clues pointing toward cultural roots yet the boy fitted the ancient prophecy so precisely he had the questing eyes and the air of reserved candor of course the prophecy left certain latitude as to whether the mother goddess would bring the messiah with her or produce him on the scene still there was this odd correspondence between prediction and persons they met in midmorning outside the arrakeen landing fields administration building an unmarked ornithopter squatted nearby humming softly on standby like a somnolent insect an atreides guard stood beside it with bared sword and the faint airdistortion of a shield around him kynes sneered at the shield pattern thinking arrakis has a surprise for them there the planetologist raised a hand signaled for his fremen guard to fall back he strode on ahead toward the buildings entrancethe dark hole in plasticcoated rock so exposed that monolithic building he thought so much less suitable than a cave movement within the entrance caught his attention he stopped taking the moment to adjust his robe and the set of his stillsuit at the left shoulder the entrance doors swung wide atreides guards emerged swiftly all of them heavily armedslowpellet stunners swords and shields behind them came a tall man hawkfaced dark of skin and hair he wore a jubba cloak with atreides crest at the breast and wore it in a way that betrayed his unfamiliarity with the garment it clung to the legs of his stillsuit on one side it lacked a freeswinging striding rhythm beside the man walked a youth with the same dark hair but rounder in the face the youth seemed small for the fifteen years kynes knew him to have but the young body carried a sense of command a poised assurance as though he saw and knew things all around him that were not visible to others and he wore the same style cloak as his father yet with casual ease that made one think the boy had always worn such clothing the mahdi will be aware of things others can not see went the prophecy kynes shook his head telling himself theyre just people with the two garbed like them for the desert came a man kynes recognizedgurney halleck kynes took a deep breath to still his resentment against halleck who had briefed him on how to behave with the duke and ducal heir you may call the duke my lord or sire noble born also is correct but usually reserved for more formal occasions the son may be addressed as young master or my lord the duke is a man of much leniency but brooks little familiarity and kynes thought as he watched the group approach theyll learn soon enough whos master on arrakis order me questioned half the night by that mentat will they expect me to guide them on an inspection of spice mining do they the import of hawats questions had not escaped kynes they wanted the imperial bases and it was obvious theyd learned of the bases from idaho i will have stilgar send idahos head to this duke kynes told himself the ducal party was only a few paces away now their feet in desert boots crunching the sand kynes bowed my lord duke as he had approached the solitary figure standing near the ornithopter leto had studied him tall thin dressed for the desert in loose robe stillsuit and low boots the mans hood was thrown back its veil hanging to one side revealing long sandy hair a sparse beard the eyes were that fathomless bluewithinblue under thick brows remains of dark stains smudged his eye sockets youre the ecologist the duke said we prefer the old title here my lord kynes said planetologist as you wish the duke said he glanced down at paul son this is the judge of the change the arbiter of dispute the man set here to see that the forms are obeyed in our assumption of power over this fief he glanced at kynes and this is my son my lord kynes said are you a fremen paul asked kynes smiled i am accepted in both sietch and village young master but i am in his majestys service the imperial planetologist paul nodded impressed by the mans air of strength halleck had pointed kynes out to paul from an upper window of the administration building the man standing there with the fremen escortthe one moving now toward the ornithopter paul had inspected kynes briefly with binoculars noting the prim straight mouth the high forehead halleck had spoken in pauls ear odd sort of fellow has a precise way of speakingclipped off no fuzzy edgesrazorapt and the duke behind them had said scientist type now only a few feet from the man paul sensed the power in kynes the impact of personality as though he were blood royal born to command i understand we have you to thank for our stillsuits and these cloaks the duke said i hope they fit well my lord kynes said theyre of fremen make and as near as possible the dimensions given me by your man halleck here i was concerned that you said you couldnt take us into the desert unless we wore these garments the duke said we can carry plenty of water we dont intend to be out long and well have air coverthe escort you see overhead right now it isnt likely wed be forced down kynes stared at him seeing the waterfat flesh he spoke coldly you never talk of likelihoods on arrakis you speak only of possibilities halleck stiffened the duke is to be addressed as my lord or sire leto gave halleck their private handsignal to desist said our ways are new here gurney we must make allowances as you wish sire we are indebted to you dr kynes leto said these suits and the consideration for our welfare will be remembered on impulse paul called to mind a quotation from the oc bible said the gift is the blessing of the river the words rang out overloud in the still air the fremen escort kynes had left in the shade of the administration building leaped up from their squatting repose muttering in open agitation one cried out lisan algaib kynes whirled gave a curt chopping signal with a hand waved the guard away they fell back grumbling among themselves trailed away around the building most interesting leto said kynes passed a hard glare over the duke and paul said most of the desert natives here are a superstitious lot pay no attention to them they mean no harm but he thought of the words of the legend they will greet you with holy words and your gifts will be a blessing letos assessment of kynesbased partly on hawats brief verbal report guarded and full of suspicionssuddenly crystallized the man was fremen kynes had come with a fremen escort which could mean simply that the fremen were testing their new freedom to enter urban areasbut it had seemed an honor guard and by his manner kynes was a proud man accustomed to freedom his tongue and his manner guarded only by his own suspicions pauls question had been direct and pertinent kynes had gone native shouldnt we be going sire halleck asked the duke nodded ill fly my own thopter kynes can sit up front with me to direct me you and paul take the rear seats one moment please kynes said with your permission sire i must check the security of your suits the duke started to speak but kynes pressed on i have concern for my own flesh as well as yours my lord im well aware of whose throat would be slit should harm befall you two while youre in my care the duke frowned thinking how delicate this moment if i refuse it may offend him and this could be a man whose value to me is beyond measure yet to let him inside my shield touching my person when i know so little about him the thoughts flicked through his mind with decision hard on their heels were in your hands the duke said he stepped forward opening his robe saw halleck come up on the balls of his feet poised and alert but remaining where he was and if youd be so kind the duke said id appreciate an explanation of the suit from one who lives so intimately with it certainly kynes said he felt up under the robe for the shoulder seals speaking as he examined the suit its basically a microsandwicha highefficiency filter and heatexchange system he adjusted the shoulder seals the skincontact layers porous perspiration passes through it having cooled the body nearnormal evaporation process the next two layers kynes tightened the chest fit include heat exchange filaments and salt precipitators salts reclaimed the duke lifted his arms at a gesture said most interesting breathe deeply kynes said the duke obeyed kynes studied the underarm seals adjusted one motions of the body especially breathing he said and some osmotic action provide the pumping force he loosened the chest fit slightly reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you draw it through this tube in the clip at your neck the duke twisted his chin in and down to look at the end of the tube efficient and convenient he said good engineering kynes knelt examined the leg seals urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads he said and stood up felt the neck fitting lifted a sectioned flap there in the open desert you wear this filter across your face this tube in the nostrils with these plugs to insure a tight fit breathe in through the mouth filter out through the nose tube with a fremen suit in good working order you wont lose more than a thimbleful of moisture a dayeven if youre caught in the great erg a thimbleful a day the duke said kynes pressed a finger against the suits forehead pad said this may rub a little it if irritates you please tell me i could slitpatch it a bit tighter my thanks the duke said he moved his shoulders in the suit as kynes stepped back realizing that it did feel better nowtighter and less irritating kynes turned to paul now lets have a look at you lad a good man but hell have to learn to address us properly the duke thought paul stood passively as kynes inspected the suit it had been an odd sensation putting on the crinkling slicksurfaced garment in his foreconsciousness had been the absolute knowledge that he had never before worn a stillsuit yet each motion of adjusting the adhesion tabs under gurneys inexpert guidance had seemed natural instinctive when he had tightened the chest to gain maximum pumping action from the motion of breathing he had known what he did and why when he had fitted the neck and forehead tabs tightly he had known it was to prevent friction blisters kynes straightened stepped back with a puzzled expression youve worn a stillsuit before he asked this is the first time then someone adjusted it for you no your desert boots are fitted slipfashion at the ankles who told you to do that it seemed the right way that it most certainly is and kynes rubbed his cheek thinking of the legend he shall know your ways as though born to them we waste time the duke said he gestured to the waiting thopter led the way accepting the guards salute with a nod he climbed in fastened his safety harness checked controls and instruments the craft creaked as the others clambered aboard kynes fastened his harness focused on the padded comfort of the aircraftsoft luxury of graygreen upholstery gleaming instruments the sensation of filtered and washed air in his lungs as doors slammed and vent fans whirred alive so soft he thought all secure sire halleck said leto fed power to the wings felt them cup and diponce twice they were airborne in ten meters wings feathered tightly and afterjets thrusting them upward in a steep hissing climb southeast over the shield wall kynes said thats where i told your sandmaster to concentrate his equipment right the duke banked into his air cover the other craft taking up their guard positions as they headed southeast the design and manufacture of these stillsuits bespeaks a high degree of sophistication the duke said someday i may show you a sietch factory kynes said i would find that interesting the duke said i note that suits are manufactured also in some of the garrison cities inferior copies kynes said any dune man who values his skin wears a fremen suit and itll hold your water loss to a thimbleful a day properly suited your forehead cap tight all seals in order your major water loss is through the palms of your hands kynes said you can wear suit gloves if youre not using your hands for critical work but most fremen in the open desert rub their hands with juice from the leaves of the creosote bush it inhibits perspiration the duke glanced down to the left at the broken landscape of the shield wallchasms of tortured rock patches of yellowbrown crossed by black lines of fault shattering it was as though someone had dropped this ground from space and left it where it smashed they crossed a shallow basin with the clear outline of gray sand spreading across it from a canyon opening to the south the sand fingers ran out into the basina dry delta outlined against darker rock kynes sat back thinking about the waterfat flesh he had felt beneath the stillsuits they wore shield belts over their robes slow pellet stunners at the waist coinsized emergency transmitters on cords around their necks both the duke and his son carried knives in wrist sheathes and the sheathes appeared well worn the people struck kynes as a strange combination of softness and armed strength there was a poise to them totally unlike the harkonnens when you report to the emperor on the change of government here will you say we observed the rules leto asked he glanced at kynes back to their course the harkonnens left you came kynes said and is everything as it should be leto asked momentary tension showed in the tightening of a muscle along kynes jaw as planetologist and judge of the change i am a direct subject of the imperium my lord the duke smiled grimly but we both know the realities i remind you that his majesty supports my work indeed and what is your work in the brief silence paul thought hes pushing this kynes too hard paul glanced at halleck but the minstrelwarrior was staring out at the barren landscape kynes spoke stiffly you of course refer to my duties as planetologist of course it is mostly dry land biology and botany some geological workcore drilling and testing you never really exhaust the possibilities of an entire planet do you also investigate the spice kynes turned and paul noted the hard line of the mans cheek a curious question my lord bear in mind kynes that this is now my fief my methods differ from those of the harkonnens i dont care if you study the spice as long as i share what you discover he glanced at the planetologist the harkonnens discouraged investigation of the spice didnt they kynes stared back without answering you may speak plainly the duke said without fear for your skin the imperial court is indeed a long way off kynes muttered and he thought what does this watersoft invader expect does he think me fool enough to enlist with him the duke chuckled keeping his attention on their course i detect a sour note in your voice sir weve waded in here with our mob of tame killers eh and we expect you to realize immediately that were different from the harkonnens ive seen the propaganda youve flooded into sietch and village kynes said love the good duke your corps of here now halleck barked he snapped his attention away from the window leaned forward paul put a hand on hallecks arm gurney the duke said he glanced back this mans been long under the harkonnens halleck sat back ayah your man hawats subtle kynes said but his objects plain enough will you open those bases to us then the duke asked kynes spoke curtly theyre his majestys property theyre not being used they could be used does his majesty concur kynes darted a hard stare at the duke arrakis could be an eden if its rulers would look up from grubbing for spice he didnt answer my question the duke thought and he said how is a planet to become an eden without money what is money kynes asked if it wont buy the services you need ah now the duke thought and he said well discuss this another time right now i believe were coming to the edge of the shield wall do i hold the same course the same course kynes muttered paul looked out his window beneath them the broken ground began to drop away in tumbled creases toward a barren rock plain and a knifeedged shelf beyond the shelf fingernail crescents of dunes marched toward the horizon with here and there in the distance a dull smudge a darker blotch to tell of something not sand rock outcroppings perhaps in the heataddled air paul couldnt be sure are there any plants down there paul asked some kynes said this latitudes lifezone has mostly what we call minor water stealersadapted to raiding each other for moisture gobbling up the tracedew some parts of the desert teem with life but all of it has learned how to survive under these rigors if you get caught down there you imitate that life or you die you mean steal water from each other paul asked the idea outraged him and his voice betrayed his emotion its done kynes said but that wasnt precisely my meaning you see my climate demands a special attitude toward water you are aware of water at all times you waste nothing that contains moisture and the duke thought my climate come around two degrees more southerly my lord kynes said theres a blow coming up from the west the duke nodded he had seen the billowing of tan dust there he banked the thopter around noting the way the escorts wings reflected milky orange from the dustrefracted light as they turned to keep pace with him this should clear the storms edge kynes said that sand must be dangerous if you fly into it paul said will it really cut the strongest metals at this altitude its not sand but dust kynes said the danger is lack of visibility turbulence clogged intakes well see actual spice mining today paul asked very likely kynes said paul sat back he had used the questions and hyperawareness to do what his mother called registering the person he had kynes nowtune of voice each detail of face and gesture an unnatural folding of the left sleeve on the mans robe told of a knife in an arm sheath the waist bulged strangely it was said that desert men wore a belted sash into which they tucked small necessities perhaps the bulges came from such a sashcertainly not from a concealed shield belt a copper pin engraved with the likeness of a hare clasped the neck of kynes robe another smaller pin with similar likeness hung at the corner of the hood which was thrown back over his shoulders halleck twisted in the seat beside paul reached back into the rear compartment and brought out his baliset kynes looked around as halleck tuned the instrument then returned his attention to their course what would you like to hear young master halleck asked you choose gurney paul said halleck bent his ear close to the sounding board strummed a chord and sang softly our fathers ate manna in the desert in the burning places where whirlwinds came lord save us from that horrible land save us ohhhh save us from the dry and thirsty land kynes glanced at the duke said you do travel with a light complement of guards my lord are all of them such men of many talents gurney the duke chuckled gurneys one of a kind i like him with me for his eyes his eyes miss very little the planetologist frowned without missing a beat in his tune halleck interposed for i am like an owl of the desert o aiyah am like an owl of the desert the duke reached down brought up a microphone from the instrument panel thumbed it to life said leader to escort gemma flying object at nine oclock sector b do you identify it its merely a bird kynes said and added you have sharp eyes the panel speaker crackled then escort gemma object examined under full amplification its a large bird paul looked in the indicated direction saw the distant speck a dot of intermittent motion and realized how keyed up his father must be every sense was at full alert id not realized there were birds that large this far into the desert the duke said thats likely an eagle kynes said many creatures have adapted to this place the ornithopter swept over a bare rock plain paul looked down from their two thousand meters altitude saw the wrinkled shadow of their craft and escort the land beneath seemed flat but shadow wrinkles said otherwise has anyone ever walked out of the desert the duke asked hallecks music stopped he leaned forward to catch the answer not from the deep desert kynes said men have walked out of the second zone several times theyve survived by crossing the rock areas where worms seldom go the timbre of kynes voice held pauls attention he felt his sense come alert the way they were trained to do ahh the worms the duke said i must see one sometime you may see one today kynes said wherever there is spice there are worms always halleck asked always is there relationship between worm and spice the duke asked kynes turned and paul saw the pursed lips as the man spoke they defend spice sands each worm has aterritory as to the spice who knows worm specimens weve examined lead us to suspect complicated chemical interchanges within them we find traces of hydrochloric acid in the ducts more complicated acid forms elsewhere ill give you my monograph on the subject and a shields no defense the duke asked shields kynes sneered activate a shield within the worm zone and you seal your fate worms ignore territory lines come from far around to attack a shield no man wearing a shield has ever survived such attack how are worms taken then high voltage electrical shock applied separately to each ring segment is the only known way of killing and preserving an entire worm kynes said they can be stunned and shattered by explosives but each ring segment has a life of its own barring atomics i know of no explosive powerful enough to destroy a large worm entirely theyre incredibly tough why hasnt an effort been made to wipe them out paul asked too expensive kynes said too much area to cover paul leaned back in his corner his truthsense awareness of tone shadings told him that kynes was lying and telling halftruths and he thought if theres a relationship between spice and worms killing the worms would destroy the spice no one will have to walk out of the desert soon the duke said trip these little transmitters at our necks and rescue is on its way all our workers will be wearing them before long were setting up a special rescue service very commendable kynes said your tone says you dont agree the duke said agree of course i agree but it wont be much use static electricity from sandstorms masks out many signals transmitters short out theyve been tried here before you know arrakis is tough on equipment and if a worms hunting you theres not much time frequently you have no more than fifteen or twenty minutes what would you advise the duke asked you ask my advice as planetologist yes youd follow my advice if i found it sensible very well my lord never travel alone the duke turned his attention from the controls thats all thats all never travel alone what if youre separated by a storm and forced down halleck asked isnt there anything you could do any thing covers much territory kynes said what would you do paul asked kynes turned a hard stare at the boy brought his attention back to the duke id remember to protect the integrity of my stillsuit if i were outside the worm zone or in rock id stay with the ship if i were down in open sand id get away from the ship as fast as i could about a thousand meters would be far enough then id hide beneath my robe a worm would get the ship but it might miss me then what halleck asked kynes shrugged wait for the worm to leave thats all paul asked when the worm has gone one may try to walk out kynes said you must walk softly avoid drum sands tidal dust basinshead for the nearest rock zone there are many such zones you might make it drum sand halleck asked a condition of sand compaction kynes said the slightest step sets it drumming worms always come to that and a tidal dust basin the duke asked certain depressions in the desert have filled with dust over the centuries some are so vast they have currents and tides all will swallow the unwary who step into them halleck sat back resumed strumming the baliset presently he sang wild beasts of the desert do hunt there waiting for the innocents to pass ohhh tempt not the gods of the desert lest you seek a lonely epitaph the perils of the he broke off leaned forward dust cloud ahead sire i see it gurney thats what we seek kynes said paul stretched up in the seat to peer ahead saw a rolling yellow cloud low on the desert surface some thirty kilometers ahead one of your factory crawlers kynes said its on the surface and that means its on spice the cloud is vented sand being expelled after the spice has been centrifugally removed theres no other cloud quite like it aircraft over it the duke said i see two three four spotters kynes said theyre watching for wormsign wormsign the duke asked a sandwave moving toward the crawler theyll have seismic probes on the surface too worms sometimes travel too deep for the wave to show kynes swung his gaze around the sky should be a carryall wing around but i dont see it the worm always comes eh halleck asked always paul leaned forward touched kynes shoulder how big an area does each worm stake out kynes frowned the child kept asking adult questions that depends on the size of the worm whats the variation the duke asked big ones may control three or four hundred square kilometers small ones he broke off as the duke kicked on the jet brakes the ship bucked as its tail pods whispered to silence stub wings elongated cupped the air the craft became a full thopter as the duke banked it holding the wings to a gentle beat pointing with his left hand off to the east beyond the factory crawler is that wormsign kynes leaned across the duke to peer into the distance paul and halleck were crowded together looking in the same direction and paul noted that their escort caught by the sudden maneuver had surged ahead but now was curving back the factory crawler lay ahead of them still some three kilometers away where the duke pointed crescent dune tracks spread shadow ripples toward the horizon and running through them as a level line stretching into the distance came an elongated mountinmotiona cresting of sand it reminded paul of the way a big fish disturbed the water when swimming just under the surface worm kynes said big one he leaned back grabbed the microphone from the panel punched out a new frequency selection glancing at the grid chart on rollers over their heads he spoke into the microphone calling crawler at delta ajax niner wormsign warning crawler at delta ajax niner wormsign warning acknowledge please he waited the panel speaker emitted static crackles then a voice who calls delta ajax niner over they seem pretty calm about it halleck said kynes spoke into the microphone unlisted flightnorth and east of you about three kilometers wormsign is on intercept course your position estimated contact twentyfive minutes another voice rumbled from the speaker this is spotter control sighting confirmed stand by for contact fix there was a pause then contact in twentysix minutes minus that was a sharp estimate whos on that unlisted flight over halleck had his harness off and surged forward between kynes and the duke is this the regular working frequency kynes yes why whod be listening just the work crews in this area cuts down interference again the speaker crackled then this is delta ajax niner who gets bonus credit for that spot over halleck glanced at the duke kynes said theres a bonus based on spice load for whoever gives first worm warning they want to know tell them who had first sight of that worm halleck said the duke nodded kynes hesitated then lifted the microphone spotter credit to the duke leto atreides the duke leto atreides over the voice from the speaker was flat and partly distorted by a burst of static we read and thank you now tell them to divide the bonus among themselves halleck ordered tell them its the dukes wish kynes took a deep breath then its the dukes wish that you divide the bonus among your crew do you read over acknowledged and thank you the speaker said the duke said i forgot to mention that gurney is also very talented in public relations kynes turned a puzzled frown on halleck this lets the men know their duke is concerned for their safety halleck said word will get around it was on an area working frequencynot likely harkonnen agents heard he glanced out at their air cover and were a pretty strong force it was a good risk the duke banked their craft toward the sandcloud erupting from the factory crawler what happens now theres a carryall wing somewhere close kynes said itll come in and lift off the crawler what if the carryalls wrecked halleck asked some equipment is lost kynes said get in close over the crawler my lord youll find this interesting the duke scowled busied himself with the controls as they came into turbulent air over the crawler paul looked down saw sand still spewing out of the metal and plastic monster beneath them it looked like a great tan and blue beetle with many wide tracks extending on arms around it he saw a giant inverted funnel snout poked into dark sand in front of it rich spice bed by the color kynes said theyll continue working until the last minute the duke fed more power to the wings stiffened them for a steeper descent as he settled lower in a circling glide above the crawler a glance left and right showed his cover holding altitude and circling overhead paul studied the yellow cloud belching from the crawlers pipe vents looked out over the desert at the approaching worm track shouldnt we be hearing them call in the carryall halleck asked they usually have the wing on a different frequency kynes said shouldnt they have two carryalls standing by for every crawler the duke asked there should be twentysix men on that machine down there not to mention cost of equipment kynes said you dont have enough ex he broke off as the speaker erupted with an angry voice any of you see the wing he isnt answering a garble of noise crackled from the speaker drowned in an abrupt override signal then silence and the first voice report by the numbers over this is spotter control last i saw the wing was pretty high and circling off northwest i dont see him now over spotter one negative over spotter two negative over spotter three negative over silence the duke looked down his own crafts shadow was just passing over the crawler only four spotters is that right correct kynes said there are five in our party the duke said our ships are larger we can crowd in three extra each their spotters ought to be able to lift off two each paul did the mental arithmetic said thats three short why dont they have two carryalls to each crawler barked the duke you dont have enough extra equipment kynes said all the more reason we should protect what we have where could that carryall go halleck asked couldve been forced down somewhere out of sight kynes said the duke grabbed the microphone hesitated with thumb poised over its switch how could they lose sight of a carryall they keep their attention on the ground looking for wormsign kynes said the duke thumbed the switch spoke into the microphone this is your duke we are coming down to take off delta ajax niners crew all spotters are ordered to comply spotters will land on the east side we will take the west over he reached down punched out his own command frequency repeated the order for his own air cover handed the microphone back to kynes kynes returned to the working frequency and a voice blasted from the speaker almost a full load of spice we have almost a full load we cant leave that for a damned worm over damn the spice the duke barked he grabbed back the microphone said we can always get more spice there are seats in our ships for all but three of you draw straws or decide any way you like whos to go but youre going and thats an order he slammed the microphone back into kynes hands muttered sorry as kynes shook an injured finger how much time paul asked nine minutes kynes said the duke said this ship has more power than the others if we took off under jet with threequarter wings we could crowd in an additional man that sands soft kynes said with four extra men aboard on a jet takeoff we could snap the wings sire halleck said not on this ship the duke said he hauled back on the controls as the thopter glided in beside the crawler the wings tipped up braked the thopter to a skidding stop within twenty meters of the factory the crawler was silent now no sand spouting from its vents only a faint mechanical rumble issued from it becoming more audible as the duke opened his door immediately their nostrils were assailed by the odor of cinnamonheavy and pungent with a loud flapping the spotter aircraft glided down to the sand on the other side of the crawler the dukes own escort swooped in to land in line with him paul looking out at the factory saw how all the thopters were dwarfed by itgnats beside a warrior beetle gurney you and paul toss out that rear seat the duke said he manually cranked the wings out to threequarters set their angle checked the jet pod controls why the devil arent they coming out of that machine theyre hoping the carryall will show up kynes said they still have a few minutes he glanced off to the east all turned to look the same direction seeing no sign of the worm but there was a heavy charged feeling of anxiety in the air the duke took the microphone punched for his command frequency said two of you toss out your shield generators by the numbers you can carry one more man that way were not leaving any men for that monster he keyed back to the working frequency barked all right you in delta ajax niner out now this is a command from your duke on the double or ill cut that crawler apart with a lasgun a hatch snapped open near the front of the factory another at the rear another at the top men came tumbling out sliding and scrambling down to the sand a tall man in a patched working robe was the last to emerge he jumped down to a track and then to the sand the duke hung the microphone on the panel swung out onto the wing step shouted two men each into your spotters the man in the patched robe began lolling off pairs of his crew pushing them toward the craft waiting on the other side four over here the duke shouted four into that ship back there he jabbed a finger at an escort thopter directly behind him the guards were just wrestling the shield generator out of it and four into that ship over there he pointed to the other escort that had shed its shield generator three each into the others run you sand dogs the tall man finished counting off his crew came slogging across the sand followed by three of his companions i hear the worm but i cant see it kynes said the others heard it thenan abrasive slithering distant and growing louder damn sloppy way to operate the duke muttered aircraft began flapping off the sand around them it reminded the duke of a time in his home planets jungles a sudden emergence into a clearing and carrion birds lifting away from the carcass of a wild ox the spice workers slogged up to the side of the thopter started climbing in behind the duke halleck helped dragging them into the rear in you go boys he snapped on the double paul crowded into a corner by sweating men smelled the perspiration of fear saw that two of the men had poor neck adjustments on their stillsuits he filed the information in his memory for future action his father would have to order tighter stillsuit discipline men tended to become sloppy if you didnt watch such things the last man came gasping into the rear said the worm its almost on us blast off the duke slid into his seat frowning said we still have almost three minutes on the original contact estimate is that right kynes he shut his door checked it almost exactly my lord kynes said and he thought a cool one this duke all secure here sire halleck said the duke nodded watched the last of his escort take off he adjusted the igniter glanced once more at wings and instruments punched the jet sequence the takeoff pressed the duke and kynes deep into their seats compressed the people in the rear kynes watched the way the duke handled the controlsgently surely the thopter was fully airborne now and the duke studied his instruments glanced left and right at his wings shes very heavy sire halleck said well within the tolerances of this ship the duke said you didnt really think id risk this cargo did you gurney halleck grinned said not a bit of it sire the duke banked his craft in a long easy curveclimbing over the crawler paul crushed into a corner beside a window stared down at the silent machine on the sand the wormsign had broken off about four hundred meters from the crawler and now there appeared to be turbulence in the sand around the factory the worm is now beneath the crawler kynes said you are about to witness a thing few have seen flecks of dust shadowed the sand around the crawler now the big machine began to tip down to the right a gigantic sand whirlpool began forming there to the right of the crawler it moved faster and faster sand and dust filled the air now for hundreds of meters around then they saw it a wide hole emerged from the sand sunlight flashed from glistening white spokes within it the holes diameter was at least twice the length of the crawler paul estimated he watched as the machine slid into that opening in a billow of dust and sand the hole pulled back gods what a monster muttered a man beside paul got all our floggin spice growled another someone is going to pay for this the duke said i promise you that by the very flatness of his fathers voice paul sensed the deep anger he found that he shared it this was criminal waste in the silence that followed they heard kynes bless the maker and his water kynes murmured bless the coming and going of him may his passage cleanse the world may he keep the world for his people whats that youre saying the duke asked but kynes remained silent paul glanced at the men crowded around him they were staring fearfully at the back of kynes head one of them whispered liet kynes turned scowling the man sank back abashed another of the rescued men began coughingdry and rasping presently he gasped curse this hell hole the tall dune man who had come last out of the crawler said be you still coss you but worsen your cough he stirred among the men until he could look through them at the back of the dukes head you be the duke leto i warrant he said its to you we give thanks for our lives we were ready to end it there until you came along quiet man and let the duke fly his ship halleck muttered paul glanced at halleck he too had seen the tension wrinkles at the corner of his fathers jaw one walked softly when the duke was in a rage leto began easing his thopter out of its great banking circle stopped at a new sign of movement on the sand the worm had withdrawn into the depths and now near where the crawler had been two figures could be seen moving north away from the sand depression they appeared to glide over the surface with hardly a lifting of dust to mark their passage whos that down there the duke barked two johnnies who came along for the ride soor said the tall dune man why wasnt something said about them it was the chance they took soor the dune man said my lord said kynes these men know its of little use to do anything about men trapped on the desert in worm country well send a ship from base for them the duke snapped as you wish my lord kynes said but likely when the ship gets here therell be no one to rescue well send a ship anyway the duke said they were right beside where the worm came up paul said howd they escape the sides of the hole cave in and make the distances deceptive kynes said you waste fuel here sire halleck ventured aye gurney the duke brought his craft around toward the shield wall his escort came down from circling stations took up positions above and on both sides paul thought about what the dune man and kynes had said he sensed halftruths outright lies the men on the sand had glided across the surface so surely moving in a way obviously calculated to keep from luring the worm back out of its depths fremen paul thought who else would be so sure on the sand who else might be left out of your worries as a matter of coursebecause they are in no danger they know how to live here they know how to outwit the worm what were fremen doing on that crawler paul asked kynes whirled the tall dune man turned wide eyes on paulblue within blue within blue who be this lad he asked halleck moved to place himself between the man and paul said this is paul atreides the ducal heir why says he there were fremen on our rumbler the man asked they fit the description paul said kynes snorted you cant tell fremen just by looking at them he looked at the dune man you who were those men friends of one of the others the dune man said just friends from a village who wanted to see the spice sands kynes turned away fremen but he was remembering the words of the legend the lisan algaib shall see through all subterfuge they be dead now most likely young soor the dune man said we should not speak unkindly on them but paul heard the falsehood in their voices felt the menace that had brought halleck instinctively into guarding position paul spoke dryly a terrible place for them to die without turning kynes said when god hath ordained a creature to die in a particular place he causeth that creatures wants to direct him to that place leto turned a hard stare at kynes and kynes returning the stare found himself troubled by a fact he had observed here this duke was concerned more over the men that he was over the spice he risked his own life and that of his son to save the men he passed off the loss of a spice crawler with a gesture the threat to mens lives had him in a rage a leader such as that would command fanatic loyalty he would be difficult to defeat against his own will and all previous judgments kynes admitted to himself i like this duke greatness is a transitory experience it is never consistent it depends in part upon the mythmaking imagination of humankind the person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in he must reflect what is projected upon him and he must have a strong sense of the sardonic this is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions the sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself without this quality even occasional greatness will destroy a man from collected sayings of muaddib by the princess irulan in the dining hall of the arrakeen great house suspensor lamps had been lighted against the early dark they cast their yellow glows upward onto the black bulls head with its bloody horns and onto the darkly glistening oil painting of the old duke beneath these talismans white linen shone around the burnished reflections of the atreides silver which had been placed in precise arrangements along the great tablelittle archipelagos of service waiting beside crystal glasses each setting squared off before a heavy wooden chair the classic central chandelier remained unlighted and its chain twisted upward into shadows where the mechanism of the poisonsnooper had been concealed pausing in the doorway to inspect the arrangements the duke thought about the poisonsnooper and what it signified in his society all of a pattern he thought you can plumb us by our languagethe precise and delicate delineations for ways to administer treacherous death will someone try chaumurky tonightpoison in the drink or will it be chaumaspoison in the food he shook his head beside each plate on the long table stood a flagon of water there was enough water along the table the duke estimated to keep a poor arrakeen family for more than a year flanking the doorway in which he stood were broad laving basins of ornate yellow and green tile each basin had its rack of towels it was the custom the housekeeper had explained for guests as they entered to dip their hands ceremoniously into a basin slop several cups of water onto the floor dry their hands on a towel and fling the towel into the growing puddle at the door after the dinner beggars gathered outside to get the water squeezings from the towels how typical of a harkonnen fief the duke thought every degradation of the spirit that can be conceived he took a deep breath feeling rage tighten his stomach the custom stops here he muttered he saw a serving womanone of the old and gnarled ones the housekeeper had recommendedhovering at the doorway from the kitchen across from him the duke signaled with upraised hand she moved out of the shadows scurried around the table toward him and he noted the leathery face the bluewithinblue eyes my lord wishes she kept her head bowed eyes shielded he gestured have these basins and towels removed but noble born she looked up mouth gaping i know the custom he barked take these basins to the front door while were eating and until weve finished each beggar who calls may have a full cup of water understood her leathery face displayed a twisting of emotions dismay anger with sudden insight leto realized that she must have planned to sell the water squeezings from the foottrampled towels wringing a few coppers from the wretches who came to the door perhaps that also was a custom his face clouded and he growled im posting a guard to see that my orders are carried out to the letter he whirled strode back down the passage to the great hall memories rolled in his mind like the toothless mutterings of old women he remembered open water and wavesdays of grass instead of sanddazed summers that had whipped past him like windstorm leaves all gone im getting old he thought ive felt the cold hand of my mortality and in what an old womans greed in the great hall the lady jessica was the center of a mixed group standing in front of the fireplace an open blaze crackled there casting flickers of orange light onto jewels and laces and costly fabrics he recognized in the group a stillsuit manufacturer down from carthag an electronics equipment importer a watershipper whose summer mansion was near his polarcap factory a representative of the guild bank lean and remote that one a dealer in replacement parts for spice mining equipment a thin and hardfaced woman whose escort service for offplanet visitors reputedly operated as cover for various smuggling spying and blackmail operations most of the women in the hall seemed cast from a specific typedecorative precisely turned out an odd mingling of untouchable sensuousness even without her position as hostess jessica would have dominated the group he thought she wore no jewelry and had chosen warm colorsa long dress almost the shade of the open blaze and an earthbrown band around her bronzed hair he realized she had done this to taunt him subtly a reproof against his recent pose of coldness she was well aware that he liked her best in these shadesthat he saw her as a rustling of warm colors nearby more an outflanker than a member of the group stood duncan idaho in glittering dress uniform flat face unreadable the curling black hair neatly combed he had been summoned back from the fremen and had his orders from hawatunder pretext of guarding her you will keep the lady jessica under constant surveillance the duke glanced around the room there was paul in the corner surrounded by a fawning group of the younger arrakeen richece and aloof among them three officers of the house troop the duke took particular note of the young women what a catch a ducal heir would make but paul was treating all equally with an air of reserved nobility hell wear the title well the duke thought and realized with a sudden chill that this was another death thought paul saw his father in the doorway avoided his eyes he looked around at the clusterings of guests the jeweled hands clutching drinks and the unobtrusive inspections with tiny remotecast snoopers seeing all the chattering faces paul was suddenly repelled by them they were cheap masks locked on festering thoughtsvoices gabbling to drown out the loud silence in every breast im in a sour mood he thought and wondered what gurney would say to that he knew his moods source he hadnt wanted to attend this function but his father had been firm you have a placea position to uphold youre old enough to do this youre almost a man paul saw his father emerge from the doorway inspect the room then cross to the group around the lady jessica as leto approached jessicas group the watershipper was asking is it true the duke will put in weather control from behind the man the duke said we havent gone that far in our thinking sir the man turned exposing a bland round face darkly tanned ahh the duke he said we missed you leto glanced at jessica a thing needed doing he returned his attention to the watershipper explained what he had ordered for the laving basins adding as far as im concerned the old custom ends now is this a ducal order mlord the man asked i leave that to your own ah conscience the duke said he turned noting kynes come up to the group one of the women said i think its a very generous gesturegiving water to the someone shushed her the duke looked at kynes noting that the planetologist wore an oldstyle dark brown uniform with epaulets of the imperial civil servant and a tiny gold teardrop of rank at his collar the watershipper asked in an angry voice does the duke imply criticism of our custom this custom has been changed leto said he nodded to kynes marked the frown on jessicas face thought a frown does not become her but itll increase rumors of friction between us with the dukes permission the watershipper said id like to inquire further about customs leto heard the sudden oily tone in the mans voice noted the watchful silence in this group the way heads were beginning to turn toward them around the room isnt it almost time for dinner jessica asked but our guest has some questions leto said and he looked at the watershipper seeing a roundfaced man with large eyes and thick lips recalling hawats memorandum and this watershipper is a man to watchlingar bewt remember the name the harkonnens used him but never fully controlled him water customs are so interesting bewt said and there was a smile on his face im curious what you intend about the conservatory attached to this house do you intend to continue flaunting it in the peoples faces mlord leto held anger in check staring at the man thoughts raced through his mind it had taken bravery to challenge him in his own ducal castle especially since they now had bewts signature over a contract of allegiance the action had taken also a knowledge of personal power water was indeed power here if water facilities were mined for instance ready to be destroyed at a signal the man looked capable of such a thing destruction of water facilities might well destroy arrakis that could well have been the club this bewt held over the harkonnens my lord the duke and i have other plans for our conservatory jessica said she smiled at leto we intend to keep it certainly but only to hold it in trust for the people of arrakis it is our dream that someday the climate of arrakis may be changed sufficiently to grow such plants anywhere in the open bless her leto thought let our watershipper chew on that your interest in water and weather control is obvious the duke said id advise you to diversify your holdings one day water will not be a precious commodity on arrakis and he thought hawat must redouble his efforts at infiltrating this bewts organization and we must start on standby water facilities at once no man is going to hold a club over my head bewt nodded the smile still on his face a commendable dream my lord he withdrew a pace letos attention was caught by the expression on kynes face the man was staring at jessica he appeared transfiguredlike a man in love or caught in a religious trance kynes thoughts were overwhelmed at last by the words of prophecy and they shall share your most precious dream he spoke directly to jessica do you bring the shortening of the way ah dr kynes the watershipper said youve come in from tramping around with your mobs of fremen how gracious of you kynes passed an unreadable glance across bewt said it is said in the desert that possession of water in great amount can inflict a man with fatal carelessness they have many strange sayings in the desert bewt said but his voice betrayed uneasiness jessica crossed to leto slipped her hand under his arm to gain a moment in which to calm herself kynes had said the shortening of the way in the old tongue the phrase translated as kwisatz haderach the planetologists odd question seemed to have gone unnoticed by the others and now kynes was bending over one of the consort women listening to a lowvoiced coquetry kwisatz haderach jessica thought did our missionaria protectiva plant that legend here too the thought fanned her secret hope for paul he could be the kwisatz haderach he could be the guild bank representative had fallen into conversation with the watershipper and bewts voice lifted above the renewed hum of conversations many people have sought to change arrakis the duke saw how the words seemed to pierce kynes jerking the planetologist upright and away from the flirting woman into the sudden silence a house trooper in uniform of a footman cleared his throat behind leto said dinner is served my lord the duke directed a questioning glance down at jessica the custom here is for host and hostess to follow their guests to table she said and smiled shall we change that one too my lord he spoke coldly that seems a goodly custom we shall let it stand for now the illusion that i suspect her of treachery must be maintained he thought he glanced at the guests filing past them who among you believes this lie jessica sensing his remoteness wondered at it as she had done frequently the past week he acts like a man struggling with himself she thought is it because i moved so swiftly setting up this dinner party yet he knows how important it is that we begin to mix our officers and men with the locals on a social plane we are father and mother surrogate to them all nothing impresses that fact more firmly than this sort of social sharing leto watching the guests file past recalled what thufir hawat had said when informed of the affair sire i forbid it a grim smile touched the dukes mouth what a scene that had been and when the duke had remained adamant about attending the dinner hawat had shaken his head i have bad feelings about this my lord hed said things move too swiftly on arrakis thats not like the harkonnens not like them at all paul passed his father escorting a young woman half a head taller than himself he shot a sour glance at his father nodded at something the young woman said her father manufactures stillsuits jessica said im told that only a fool would be caught in the deep desert wearing one of the mans suits whos the man with the scarred face ahead of paul the duke asked i dont place him a late addition to the list she whispered gurney arranged the invitation smuggler gurney arranged at my request it was cleared with hawat although i thought hawat was a little stiff about it the smugglers called tuek esmar tuek hes a power among his kind they all know him here hes dined at many of the houses why is he here everyone here will ask that question she said tuek will sow doubt and suspicion just by his presence hell also serve notice that youre prepared to back up your orders against graftby enforcement from the smugglers end as well this was the point hawat appeared to like im not sure i like it he nodded to a passing couple saw only a few of their guests remained to precede them why didnt you invite some fremen theres kynes she said yes theres kynes he said have you arranged any other little surprises for me he led her into step behind the procession all else is most conventional she said and she thought my darling cant you see that this smuggler controls fast ships that he can be bribed we must have a way out a door of escape from arrakis if all else fails us here as they emerged into the dining hall she disengaged her arm allowed leto to seat her he strode to his end of the table a footman held his chair for him the others settled with a swishing of fabrics a scraping of chairs but the duke remained standing he gave a hand signal and the house troopers in footman uniform around the table stepped back standing at attention uneasy silence settled over the room jessica looking down the length of the table saw a faint trembling at the corners of letos mouth noted the dark flush of anger on his cheeks what has angered him she asked herself surely not my invitation to the smuggler some question my changing of the laving basin custom leto said this is my way of telling you that many things will change embarrassed silence settled over the table they think him drunk jessica thought leto lifted his water flagon held it aloft where the suspensor lights shot beams of reflection off it as a chevalier of the imperium then he said i give you a toast the others grasped their flagons all eyes focused on the duke in the sudden stillness a suspensor light drifted slightly in an errant breeze from the serving kitchen hallway shadows played across the dukes hawk features here i am and here i remain he barked there was an abortive movement of flagons toward mouthsstopped as the duke remained with arm upraised my toast is one of those maxims so dear to our hearts business makes progress fortune passes everywhere he sipped his water the others joined him questioning glances passed among them gurney the duke called from an alcove at letos end of the room came hallecks voice here my lord give us a tune gurney a minor chord from the baliset floated out of the alcove servants began putting plates of food on the table at the dukes gesture releasing themroast desert hare in sauce cepeda aplomage sirian chukka under glass coffee with melange a rich cinnamon odor from the spice wafted across the table a true potaoie served with sparkling caladan wine still the duke remained standing as the guests waited their attention torn between the dishes placed before them and the standing duke leto said in olden times it was the duty of the host to entertain his guests with his own talents his knuckles turned white so fiercely did he grip his water flagon i can not sing but i give you the words of gurneys song consider it another toasta toast to all whove died bringing us to this station an uncomfortable stirring sounded around the table jessica lowered her gaze glanced at the people seated nearest herthere was the roundfaced watershipper and his woman the pale and austere guild bank representative he seemed a whistlefaced scarecrow with his eyes fixed on leto the rugged and scarfaced tuck his bluewithinblue eyes downcast review friendstroops long past review the duke intoned all to fate a weight of pains and dollars their spirits wear our silver collars review friendstroops long past review each a dot of time without pretense or guile with them passes the lure of fortune review friendstroops long past review when our time ends on its rictus smile well pass the lure of fortune the duke allowed his voice to trail off on the last line took a deep drink from his water flagon slammed it back onto the table water slopped over the brim onto the linen the others drank in embarrassed silence again the duke lifted his water flagon and this time emptied its remaining half onto the floor knowing that the others around the table must do the same jessica was first to follow his example there was a frozen moment before the others began emptying their flagons jessica saw how paul seated near his father was studying the reactions around him she found herself also fascinated by what her guests actions revealedespecially among the women this was clean potable water not something already cast away in a sopping towel reluctance to just discard it exposed itself in trembling hands delayed reactions nervous laughter and violent obedience to the necessity one woman dropped her flagon looked the other way as her male companion recovered it kynes though caught her attention most sharply the planetotogist hesitated then emptied his flagon into a container beneath his jacket he smiled at jessica as he caught her watching him raised the empty flagon to her in a silent toast he appeared completely unembarrassed by his action hallecks music still wafted over the room but it had come out of its minor key lilting and lively now as though he were trying to lift the mood let the dinner commence the duke said and sank into his chair hes angry and uncertain jessica thought the loss of that factory crawler hit him more deeply than it should have it must be something more than that loss he acts like a desperate man she lifted her fork hoping in the motion to hide her own sudden bitterness why not he is desperate slowly at first then with increasing animation the dinner got under way the stillsuit manufacturer complimented jessica on her chef and wine we brought both from caladan she said superb he said tasting the chukka simply superb and not a hint of melange in it one gets so tired of the spice in everything the guild bank representative looked across at kynes i understand doctor kynes that another factory crawler has been lost to a worm news travels fast the duke said then its true the banker asked shifting his attention to leto of course its true the duke snapped the blasted carryall disappeared it shouldnt be possible for anything that big to disappear when the worm came there was nothing to recover the crawler kynes said it should not be possible the duke repeated no one saw the carryall leave the banker asked spotters customarily keep their eyes on the sand kynes said theyre primarily interested in wormsign a carryalls complement usually is four mentwo pilots and two journeymen attachers if oneor even two of this crew were in the pay of the dukes foes ahhh i see the banker said and you as judge of the change do you challenge this i shall have to consider my position carefully kynes said and i certainly will not discuss it at table and he thought that pale skeleton of a man he knows this is the kind of infraction i was instructed to ignore the banker smiled returned his attention to his food jessica sat remembering a lecture from her bene gesserit school days the subject had been espionage and counterespionage a plump happyfaced reverend mother had been the lecturer her jolly voice contrasting weirdly with the subject matter a thing to note about any espionage andor counterespionage school is the similar basic reaction pattern of all its graduates any enclosed discipline sets its stamp its pattern upon its students that pattern is susceptible to analysis and prediction now motivational patterns are going to be similar among all espionage agents that is to say there will be certain types of motivation that are similar despite differing schools or opposed aims you will study first how to separate this element for your analysisin the beginning through interrogation patterns that betray the inner orientation of the interrogators secondly by close observation of languagethought orientation of those under analysis you will find it fairly simple to determine the root languages of your subjects of course both through voice inflection and speech pattern now sitting at table with her son and her duke and their guests hearing that guild bank representative jessica felt a chill of realization the man was a harkonnen agent he had the giedi prime speech patternsubtly masked but exposed to her trained awareness as though he had announced himself does this mean the guild itself has taken sides against house atreides she asked herself the thought shocked her and she masked her emotion by calling for a new dish all the while listening for the man to betray his purpose he will shift the conversation next to something seemingly innocent but with ominous overtones she told herself its his pattern the banker swallowed took a sip of wine smiled at something said to him by the woman on his right he seemed to listen for a moment to a man down the table who was explaining to the duke that native arrakeen plants had no thorns i enjoy watching the flights of birds on arrakis the banker said directing his words at jessica all of our birds of course are carrioneaters and many exist without water having become blooddrinkers the stillsuit manufacturers daughter seated between paul and his father at the other end of the table twisted her pretty face into a frown said oh soosoo you say the most disgusting things the banker smiled they call me soosoo because im financial adviser to the water peddlers union and as jessica continued to look at him without comment he added because of the watersellers crysoosoo sook and he imitated the call with such accuracy that many around the table laughed jessica heard the boastful tone of voice but noted most that the young woman had spoken on cuea set piece she had produced the excuse for the banker to say what he had said she glanced at lingar bewt the water magnate was scowling concentrating on his dinner it came to jessica that the banker had said i too control that ultimate source of power on arrakiswater paul had marked the falseness in his dinner companions voice saw that his mother was following the conversation with bene gesserit intensity on impulse he decided to play the foil draw the exchange out he addressed himself to the banker do you mean sir that these birds are cannibals thats an odd question young master the banker said i merely said the birds drink blood it doesnt have to be the blood of their own kind does it it was not an odd question paul said and jessica noted the brittle riposte quality of her training exposed in his voice most educated people know that the worst potential competition for any young organism can come from its own kind he deliberately forked a bite of food from his companions plate ate it they are eating from the same bowl they have the same basic requirements the banker stiffened scowled at the duke do not make the error of considering my son a child the duke said and he smiled jessica glanced around the table noted that bewt had brightened that both kynes and the smuggler tuek were grinning its a rule of ecology kynes said that the young master appears to understand quite well the struggle between life elements is the struggle for the free energy of a system bloods an efficient energy source the banker put down his fork spoke in an angry voice its said that the fremen scum drink the blood of their dead kynes shook his head spoke in a lecturing tone not the blood sir but all of a mans water ultimately belongs to his peopleto his tribe its a necessity when you live near the great flat all waters precious there and the human body is composed of some seventy per cent water by weight a dead man surely no longer requires that water the banker put both hands against the table beside his plate and jessica thought he was going to push himself back leave in a rage kynes looked at jessica forgive me my lady for elaborating on such an ugly subject at table but you were being told falsehood and it needed clarifying youve associated so long with fremen that youve lost all sensibilities the banker rasped kynes looked at him calmly studied the pale trembling face are you challenging me sir the banker froze he swallowed spoke stiffly of course not id not so insult our host and hostess jessica heard the fear in the mans voice saw it in his face in his breathing in the pulse of a vein at his temple the man was terrified of kynes our host and hostess are quite capable of deciding for themselves when theyve been insulted kynes said theyre brave people who understand defense of honor we all may attest to their courage by the fact that they are here now on arrakis jessica saw that leto was enjoying this most of the others were not people all around the table sat poised for flight hands out of sight under the table two notable exceptions were bewt who was openly smiling at the bankers discomfiture and the smuggler tuek who appeared to be watching kynes for a cue jessica saw that paul was looking at kynes in admiration well kynes said i meant no offense the banker muttered if offense was taken please accept my apologies freely given freely accepted kynes said he smiled at jessica resumed eating as though nothing had happened jessica saw that the smuggler too had relaxed she marked this the man had shown every aspect of an aide ready to leap to kynes assistance there existed an accord of some sort between kynes and tuek leto toyed with a fork looked speculatively at kynes the geologists manner indicated a change in attitude toward the house of atreides kynes had seemed colder on their trip over the desert jessica signaled for another course of food and drink servants appeared with langues de lapins de garennered wine and a sauce of mushroomyeast on the side slowly the dinner conversation resumed but jessica heard the agitation in it the brittle quality saw that the banker ate in sullen silence kynes would have killed him without hesitating she thought and she realized that there was an offhand attitude toward killing in kynes manner he was a casual killer and she guessed that this was a fremen quality jessica turned to the stillsuit manufacturer on her left said i find myself continually amazed by the importance of water on arrakis very important he agreed what is this dish its delicious tongues of wild rabbit in a special sauce she said a very old recipe i must have that recipe the man said she nodded ill see that you get it kynes looked at jessica said the newcomer to arrakis frequently underestimates the importance of water here you are dealing you see with the law of the minimum she heard the testing quality in his voice said growth is limited by that necessity which is present in the least amount and naturally the least favorable condition controls the growth rate its rare to find members of a great house aware of planetological problems kynes said water is the least favorable condition for life on arrakis and remember that growth itself can produce unfavorable conditions unless treated with extreme care jessica sensed a hidden message in kynes words but knew she was missing it growth she said do you mean arrakis can have an orderly cycle of water to sustain human life under more favorable conditions impossible the water magnate barked jessica turned her attention to bewt impossible impossible on arrakis he said dont listen to this dreamer all the laboratory evidence is against him kynes looked at bewt and jessica noted that the other conversations around the table had stopped while people concentrated on this new interchange laboratory evidence tends to blind us to a very simple fact kynes said that fact is this we are dealing here with matters that originated and exist outofdoors where plants and animals carry on their normal existence normal bewt snorted nothing about arrakis is normal quite the contrary kynes said certain harmonies could be set up here along selfsustaining lines you merely have to understand the limits of the planet and the pressures upon it itll never be done bewt said the duke came to a sudden realization placing the point where kynes attitude had changedit had been when jessica had spoken of holding the conservatory plants in trust for arrakis what would it take to set up the selfsustaining system doctor kynes leto asked if we can get three per cent of the green plant element on arrakis involved in forming carbon compounds as foodstuffs weve started the cyclic system kynes said waters the only problem the duke asked he sensed kynes excitement felt himself caught up in it water overshadows the other problems kynes said this planet has much oxygen without its usual concomitantswidespread plant life and large sources of free carbon dioxide from such phenomena as volcanoes there are unusual chemical interchanges over large surf ace areas here do you have pilot projects the duke asked weve had a long time in which to build up the tansley effectsmallunit experiments on an amateur basis from which my science may now draw its working facts kynes said there isnt enough water bewt said there just isnt enough water master bewt is an expert on water kynes said he smiled turned back to his dinner the duke gestured sharply down with his right hand barked no i want an answer is there enough water doctor kynes kynes stared at his plate jessica watched the play of emotion on his face he masks himself well she thought but she had him registered now and read that he regretted his words is there enough water the duke demanded there maybe kynes said hes faking uncertainty jessica thought with his deeper truthsense paul caught the underlying motive had to use every ounce of his training to mask his excitement there is enough water but kynes doesnt wish it to be known our planetologist has many interesting dreams bewt said he dreams with the fremenof prophecies and messiahs chuckles sounded at odd places around the table jessica marked themthe smuggler the stillsuit manufacturers daughter duncan idaho the woman with the mysterious escort service tensions are oddly distributed here tonight jessica thought theres too much going on of which im not aware ill have to develop new information sources the duke passed his gaze from kynes to bewt to jessica he felt oddly let down as though something vital had passed him here may be he muttered kynes spoke quickly perhaps we should discuss this another time my lord there are so many the planetologist broke off as an uniformed atreides trooper hurried in through the service door was passed by the guard and rushed to the dukes side the man bent whispering into letos ear jessica recognized the capsign of hawats corps fought down uneasiness she addressed herself to the stillsuit manufacturers feminine companiona tiny darkhaired woman with a doll face a touch of epicanthic fold to the eyes youve hardly touched your dinner my dear jessica said may i order you something the woman looked at the stillsuit manufacturer before answering then im not very hungry abruptly the duke stood up beside his trooper spoke in a harsh tone of command stay seated everyone you will have to forgive me but a matter has arisen that requires my personal attention he stepped aside paul take over as host for me if you please paul stood wanting to ask why his father had to leave knowing he had to play this with the grand manner he moved around to his fathers chair sat down in it the duke turned to the alcove where halleck sat said gurney please take pauls place at table we mustnt have an odd number here when the dinners over i may want you to bring paul to the field cp wait for my call halleck emerged from the alcove in dress uniform his lumpy ugliness seeming out of place in the glittering finery he leaned his baliset against the wall crossed to the chair paul had occupied sat down theres no need for alarm the duke said but i must ask that no one leave until our house guard says its safe you will be perfectly secure as long as you remain here and well have this little trouble cleared up very shortly paul caught the code words in his fathers messageguardsafesecureshortly the problem was security not violence he saw that his mother had read the same message they both relaxed the duke gave a short nod wheeled and strode through the service door followed by his trooper paul said please go on with your dinner i believe doctor kynes was discussing water may we discuss it another time kynes asked by all means paul said and jessica noted with pride her sons dignity the mature sense of assurance the banker picked up his water flagon gestured with it at bewt none of us here can surpass master lingar bewt in flowery phrases one might almost assume he aspired to great house status come master bewt lead us in a toast perhaps youve a dollop of wisdom for the boy who must be treated like a man jessica clenched her right hand into a fist beneath the table she saw a handsignal pass from halleck to idaho saw the house troopers along the walls move into positions of maximum guard bewt cast a venomous glare at the banker paul glanced at halleck took in the defensive positions of his guards looked at the banker until the man lowered the water flagon he said once on caladan i saw the body of a drowned fisherman recovered he drowned it was the stillsuit manufacturers daughter paul hesitated then yes immersed in water until dead drowned what an interesting way to die she murmured pauls smile became brittle he returned his attention to the banker the interesting thing about this man was the wounds on his shouldersmade by another fishermans clawboots this fisherman was one of several in a boata craft for traveling on waterthat foundered sank beneath the water another fisherman helping recover the body said hed seen marks like this mans wounds several times they meant another drowning fisherman had tried to stand on this poor fellows shoulders in the attempt to reach up to the surfaceto reach air why is this interesting the banker asked because of an observation made by my father at the time he said the drowning man who climbs on your shoulders to save himself is understandableexcept when you see it happen in the drawing room paul hesitated just long enough for the banker to see the point coming then and i should add except when you see it at the dinner table a sudden stillness enfolded the room that was rash jessica thought this banker might have enough rank to call my son out she saw that idaho was poised for instant action the house troopers were alert gurney halleck had his eyes on the men opposite him hohohoooo it was the smuggler tuek head thrown back laughing with complete abandon nervous smiles appeared around the table bewt was grinning the banker had pushed his chair back was glaring at paul kynes said one baits an atreides at his own risk is it atreides custom to insult their guests the banker demanded before paul could answer jessica leaned forward said sir and she thought we must learn this harkonnen creatures game is he here to try for paul does he have help my son displays a general garment and you claim its cut to your fit jessica asked what a fascinating revelation she slid a hand down to her leg to the crysknife she had fastened in a calfsheath the banker turned his glare on jessica eyes shifted away from paul and she saw him ease himself back from the table freeing himself for action he had focused on the code word garment prepare for violence kynes directed a speculative look at jessica gave a subtle hand signal to tuek the smuggler lurched to his feet lifted his flagon ill give you a toast he said to young paul atreides still a lad by his looks but a man by his actions why do they intrude jessica asked herself the banker stared now at kynes and jessica saw terror return to the agents face people began responding all around the table where kynes leads people follow jessica thought he has told us he sides with paul whats the secret of his power it cant be because hes judge of the change thats temporary and certainly not because hes a civil servant she removed her hand from the crysknife hilt lifted her flagon to kynes who responded in kind only paul and the banker soosoo what an idiotic nickname jessica thoughtremained emptyhanded the bankers attention stayed fixed on kynes paul stared at his plate i was handling it correctly paul thought why do they interfere he glanced covertly at the male guests nearest him prepare for violence from whom certainly not from that banker fellow halleck stirred spoke as though to no one in particular directing his words over the heads of the guests across from him in our society people shouldnt be quick to take offense its frequently suicidal he looked at the stillsuit manufacturers daughter beside him dont you think so miss oh yes yes indeed i do she said theres too much violence it makes me sick and lots of times no offense is meant but people die anyway it doesnt make sense indeed it doesnt halleck said jessica saw the near perfection of the girls act realized that emptyheaded little female is not an emptyheaded little female she saw then the pattern of the threat and understood that halleck too had detected it they had planned to lure paul with sex jessica relaxed her son had probably been the first to see ithis training hadnt overlooked that obvious gambit kynes spoke to the banker isnt another apology in order the banker turned a sickly grin toward jessica said my lady i fear ive overindulged in your wines you serve potent drink at table and im not accustomed to it jessica heard the venom beneath his tone spoke sweetly when strangers meet great allowance should be made for differences of custom and training thank you my lady he said the darkhaired companion of the stillsuit manufacturer leaned toward jessica said the duke spoke of our being secure here i do hope that doesnt mean more fighting she was directed to lead the conversation this way jessica thought likely this will prove unimportant jessica said but theres so much detail requiring the dukes personal attention in these times as long as enmity continues between atreides and harkonnen we can not be too careful the duke has sworn kanly he will leave no harkonnen agent alive on arrakis of course she glanced at the guild bank agent and the conventions naturally support him in this she shifted her attention to kynes is this not so dr kynes indeed it is kynes said the stillsuit manufacturer pulled his companion gently back she looked at him said i do believe ill eat something now id like some of that bird dish you served earlier jessica signaled a servant turned to the banker and you sir were speaking of birds earlier and of their habits i find so many interesting things about arrakis tell me where is the spice found do the hunters go deep into the desert oh no my lady he said very littles known of the deep desert and almost nothing of the southern regions theres a tale that a great mother lode of spice is to be found in the southern reaches kynes said but i suspect it was an imaginative invention made solely for purposes of a song some daring spice hunters do on occasion penetrate into the edge of the central belt but thats extremely dangerousnavigation is uncertain storms are frequent casualties increase dramatically the farther you operate from shield wall bases it hasnt been found profitable to venture too far south perhaps if we had a weather satellite bewt looked up spoke around a mouthful of food its said the fremen travel there that they go anywhere and have hunted out soaks and sipwells even in the southern latitudes soaks and sipwells jessica asked kynes spoke quickly wild rumors my lady these are known on other planets not on arrakis a soak is a place where water seeps to the surface or near enough to the surface to be found by digging according to certain signs a sipwell is a form of soak where a person draws water through a straw so it is said theres deception in his words jessica thought why is he lying paul wondered how very interesting jessica said and she thought it is said what a curious speech mannerism they have here if they only knew what it reveals about their dependence on superstitions ive heard you have a saying paul said that polish comes from the cities wisdom from the desert there are many sayings on arrakis kynes said before jessica could frame a new question a servant bent over her with a note she opened it saw the dukes handwriting and code signs scanned it youll all be delighted to know she said that our duke sends his reassurances the matter which called him away has been settled the missing carryall has been found a harkonnen agent in the crew overpowered the others and flew the machine to a smugglers base hoping to sell it there both man and machine were turned over to our forces she nodded to tuek the smuggler nodded back jessica refolded the note tucked it into her sleeve im glad it didnt come to open battle the banker said the people have such hopes the atreides will bring peace and prosperity especially prosperity bewt said shall we have our dessert now jessica asked ive had our chef prepare a caladan sweet pongi rice in sauce dolsa it sounds wonderful the stillsuit manufacturer said would it be possible to get the recipe any recipe you desire jessica said registering the man for later mention to hawat the stillsuit manufacturer was a fearful little climber and could be bought small talk resumed around her such a lovely fabric he is having a setting made to match the jewel we might try for a production increase next quarter jessica stared down at her plate thinking of the coded part of letos message the harkonnens tried to get in a shipment of lasguns we captured them this may mean theyve succeeded with other shipments it certainly means they dont place much store in shields take appropriate precautions jessica focused her mind on lasguns wondering the whitehot beams of disruptive light could cut through any known substance provided that substance was not shielded the fact that feedback from a shield would explode both lasgun and shield did not bother the harkonnens why a lasgunshield explosion was a dangerous variable could be more powerful than atomics could kill only the gunner and his shielded target the unknowns here filled her with uneasiness paul said i never doubted wed find the carryall once my father moves to solve a problem he solves it this is a fact the harkonnens are beginning to discover hes boasting jessica thought he shouldnt boast no person wholl be sleeping far below ground level this night as a precaution against lasguns has the right to boast there is no escapewe pay for the violence of our ancestors from the collected sayings of muaddib by the princess irulan jessica heard the disturbance in the great hall turned on the light beside her bed the clock there had not been properly adjusted to local time and she had to subtract twentyone minutes to determine that it was about am the disturbance was loud and incoherent is this the harkonnen attack she wondered she slipped out of bed checked the screen monitors to see where her family was the screen showed paul asleep in the deep cellar room theyd hastily converted to a bedroom for him the noise obviously wasnt penetrating to his quarters there was no one in the dukes room his bed was unrumpled was he still at the field cp there were no screens yet to the front of the house jessica stood in the middle of her room listening there was one shouting incoherent voice she heard someone call for dr yueh jessica found a robe pulled it over her shoulders pushed her feet into slippers strapped the crysknife to her leg again a voice called out for yueh jessica belted the robe around her stepped into the hallway then the thought struck her what if letos hurt the hall seemed to stretch out forever under her running feet she turned through the arch at the end dashed past the dining hall and down the passage to the great hall finding the place brightly lighted all the wall suspensors glowing at maximum to her right near the front entry she saw two house guards holding duncan idaho between them his head lolled forward and there was an abrupt panting silence to the scene one of the house guards spoke accusingly to idaho you see what you did you woke the lady jessica the great draperies billowed behind the men showing that the front door remained open there was no sign of the duke or yueh mapes stood to one side staring coldly at idaho she wore a long brown robe with serpentine design at the hem her feet were pushed into unlaced desert boots so i woke the lady jessica idaho muttered he lifted his face toward the ceiling bellowed my sword was firs blooded on grumman great mother hes drunk jessica thought idahos dark round face was drawn into a frown his hair curling like the fur of a black goat was plastered with dirt a jagged rent in his tunic exposed an expanse of the dress shirt he had worn at the dinner party earlier jessica crossed to him one of the guards nodded to her without releasing his hold on idaho we didnt know what to do with him my lady he was creating a disturbance out front refusing to come inside we were afraid locals might come along and see him that wouldnt do at all give us a bad name here where has he been jessica asked he escorted one of the young ladies home from the dinner my lady hawats orders which young lady one of the escort wenches you understand my lady he glanced at mapes lowered his voice theyre always calling on idaho for special surveillance of the ladies and jessica thought so they are but why is he drunk she frowned turned to mapes mapes bring a stimulant id suggest caffeine perhaps theres some of the spice coffee left mapes shrugged headed for the kitchen her unlaced desert boots slapslapped against the stone floor idaho swung his unsteady head around to peer at an angle toward jessica killed moren three hunner men fr the duke he muttered whadduh wan na know is whym mere cant live unner th groun here cant live onna groun here wha kinna place is iss huh a sound from the side hall entry caught jessicas attention she turned saw yueh crossing to them his medical kit swinging in his left hand he was fully dressed looked pale exhausted the diamond tattoo stood out sharply on his forehead th good docker idaho shouted whadre you doc splint n pill man he turned blearily toward jessica makin uh damn fool uh mself huh jessica frowned remained silent wondering why would idaho get drunk was he drugged too much spice beer idaho said attempting to straighten mapes returned with a steaming cup in her hands stopped uncertainly behind yueh she looked at jessica who shook her head yueh put his kit on the floor nodded greeting to jessica said spice beer eh bes damn stuff ever tased idaho said he tried to pull himself to attention my sword was firs blooded on grumman killed a harkon harkon killed im fr th duke yueh turned looked at the cup in mapes hand what is that caffeine jessica said yueh took the cup held it toward idaho drink this lad dont wan any more f drink drink it i say idahos head wobbled toward yueh and he stumbled one step ahead dragging the guards with him im almighdy fed up with pleasin th mperial universe doc jus once were gon na do th thing my way after you drink this yueh said its just caffeine sprolly like all res uh this place damn sun stoo brighd nothin has uh righd color everthings wrong or well its nighttime now yueh said he spoke reasonably drink this like a good lad itll make you feel better don wan na feel bedder we cant argue with him all night jessica said and she thought this calls for shock treatment theres no reason for you to stay my lady yueh said i can take care of this jessica shook her head she stepped forward slapped idaho sharply across the cheek he stumbled back with his guards glaring at her this is no way to act in your dukes home she said she snatched the cup from yuehs hands spilling part of it thrust the cup toward idaho now drink this thats an order idaho jerked himself upright scowling down at her he spoke slowly with careful and precise enunciation i do not take orders from a damn harkonnen spy yueh stiffened whirled to face jessica her face had gone pale but she was nodding it all became clear to herthe broken stems of meaning she had seen in words and actions around her these past few days could now be translated she found herself in the grip of anger almost too great to contain it took the most profound of her bene gesserit training to quiet her pulse and smooth her breathing even then she could feel the blaze flickering they were always calling on idaho for surveillance of the ladies she shot a glance at yueh the doctor lowered his eyes you knew this she demanded i heard rumors my lady but i didnt want to add to your burdens hawat she snapped i want thufir hawat brought to me immediately but my lady immediately it has to be hawat she thought suspicion such as this could come from no other source without being discarded immediately idaho shook his head mumbled chuck th whole damn thing jessica looked down at the cup in her hand abruptly dashed its contents across idahos face lock him in one of the guest rooms of the east wing she ordered let him sleep it off the two guards stared at her unhappily one ventured perhaps we should take him someplace else mlady we could hes supposed to be here jessica snapped he has a job to do here her voice dripped bitterness hes so good at watching the ladies the guard swallowed do you know where the duke is she demanded hes at the command post my lady is hawat with him hawats in the city my lady you will bring hawat to me at once jessica said i will be in my sitting room when he arrives but my lady if necessary i will call the duke she said i hope it will not be necessary i would not want to disturb him with this yes my lady jessica thrust the empty cup into mapes hands met the questioning stare of the bluewithinblue eyes you may return to bed mapes youre sure youll not need me jessica smiled grimly im sure perhaps this could wait until tomorrow yueh said i could give you a sedative and you will return to your quarters and leave me to handle this my way she said she patted his arm to take the sting out of her command this is the only way abruptly head high she turned and stalked off through the house to her rooms cold walls passages a familiar door she jerked the door open strode in and slammed it behind her jessica stood there glaring at the shieldblanked windows of her sitting room hawat could he be the one the harkonnens bought we shall see jessica crossed to the deep oldfashioned armchair with an embroidered cover of schlag skin moved the chair into position to command the door she was suddenly very conscious of the crysknife in its sheath on her leg she removed the sheath and strapped it to her arm tested the drop of it once more she glanced around the room placing everything precisely in her mind against any emergency the chaise near the corner the straight chairs along the wall the two low tables her standmounted zither beside the door to her bedroom pale rose light glowed from the suspensor lamps she dimmed them sat down in the armchair patting the upholstery appreciating the chairs regal heaviness for this occasion now let him come she thought we shall see what we shall see and she prepared herself in the bene gesserit fashion for the wait accumulating patience saving her strength sooner than she had expected a rap sounded at the door and hawat entered at her command she watched him without moving from the chair seeing the crackling sense of druginduced energy in his movements seeing the fatigue beneath hawats rheumy old eyes glittered his leathery skin appeared faintly yellow in the rooms light and there was a wide wet stain on the sleeve of his knife arm she smelled blood there jessica gestured to one of the straightbacked chairs said bring that chair and sit facing me hawat bowed obeyed that drunken fool of an idaho he thought he studied jessicas face wondering how he could save this situation its long past time to clear the air between us jessica said what troubles my lady he sat down placed hands on knees dont play coy with me she snapped if yueh didnt tell you why i summoned you then one of your spies in my household did shall we be at least that honest with each other as you wish my lady first you will answer me one question she said are you now a harkonnen agent hawat surged half out of his chair his face dark with fury demanding you dare insult me so sit down she said you insulted me so slowly he sank back into the chair and jessica reading the signs of this face that she knew so well allowed herself a deep breath it isnt hawat now i know you remain loyal to my duke she said im prepared therefore to forgive your affront to me is there something to forgive jessica scowled wondering shall i play my trump shall i tell him of the dukes daughter ive carried within me these few weeks no leto himself doesnt know this would only complicate his life divert him in a time when he must concentrate on our survival there is yet time to use this a truthsayer would solve this she said but we have no truthsayer qualified by the high board as you say weve no truthsayer is there a traitor among us she asked ive studied our people with great care who could it be not gurney certainly not duncan their lieutenants are not strategically enough placed to consider its not you thufir it can not be paul i know its not me dr yueh then shall i call him in and put him to the test you know thats an empty gesture hawat said hes conditioned by the high college that i know for certain not to mention that his wife was a bene gesserit slain by the harkonnens jessica said so thats what happened to her hawat said havent you heard the hate in his voice when he speaks the harkonnen name you know i dont have the ear hawat said what brought this base suspicion on me she asked hawat frowned my lady puts her servant in an impossible position my first loyalty is to the duke im prepared to forgive much because of that loyalty she said and again i must ask is there something to forgive stalemate she asked he shrugged let us discuss something else for a minute then she said duncan idaho the admirable fighting man whose abilities at guarding and surveillance are so esteemed tonight he overindulged in something called spice beer i hear reports that others among our people have been stupefied by this concoction is that true you have your reports my lady so i do dont you see this drinking as a symptom thufir my lady speaks riddles apply your mentat abilities to it she snapped whats the problem with duncan and the others i can tell you in four wordsthey have no home he jabbed a finger at the floor arrakis thats their home arrakis is an unknown caladan was their home but weve uprooted them they have no home and they fear the dukes failing them he stiffened such talk from one of the men would be cause for oh stop that thufir is it defeatist or treacherous for a doctor to diagnose a disease correctly my only intention is to cure the disease the duke gives me charge over such matters but you understand i have a certain natural concern over the progress of this disease she said and perhaps youll grant i have certain abilities along these lines will i have to shock him severely she wondered he needs shaking upsomething to break him from routine there could be many interpretations for your concern hawat said he shrugged then youve already convicted me of course not my lady but i can not afford to take any chances the situation being what it is a threat to my son got past you right here in this house she said who took that chance his face darkened i offered my resignation to the duke did you offer your resignation to me or to paul now he was openly angry betraying it in quickness of breathing in dilation of nostrils a steady stare she saw a pulse beating at his temple im the dukes man he said biting off the words there is no traitor she said the threats something else perhaps it has to do with the lasguns perhaps theyll risk secreting a few lasguns with timing mechanisms aimed at house shields perhaps theyll and who could tell after the blast if the explosion wasnt atomic he asked no my lady theyll not risk anything that illegal radiation lingers the evidence is hard to erase no theyll observe most of the forms it has to be a traitor youre the dukes man she sneered would you destroy him in the effort to save him he took a deep breath then if youre innocent youll have my most abject apologies look at you now thufir she said humans live best when each has his own place when each knows where he belongs in the scheme of things destroy the place and destroy the person you and i thufir of all those who love the duke are most ideally situated to destroy the others place could i not whisper suspicions about you into the dukes ear at night when would he be most susceptible to such whispering thufir must i draw it for you more clearly you threaten me he growled indeed not i merely point out to you that someone is attacking us through the basic arrangement of our lives its clever diabolical i propose to negate this attack by so ordering our lives that therell be no chinks for such barbs to enter you accuse me of whispering baseless suspicions baseless yes youd meet this with your own whispers your life is compounded of whispers not mine thufir then you question my abilities she sighed thufir i want you to examine your own emotional involvement in this the natural humans an animal without logic your projections of logic onto all affairs is unnatural but suffered to continue for its usefulness youre the embodiment of logica mentat yet your problem solutions are concepts that in a very real sense are projected outside yourself there to be studied and rolled around examined from all sides you think now to teach me my trade he asked and he did not try to hide the disdain in his voice anything outside yourself this you can see and apply your logic to it she said but its a human trait that when we encounter personal problems those things most deeply personal are the most difficult to bring out for our logic to scan we tend to flounder around blaming everything but the actual deepseated thing thats really chewing on us youre deliberately attempting to undermine my faith in my abilities as a mentat he rasped were i to find one of our people attempting thus to sabotage any other weapon in our arsenal i should not hesitate to denounce and destroy him the finest mentats have a healthy respect for the error factor in their computations she said ive never said otherwise then apply yourself to these symptoms weve both seen drunkenness among the men quarrelsthey gossip and exchange wild rumors about arrakis they ignore the most simple idleness no more he said dont try to divert my attention by trying to make a simple matter appear mysterious she stared at him thinking of the dukes men rubbing their woes together in the barracks until you could almost smell the charge there like burnt insulation theyre becoming like the men of the preguild legend she thought like the men of the lost starsearcher ampolirossick at their gunsforever seeking forever prepared and forever unready why have you never made full use of my abilities in your service to the duke she asked do you fear a rival for your position he glared at her the old eyes blazing i know some of the training they give you bene gesserit he broke off scowling go ahead say it she said bene gesserit witches i know something of the real training they give you he said ive seen it come out in paul im not fooled by what your schools tell the public you exist only to serve the shock must be severe and hes almost ready for it she thought you listen respectfully to me in council she said yet you seldom heed my advice why i dont trust your bene gesserit motives he said you may think you can look through a man you may think you can make a man do exactly what you you poor fool thufir she raged he scowled pushing himself back in the chair whatever rumors youve heard about our schools she said the truth is far greater if i wished to destroy the duke or you or any other person within my reach you could not stop me and she thought why do i let pride drive such words out of me this is not the way i was trained this is not how i must shock him hawat slipped a hand beneath his tunic where he kept a tiny projector of poison darts she wears no shield he thought is this just a brag she makes i could slay her now but ahhhh the consequences if im wrong jessica saw the gesture toward his pocket said let us pray violence shall never be necessary between us a worthy prayer he agreed meanwhile the sickness spreads among us she said i must ask you again isnt it more reasonable to suppose the harkonnens have planted this suspicion to pit the two of us against each other we appear tove returned to stalemate he said she sighed thinking hes almost ready for it the duke and i are father and mother surrogates to our people she said the position he hasnt married you hawat said she forced herself to calmness thinking a good riposte that but hell not marry anyone else she said not as long as i live and we are surrogates as ive said to break up this natural order in our affairs to disturb disrupt and confuse uswhich target offers itself most enticingly to the harkonnens he sensed the direction she was taking and his brows drew down in a lowering scowl the duke she asked attractive target yes but no one with the possible exception of paul is better guarded me i tempt them surely but they must know the bene gesserit make difficult targets and theres a better target one whose duties create necessarily a monstrous blind spot one to whom suspicion is as natural as breathing one who builds his entire life on innuendo and mystery she darted her right hand toward him you hawat started to leap from his chair i have not dismissed you thufir she flared the old mentat almost fell back into the chair so quickly did his muscles betray him she smiled without mirth now you know something of the real training they give us she said hawat tried to swallow in a dry throat her command had been regal preemptoryuttered in a tone and manner he had found completely irresistible his body had obeyed her before he could think about it nothing could have prevented his responsenot logic not passionate anger nothing to do what she had done spoke of a sensitive intimate knowledge of the person thus commanded a depth of control he had not dreamed possible i have said to you before that we should understand each other she said i meant you should understand me i already understand you and i tell you now that your loyalty to the duke is all that guarantees your safety with me he stared at her wet his lips with his tongue if i desired a puppet the duke would marry me she said he might even think he did it of his own free will hawat lowered his head looked upward through his sparse lashes only the most rigid control kept him from calling the guard control and the suspicion now that woman might not permit it his skin crawled with the memory of how she had controlled him in the moment of hesitation she could have drawn a weapon and killed him does every human have this blind spot he wondered can any of us be ordered into action before he can resist the idea staggered him who could stop a person with such power youve glimpsed the fist within the bene gesserit glove she said few glimpse it and live and what i did was a relatively simple thing for us youve not seen my entire arsenal think on that why arent you out destroying the dukes enemies he asked what would you have me destroy she asked would you have me make a weakling of our duke have him forever leaning on me but with such power powers a twoedged sword thufir she said you think how easy for her to shape a human tool to thrust into an enemys vitals true thufir even into your vitals yet what would i accomplish if enough of us bene gesserit did this wouldnt it make all bene gesserit suspect we dont want that thufir we do not wish to destroy ourselves she nodded we truly exist only to serve i can not answer you he said you know i can not answer youll say nothing about what has happened here to anyone she said i know you thufir my lady again the old man tried to swallow in a dry throat and he thought she has great powers yes but would these not make her an even more formidable tool for the harkonnens the duke could be destroyed as quickly by his friends as by his enemies she said i trust now youll get to the bottom of this suspicion and remove it if it proves baseless he said if she sneered if he said you are tenacious she said cautious he said and aware of the error factor then ill pose another question for you what does it mean to you that you stand before another human that you are bound and helpless and the other human holds a knife at your throatyet this other human refrains from killing you frees you from your bonds and gives you the knife to use as you will she lifted herself out of the chair turned her back on him you may go now thufir the old mentat arose hesitated hand creeping toward the deadly weapon beneath his tunic he was reminded of the bull ring and of the dukes father whod been brave no matter what his other failings and one day of the corrida long ago the fierce black beast had stood there head bowed immobilized and confused the old duke had turned his back on the horns cape thrown flamboyantly over one arm while cheers rained down from the stands i am the bull and she the matador hawat thought he withdrew his hand from the weapon glanced at the sweat glistening in his empty palm and he knew that whatever the facts proved to be in the end he would never forget this moment nor lose this sense of supreme admiration for the lady jessica quietly he turned and left the room jessica lowered her gaze from the reflection in the windows turned and stared at the closed door now well see some proper action she whispered do you wrestle with dreams do you contend with shadows do you move in a kind of sleep time has slipped away your life is stolen you tarried with trifles victim of your folly dirge for jamis on the funeral plain from songs of muaddib by the princess irulan leto stood in the foyer of his house studying a note by the light of a single suspensor lamp dawn was yet a few hours away and he felt his tiredness a fremen messenger had brought the note to the outer guard just now as the duke arrived from his command post the note read a column of smoke by day a pillar of fire by night there was no signature what does it mean he wondered the messenger had gone without waiting for an answer and before he could be questioned he had slipped into the night like some smoky shadow leto pushed the paper into a tunic pocket thinking to show it to hawat later he brushed a lock of hair from his forehead took a sighing breath the antifatigue pills were beginning to wear thin it had been a long two days since the dinner party and longer than that since he had slept on top of all the military problems thered been the disquieting session with hawat the report on his meeting with jessica should i waken jessica he wondered theres no reason to play the secrecy game with her any longer or is there blast and damn that duncan idaho he shook his head no not duncan i was wrong not to take jessica into my confidence from the first i must do it now before more damage is done the decision made him feel better and he hurried from the foyer through the great hall and down the passages toward the family wing at the turn where the passages split to the service area he paused a strange mewling came from somewhere down the service passage leto put his left hand to the switch on his shield belt slipped his kindjal into his right hand the knife conveyed a sense of reassurance that strange sound had sent a chill through him softly the duke moved down the service passage cursing the inadequate illumination the smallest of suspensors had been spaced about eight meters apart along here and tuned to their dimmest level the dark stone walls swallowed the light a dull blob stretching across the floor appeared out of the gloom ahead leto hesitated almost activated his shield but refrained because that would limit his movements his hearing and because the captured shipment of lasguns had left him filled with doubts silently he moved toward the grey blob saw that it was a human figure a man face down on the stone leto turned him over with a foot knife poised bent close in the dim light to see the face it was the smuggler tuek a wet stain down his chest the dead eyes stared with empty darkness leto touched the stainwarm how could this man be dead here leto asked himself who killed him the mewling sound was louder here it came from ahead and down the side passage to the central room where they had installed the main shield generator for the house hand on belt switch kindjal poised the duke skirted the body slipped down the passage and peered around the corner toward the shield generator room another grey blob lay stretched on the floor a few paces away and he saw at once this was the source of the noise the shape crawled toward him with painful slowness gasping mumbling leto stilled his sudden constriction of fear darted down the passage crouched beside the crawling figure it was mapes the fremen housekeeper her hair tumbled around her face clothing disarrayed a dull shininess of dark stain spread from her back along her side he touched her shoulder and she lifted herself on her elbows head tipped up to peer at him the eyes blackshadowed emptiness syou she gasped killed guard sent get tuek escape mlady you you here no she flopped forward her head thumping against the stone leto felt for pulse at the temples there was none he looked at the stain shed been stabbed in the back who his mind raced did she mean someone had killed a guard and tuekhad jessica sent for him why he started to stand up a sixth sense warned him he flashed a hand toward the shield switchtoo late a numbing shock slammed his arm aside he felt pain there saw a dart protruding from the sleeve sensed paralysis spreading from it up his arm it took an agonizing effort to lift his head and look down the passage yueh stood in the open door of the generator room his face reflected yellow from the light of a single brighter suspensor above the door there was stillness from the room behind himno sound of generators yueh leto thought hes sabotaged the house generators we re wide open yueh began walking toward him pocketing a dartgun leto found he could still speak gasped yueh how then the paralysis reached his legs and he slid to the floor with his back propped against the stone wall yuehs face carried a look of sadness as he bent over touched letos forehead the duke found he could feel the touch but it was remote dull the drug on the dart is selective yueh said you can speak but id advise against it he glanced down the hall and again bent over leto pulled out the dart tossed it aside the sound of the dart clattering on the stones was faint and distant to the dukes ears it cant be yueh leto thought hes conditioned how leto whispered im sorry my dear duke but there are things which will make greater demands than this he touched the diamond tattoo on his forehead i find it very strange myselfan override on my pyretic consciencebut i wish to kill a man yes i actually wish it i will stop at nothing to do it he looked down at the duke oh not you my dear duke the baron harkonnen i wish to kill the baron bar on har be quiet please my poor duke you havent much time that peg tooth i put in your mouth after the tumble at narcalthat tooth must be replaced in a moment ill render you unconscious and replace that tooth he opened his hand stared at something in it an exact duplicate its core shaped most exquisitely like a nerve itll escape the usual detectors even a fast scanning but if you bite down hard on it the cover crushes then when you expel your breath sharply you fill the air around you with a poison gasmost deadly leto stared up at yueh seeing madness in the mans eyes the perspiration along brown and chin you were dead anyway my poor duke yueh said but you will get close to the baron before you die hell believe youre stupefied by drugs beyond any dying effort to attack him and you will be druggedand tied but attack can take strange forms and you will remember the tooth the tooth duke leto atreides you will remember the tooth the old doctor leaned closer and closer until his face and drooping mustache dominated letos narrowing vision the tooth yueh muttered why leto whispered yueh lowered himself to one knee beside the duke i made a shaitans bargain with the baron and i must be certain he has fulfilled his half of it when i see him ill know when i look at the baron then i will know but ill never enter his presence without the price youre the price my poor duke and ill know when i see him my poor wan na taught me many things and one is to see certainty of truth when the stress is great i can not do it always but when i see the baronthen i will know leto tried to look down at the tooth in yuehs hand he felt this was happening in a nightmareit could not be yuehs purple lips turned up in a grimace ill not get close enough to the baron or id do this myself no ill be detained at a safe distance but you ah now you my lovely weapon hell want you close to himto gloat over you to boast a little leto found himself almost hypnotized by a muscle on the left side of yuehs jaw the muscle twisted when the man spoke yueh leaned closer and you my good duke my precious duke you must remember this tooth he held it up between thumb and forefinger it will be all that remains to you letos mouth moved without sound then refuse ahh no you mustnt refuse because in return for this small service im doing a thing for you i will save your son and your woman no other can do it they can be removed to a place where no harkonnen can reach them how save them leto whispered by making it appear theyre dead by secreting them among people who draw knife at hearing the harkonnen name who hate the harkonnens so much theyll burn a chair in which a harkonnen has sat salt the ground over which a harkonnen has walked he touched letos jaw can you feel anything in your jaw the duke found that he could not answer he sensed distant tugging saw yuehs hand come up with the ducal signet ring for paul yueh said youll be unconscious presently goodby my poor duke when next we meet well have no time for conversation cool remoteness spread upward from letos jaw across his cheeks the shadowy hall narrowed to a pinpoint with yuehs purple lips centered in it remember the tooth yueh hissed the tooth there should be a science of discontent people need hard times and oppression to develop psychic muscles from collected sayings of muaddib by the princess irulan jessica awoke in the dark feeling premonition in the stillness around her she could not understand why her mind and body felt so sluggish skin raspings of fear ran along her nerves she thought of sitting up and turning on a light but something stayed the decision her mouth felt strange lumplumplumplump it was a dull sound directionless in the dark somewhere the waiting moment was packed with time with rustling needlestick movements she began to feel her body grew aware of bindings on wrists and ankles a gag in her mouth she was on her side hands tied behind her she tested the bindings realized they were krimskell fiber would only claw tighter as she pulled and now she remembered there had been movement in the darkness of her bedroom something wet and pungent slapped against her face filling her mouth hands grasping for her she had gaspedone indrawn breathsensing the narcotic in the wetness consciousness had receded sinking her into a black bin of terror it has come she thought how simple it was to subdue the bene gesserit all it took was treachery hawat was right she forced herself not to pull on her bindings this is not my bedroom she thought theyve taken me someplace else slowly she marshaled the inner calmness she grew aware of the smell of her own stale sweat with its chemical infusion of fear where is paul she asked herself my sonwhat have they done to him calmness she forced herself to it using the ancient routines but terror remained so near leto where are you leto she sensed a diminishing in the dark it began with shadows dimensions separated became new thorns of awareness white a line under a door im on the floor people walking she sensed it through the floor jessica squeezed back the memory of terror i must remain calm alert and prepared i may get only one chance again she forced the inner calmness the ungainly thumping of her heartbeats evened shaping out time she counted back i was unconscious about an hour she closed her eyes focused her awareness onto the approaching footsteps four people she counted the differences in their steps i must pretend im still unconscious she relaxed against the cold floor testing her bodys readiness heard a door open sensed increased light through her eyelids feet approached someone standing over her you are awake rumbled a basso voice do not pretend she opened her eyes the baron vladimir harkonnen stood over her around them she recognized the cellar room where paul had slept saw his cot at one sideempty suspensor lamps were brought in by guards distributed near the open door there was a glare of light in the hallway beyond that hurt her eyes she looked up at the baron he wore a yellow cape that bulged over his portable suspensors the fat cheeks were two cherubic mounds beneath spiderblack eyes the drug was timed he rumbled we knew to the minute when youd be coming out of it how could that be she wondered they d have to know my exact weight my metabolism my yueh such a pity you must remain gagged the baron said we could have such an interesting conversation yuehs the only one it could be she thought how the baron glanced behind him at the door come in piter she had never before seen the man who entered to stand beside the baron but the face was knownand the man piter de vries the mentatassassin she studied himhawk features blueink eyes that suggested he was a native of arrakis but subtleties of movement and stance told her he was not and his flesh was too well firmed with water he was tall though slender and something about him suggested effeminacy such a pity we can not have our conversation my dear lady jessica the baron said however im aware of your abilities he glanced at the mentat isnt that true piter as you say baron the man said the voice was tenor it touched her spine with a wash of coldness she had never heard such a chill voice to one with the bene gesserit training the voice screamed killer i have a surprise for piter the baron said he thinks he has come here to collect his rewardyou lady jessica but i wish to demonstrate a thing that he does not really want you you play with me baron piter asked and he smiled seeing that smile jessica wondered that the baron did not leap to defend himself from this piter then she corrected herself the baron could not read that smile he did not have the training in many ways piter is quite naive the baron said he doesnt admit to himself what a deadly creature you are lady jessica id show him but itd be a foolish risk the baron smiled at piter whose face had become a waiting mask i know what piter really wants piter wants power you promised i could have her piter said the tenor voice had lost some of its cold reserve jessica heard the cluetones in the mans voice allowed herself an inward shudder how could the baron have made such an animal out of a mentat i give you a choice piter the baron said what choice the baron snapped fat fingers this woman and exile from the imperium or the duchy of atreides on arrakis to rule as you see fit in my name jessica watched the barons spider eyes study piter you could be duke here in all but name the baron said is my leto dead then jessica asked herself she felt a silent wail begin somewhere in her mind the baron kept his attention on the mentat understand yourself piter you want her because she was a dukes woman a symbol of his powerbeautiful useful exquisitely trained for her role but an entire duchy piter thats more than a symbol thats the reality with it you could have many women and more you do not joke with piter the baron turned with that dancing lightness the suspensors gave him joke i rememberi am giving up the boy you heard what the traitor said about the lads training they are alike this mother and sondeadly the baron smiled i must go now i will send in the guard ive reserved for this moment hes stone deaf his orders will be to convey you on the first leg of your journey into exile he will subdue this woman if he sees her gain control of you hell not permit you to untie her gag until youre off arrakis if you choose not to leave he has other orders you dont have to leave piter said ive chosen ah hah the baron chortled such quick decision can mean only one thing i will take the duchy piter said and jessica thought doesnt piter know the barons lying to him buthow could he know hes a twisted mentat the baron glanced down at jessica is it not wonderful that i know piter so well i wagered with my master at arms that this would be piters choice hah well i leave now this is much better ahh much better you understand lady jessica i hold no rancor toward you its a necessity much better this way yes and ive not actually ordered you destroyed when its asked of me what happened to you i can shrug it off in all truth you leave it to me then piter asked the guard i send you will take your orders the baron said whatevers done i leave to you he stared at piter yes there will be no blood on my hands here its your decision yes i know nothing of it you will wait until ive gone before doing whatever you must do yes well ah yes yes good he fears the questioning of a truthsayer jessica thought who ahhh the reverend mother gaius helen of course if he knows he must face her questions then the emperor is in on this for sure ahhhh my poor leto with one last glance at jessica the baron turned went out the door she followed him with her eyes thinking its as the reverend mother warnedtoo potent an adversary two harkonnen troopers entered another his face a scarred mask followed and stood in the doorway with drawn lasgun the deaf one jessica thought studying the scarred face the baron knows i could use the voice on any other man scarface looked at piter weve the boy on a litter outside what are your orders piter spoke to jessica id thought of binding you by a threat held over your son but i begin to see that would not have worked i let emotion cloud reason bad policy for a mentat he looked at the first pair of troopers turning so the deaf one could read his lips take them into the desert as the traitor suggested for the boy his plan is a good one the worms will destroy all evidence their bodies must never be found you dont wish to dispatch them yourself scarface asked he reads lips jessica thought i follow my barons example piter said take them where the traitor said jessica heard the harsh mentat control in piters voice thought he too fears the truthsayer piter shrugged turned and went through the doorway he hesitated there and jessica thought he might turn back for a last look at her but he went out without turning me i wouldnt like the thought of facing that truthsayer after this nights work scarface said you aint likely ever to run into that old witch one of the other troopers said he went around to jessicas head bent over her it aint getting our work done standing around here chattering take her feet and whynt we kill em here scarface asked too messy the first one said unless you wants to strangleem me i likes a nice straightforward job drop em on the desert like that traitor said cut em once or twice leave the evidence for the worms nothing to clean up afterwards yeah well i guess youre right scarface said jessica listened to them watching registering but the gag blocked her voice and there was the deaf one to consider scarface holstered his lasgun took her feet they lifted her like a sack of grain maneuvered her through the door and dumped her onto a suspensorbuoyed litter with another bound figure as they turned her fitting her to the litter she saw her companions facepaul he was bound but not gagged his face was no more than ten centimeters from hers eyes closed his breathing even is he drugged she wondered the troopers lifted the litter and pauls eyes opened the smallest fractiondark slits staring at her he mustnt try the voice she prayed the deaf guard pauls eyes closed he had been practicing the awarenessbreathing calming his mind listening to their captors the deaf one posed a problem but paul contained his despair the mindcalming bene gesserit regimen his mother had taught him kept him poised ready to expand any opportunity paul allowed himself another sliteyed inspection of his mothers face she appeared unharmed gagged though he wondered who couldve captured her his own captivity was plain enoughto bed with a capsule prescribed by yueh awaking to find himself bound to this litter perhaps a similar thing had befallen her logic said the traitor was yueh but he held final decision in abeyance there was no understanding ita suk doctor a traitor the litter tipped slightly as the harkonnen troopers maneuvered it through a doorway into starlit night a suspensorbuoy rasped against the doorway then they were on sand feet grating in it a thopter wing loomed overhead blotting the stars the litter settled to the ground pauls eyes adjusted to the faint light he recognized the deaf trooper as the man who opened the thopter door peered inside at the green gloom illuminated by the instrument panel this the thopter were supposed to use he asked and turned to watch his companions lips its the one the traitor said was fixed for desert work the other said scarface nodded but its one of them little liaison jobs aint room in there for moren them an two of us twos enough said the litterbearer moving up close and presenting his lips for reading we can take care of it from here on kinet the baron he told me to make sure what happened to them two scarface said what you so worried about asked another trooper from behind the litterbearer she is a bene gesserit witch the deaf one said they have powers ahhh the litterbearer made the sign of the fist at his ear one of them eh know whatcha mean the trooper behind him grunted shell be worm meat soon enough dont suppose even a bene gesserit witch has powers over one of them big worms eh czigo he nudged the litterbearer yeeup the litterbearer said he returned to the litter took jessicas shoulders cmon kinet you can go along if you wants to make sure what happens it is nice of you to invite me czigo scarface said jessica felt herself lifted the wing shadow spinningstars she was pushed into the rear of the thopter her krimskell fiber bindings examined and she was strapped down paul was jammed in beside her strapped securely and she noted his bonds were simple rope scarface the deaf one they called kinet took his place in front the litterbearer the one they called czigo came around and took the other front seat kinet closed his door bent to the controls the thopter took off in a wingtucked surge headed south over the shield wall czigo tapped his companions shoulder said whynt you turn around and keep an eye on them two sure you know the way to go kinet watched czigos lips i listened to the traitor sames you kinet swiveled his seat jessica saw the glint of starlight on a lasgun in his hand the thopters lightwalled interior seemed to collect illumination as her eyes adjusted but the guards scarred face remained dim jessica tested her seat belt found it loose she felt roughness in the strap against her left arm realized the strap had been almost severed would snap at a sudden jerk has someone been at this thopter preparing it for us she wondered who slowly she twisted her bound feet clear of pauls sure do seem a shame to waste a goodlooking woman like this scarface said you ever have any highborn types he turned to look at the pilot bene gesserit aint all highborn the pilot said but they all looks heighty he can see me plain enough jessica thought she brought her bound legs up onto the seat curled into a sinuous ball staring at scarface real pretty she is kinet said he wet his lips with his tongue sure do seem a shame he looked at czigo you thinking what i think youre thinking the pilot asked whod be to know the guard asked afterwards he shrugged i just never had me no highborns might never get a chance like this one again you lay a hand on my mother paul grated he glared at scarface hey the pilot laughed cubs got a bark aint got no bite though and jessica thought pauls pitching his voice too high it may work though they flew on in silence these poor fools jessica thought studying her guards and reviewing the barons words theyll be killed as soon as they report success on their mission the baron wants no witnesses the thopter banked over the southern rim of the shield wall and jessica saw a moonshadowed expanse of sand beneath them this oughta be far enough the pilot said the traitor said to putem on the sand anywhere near the shield wall he dipped the craft toward the dunes in a long falling stoop brought it up stiffly over the desert surface jessica saw paul begin taking the rhythmic breaths of the calming exercise he closed his eyes opened them jessica stared helpless to aid him he hasnt mastered the voice yet she thought if he fails the thopter touched sand with a soft lurch and jessica looking north back across the shield wall saw a shadow of wings settle out of sight up there someones following us she thought who then the ones the baron set to watch this pair and therell be watchers for the watchers too czigo shut off his wing rotors silence flooded in upon them jessica turned her head she could see out the window beyond scarface a dim glow of light from a rising moon a frosted rim of rock rising from the desert sandblast ridges streaked its sides paul cleared his throat the pilot said now kinet i dunno czigo czigo turned said ahhh look he reached out for jessicas skirt remove her gag paul commanded jessica felt the words rolling in the air the tone the timbre excellentimperative very sharp a slightly lower pitch would have been better but it could still fall within this mans spectrum czigo shifted his hand up to the band around jessicas mouth slipped the knot on the gag stop that kinet ordered ah shut your trap czigo said her handsre tied he freed the knot and the binding dropped his eyes glittered as he studied jessica kinet put a hand on the pilots arm look czigo no need to jessica twisted her neck spat out the gag she pitched her voice in low intimate tones gentlemen no need to fight over me at the same time she writhed sinuously for kinets benefit she saw them grow tense knowing that in this instant they were convinced of the need to fight over her their disagreement required no other reason in their minds they were fighting over her she held her face high in the instrument glow to be sure kinet would read her lips said you mustnt disagree they drew farther apart glanced warily at each other is any woman worth fighting over she asked by uttering the words by being there she made herself infinitely worth their fighting paul clamped his lips tightly closed forced himself to be silent there had been the one chance for him to succeed with the voice noweverything depended on his mother whose experience went so far beyond his own yeah scarface said no need to fight over his hand flashed toward the pilots neck the blow was met by a splash of metal that caught the arm and in the same motion slammed into kinets chest scarface groaned sagged backward against his door thought i was some dummy didnt know that trick czigo said he brought back his hand revealing the knife it glittered in reflected moonlight now for the cub he said and leaned toward paul no need for that jessica murmured czigo hesitated wouldnt you rather have me cooperative jessica asked give the boy a chance her lip curled in a sneer little enough chance hed have out there in that sand give him that and she smiled you could find yourself well rewarded czigo glanced left right returned his attention to jessica ive heard me what can happen to a man in this desert he said boy might find the knife a kindness is it so much i ask jessica pleaded youre trying to trick me czigo muttered i dont want to see my son die jessica said is that a trick czigo moved back elbowed the door latch he grabbed paul dragged him across the seat pushed him half out the door and held the knife posed whatll y do cub if i cut yr bonds hell leave here immediately and head for those rocks jessica said is that what yll do cub czigo asked pauls voice was properly surly yes the knife moved down slashed the bindings of his legs paul felt the hand on his back to hurl him down onto the sand feigned a lurch against the doorframe for purchase turned as though to catch himself lashed out with his right foot the toe was aimed with a precision that did credit to his long years of training as though all of that training focused on this instant almost every muscle of his body cooperated in the placement of it the tip struck the soft part of czigos abdomen just below the sternum slammed upward with terrible force over the liver and through the diaphragm to crush the right ventricle of the mans heart with one gurgling scream the guard jerked backward across the seats paul unable to use his hands continued his tumble onto the sand landing with a roll that took up the force and brought him back to his feet in one motion he dove back into the cabin found the knife and held it in his teeth while his mother sawed her bonds she took the blade and freed his hands i couldve handled him she said hed have had to cut my bindings that was a foolish risk i saw the opening and used it he said she heard the harsh control in his voice said yuehs house sign is scrawled on the ceiling of this cabin he looked up saw the curling symbol get out and let us study this craft she said theres a bundle under the pilots seat i felt it when we got in bomb doubt it theres something peculiar here paul leaped out to the sand and jessica followed she turned reached under the seat for the strange bundle seeing czigos feet close to her face feeling dampness on the bundle as she removed it realizing the dampness was the pilots blood waste of moisture she thought knowing that this was arrakeen thinking paul stared around them saw the rock scarp lifting out of the desert like a beach rising from the sea windcarved palisades beyond he turned back as his mother lifted the bundle from the thopter saw her stare across the dunes toward the shield wall he looked to see what drew her attention saw another thopter swooping toward them realized theyd not have time to clear the bodies out of this thopter and escape run paul jessica shouted its harkonnens arrakis teaches the attitude of the knifechopping off whats incomplete and saying now its complete because its ended here from collected sayings of muaddib by the princess irulan a man in harkonnen uniform skidded to a stop at the end of the hall stared in at yueh taking in at a single glance mapes body the sprawled form of the duke yueh standing there the man held a lasgun in his right hand there was a casual air of brutality about him a sense of toughness and poise that sent a shiver through yueh sardaukar yueh thought a bashar by the look of him probably one of the emperors own sent here to keep an eye on things no matter what the uniform theres no disguising them youre yueh the man said he looked speculatively at the suk school ring on the doctors hair stared once at the diamond tattoo and then met yuehs eyes i am yueh the doctor said you can relax yueh the man said when you dropped the house shields we came right in everythings under control here is this the duke this is the duke dead merely unconscious i suggest you tie him did you do for these others he glanced back down the hall where mapes body lay mores the pity yueh muttered pity the sardaukar sneered he advanced looked down at leto so thats the great red duke if i had doubts about what this man is that would end them yueh thought only the emperor calls the atreides the red duke the sardaukar reached down cut the red hawk insignia from letos uniform little souvenir he said wheres the ducal signet ring he doesnt have it on him yueh said i can see that the sardaukar snapped yueh stiffened swallowed if they press me bring in a truthsayer theyll find out about the ring about the thopter i preparedall will fail sometimes the duke sent the ring with a messenger as surety that an order came directly from him yueh said must be damned trusted messengers the sardaukar muttered arent you going to tie him yueh ventured how longll he be unconscious two hours or so i wasnt as precise with his dosage as i was for the woman and boy the sardaukar spurned the duke with his toe this was nothing to fear even when awake when will the woman and boy awaken about ten minutes so soon i was told the baron would arrive immediately behind his men so he will youll wait outside yueh he shot a hard glance at yueh now yueh glanced at leto what about hell be delivered to the baron all properly trussed like a roast for the oven again the sardaukar looked at the diamond tattoo on yuehs forehead youre known youll be safe enough in the halls weve no more time for chitchat traitor i hear the others coming traitor yueh thought he lowered his gaze pressed past the sardaukar knowing this as a foretaste of how history would remember him yueh the traitor he passed more bodies on his way to the front entrance and glanced at them fearful that one might be paul or jessica all were house troopers or wore harkonnen uniform harkonnen guards came alert staring at him as he emerged from the front entrance into flamelighted night the palms along the road had been fired to illuminate the house black smoke from the flammables used to ignite the trees poured upward through orange flames its the traitor someone said the baron will want to see you soon another said i must get to the thopter yueh thought i must put the ducal signet where paul will find it and fear struck him if idaho suspects me or grows impatientif he doesnt wait and go exactly where i told himjessica and paul will not be saved from the carnage ill be denied even the smallest relief from my act the harkonnen guard released his arm said wait over there out of the way abruptly yueh saw himself as cast away in this place of destruction spared nothing given not the smallest pity idaho must not fail another guard bumped into him barked stay out of the way you even when theyve profited by me they despise me yueh thought he straightened himself as he was pushed aside regained some of his dignity wait for the baron a guard officer snarled yueh nodded walked with controlled casualness along the front of the house turned the corner into shadows out of sight of the burning palms quickly every step betraying his anxiety yueh made for the rear yard beneath the conservatory where the thopter waitedthe craft they had placed there to carry away paul and his mother a guard stood at the open rear door of the house his attention focused on the lighted hall and men banging through there searching from room to room how confident they were yueh hugged the shadows worked his way around the thopter eased open the door on the side away from the guard he felt under the front seats for the fremkit he had hidden there lifted a flap and slipped in the ducal signet he felt the crinkling of the spice paper there the note he had written pressed the ring into the paper he removed his hand resealed the pack softly yueh closed the thopter door worked his way back to the corner of the house and around toward the flaming trees now it is done he thought once more he emerged into the light of the blazing palms he pulled his cloak around him stared at the flames soon i will know soon i will see the baron and i will know and the baronhe will encounter a small tooth there is a legend that the instant the duke leto atreides died a meteor streaked across the skies above his ancestral palace on caladan the princess irulan introduction to a childs history of muaddib the baron vladimir harkonnen stood at a viewport of the grounded lighter he was using as a command post out the port he saw the flamelighted night of arrakeen his attention focused on the distant shield wall where his secret weapon was doing its work explosive artillery the guns nibbled at the caves where the dukes fighting men had retreated for a lastditch stand slowly measured bites of orange glare showers of rock and dust in the brief illuminationand the dukes men were being sealed off to die by starvation caught like animals in their burrows the baron could feel the distant chompinga drumbeat carried to him through the ships metal broomp broomp then broompbroomp who would think of reviving artillery in this day of shields the thought was a chuckle in his mind but it was predictable the dukes men would run for those caves and the emperor will appreciate my cleverness in preserving the lives of our mutual force he adjusted one of the little suspensors that guarded his fat body against the pull of gravity a smile creased his mouth pulled at the lines of his jowls a pity to waste such fighting men as the dukes he thought he smiled more broadly laughing at himself pity should be cruel he nodded failure was by definition expendable the whole universe sat there open to the man who could make the right decisions the uncertain rabbits had to be exposed made to run for their burrows else how could you control them and breed them he pictured his fighting men as bees routing the rabbits and he thought the day hums sweetly when you have enough bees working for you a door opened behind him the baron studied the reflection in the nightblackened viewport before turning piter de vries advanced into the chamber followed by umman kudu the captain of the barons personal guard there was a motion of men just outside the door the mutton faces of his guard their expressions carefully sheeplike in his presence the baron turned piter touched finger to forelock in his mocking salute good news mlord the sardaukar have brought in the duke of course they have the baron rumbled he studied the somber mask of villainy on piters effeminate face and the eyes those shaded slits of bluest blueinblue soon i mast remove him the baron thought he has almost outlasted his usefulness almost reached the point of positive danger to my person first though he must make the people of arrakis hate him thenthey will welcome my darling feydrautha as a savior the baron shifted his attention to the guard captainumman kudu scissorsline of jaw muscles chin like a boot toea man to be trusted because the captains vices were known first where is the traitor who gave me the duke the baron asked i must give the traitor his reward piter turned on one toe motioned to the guard outside a bit of black movement there and yueh walked through his motions were stiff and stringy the mustache drooped beside his purple lips only the old eyes seemed alive yueh came to a stop three paces into the room obeying a motion from piter and stood there staring across the open space at the baron ahhh dr yueh mlord harkonnen youve given us the duke i hear my half of the bargain mlord the baron looked at piter piter nodded the baron looked back at yueh the letter of the bargain eh and i he spat the words out what was i to do in return you remember quite well mlord harkonnen and yueh allowed himself to think now hearing the loud silence of clocks in his mind he had seen the subtle betrayals in the barons manner wan na was indeed deadgone far beyond their reach otherwise thered still be a hold on the weak doctor the barons manner showed there was no hold it was ended do i the baron asked you promised to deliver my wan na from her agony the baron nodded oh yes now i remember so i did that was my promise that was how we bent the imperial conditioning you couldnt endure seeing your bene gesserit witch grovel in piters pain amplifiers well the baron vladimir harkonnen always keeps his promises i told you id free her from the agony and permit you to join her so be it he waved a hand at piter piters blue eyes took a glazed look his movement was catlike in its sudden fluidity the knife in his hand glistened like a claw as it flashed into yuehs back the old man stiffened never taking his attention from the baron so join her the baron spat yueh stood swaying his lips moved with careful precision and his voice came in oddly measured cadence you think you de feated me you think i did not know what i bought for my wan na he toppled no bending or softening it was like a tree falling so join her the baron repeated but his words were like a weak echo yueh had filled him with a sense of foreboding he whipped his attention to piter watched the man wipe the blade on a scrap of cloth watched the creamy look of satisfaction in the blue eyes so thats how he kills by his own hand the baron thought its well to know he did give us the duke the baron asked of a certainty my lord piter said then get him in here piter glanced at the guard captain who whirled to obey the baron looked down at yueh from the way the man had fallen you could suspect oak in him instead of bones i never could bring myself to trust a traitor the baron said not even a traitor i created he glanced at the nightshrouded viewport that black bag of stillness out there was his the baron knew there was no more crump of artillery against the shield wall caves the burrow traps were sealed off quite suddenly the barons mind could conceive of nothing more beautiful than that utter emptiness of black unless it were white on the black plated white on the black porcelain white but there was still the feeling of doubt what had the old fool of a doctor meant of course hed probably known what would happen to him in the end but that bit about thinking hed been defeated you think you defeated me what had he meant the duke leto atreides came through the door his arms were bound in chains the eagle face streaked with dirt his uniform was torn where someone had ripped off his insignia there were tatters at his waist where the shield belt had been removed without first freeing the uniform ties the dukes eyes held a glazed insane look wellll the baron said he hesitated drawing in a deep breath he knew he had spoken too loudly this moment long envisioned had lost some of its savor damn that cursed doctor through all eternity i believe the good duke is drugged piter said thats how yueh caught him for us piter turned to the duke arent you drugged my dear duke the voice was far away leto could feel the chains the ache of muscles his cracked lips his burning cheeks the dry taste of thirst whispering its grit in his mouth but sounds were dull hidden by a cottony blanket and he saw only dim shapes through the blanket what of the woman and the boy piter the baron asked any word yet piters tongue darted over his lips youve heard something the baron snapped what piter glanced at the guard captain back to the baron the men who were sent to do the job mlordtheyve ah been ah found well they report everything satisfactory theyre dead mlord of course they are what i want to know is they were dead when found mlord the barons face went livid and the woman and boy no sign mlord but there was a worm it came while the scene was being investigated perhaps its as we wishedan accident possibly we do not deal in possibilities piter what of the missing thopter does that suggest anything to my mentat one of the dukes men obviously escaped in it mlord killed our pilot and escaped which of the dukes men it was a clean silent killing mlord hawat perhaps or that halleck one possibly idaho or any top lieutenant possibilities the baron muttered he glanced at the swaying drugged figure of the duke the situation is in hand mlord piter said no it isnt where is that stupid planetologist where is this man kynes weve word where to find him and hes been sent for mlord i dont like the way the emperors servant is helping us the baron muttered they were words through a cottony blanket but some of them burned in letos mind woman and boyno sign paul and jessica had escaped and the fate of hawat halleck and idaho remained an unknown there was still hope where is the ducal signet ring the baron demanded his finger is bare the sardaukar say it was not on him when he was taken my lord the guard captain said you killed the doctor too soon the baron said that was a mistake you shouldve warned me piter you moved too precipitately for the good of our enterprise he scowled possibilities the thought hung like a sine wave in letos mind paul and jessica have escaped and there was something else in his memory a bargain he could almost remember it the tooth he remembered part of it now a pill of poison gas shaped into a false tooth someone had told him to remember the tooth the tooth was in his mouth he could feel its shape with his tongue all he had to do was bite sharply on it not yet the someone had told him to wait until he was near the baron who had told him he couldnt remember how long will he remain drugged like this the baron asked perhaps another hour mlord perhaps the baron muttered again he turned to the nightblackened window i am hungry thats the baron that fuzzy gray shape there leto thought the shape danced back and forth swaying with the movement of the room and the room expanded and contracted it grew brighter and darker it folded into blackness and faded time became a sequence of layers for the duke he drifted up through them i must wait there was a table leto saw the table quite clearly and a gross fat man on the other side of the table the remains of a meal in front of him leto felt himself sitting in a chair across from the fat man felt the chains the straps that held his tingling body in the chair he was aware there had been a passage of time but its length escaped him i believe hes coming around baron a silky voice that one that was piter so i see piter a rumbling basso the baron leto sensed increasing definition in his surroundings the chair beneath him took on firmness the bindings were sharper and he saw the baron clearly now leto watched the movements of the mans hands compulsive touchingsthe edge of a plate the handle of a spoon a finger tracing the fold of a jowl leto watched the moving hand fascinated by it you can hear me duke leto the baron said i know you can hear me we want to know from you where to find your concubine and the child you sired on her no sign escaped leto but the words were a wash of calmness through him its true then they dont have paul and jessica this is not a childs game we play the baron rumbled you must know that he leaned toward leto studying the face it pained the baron that this could not be handled privately just between the two of them to have others see royalty in such straitsit set a bad precedent leto could feel strength returning and now the memory of the false tooth stood out in his mind like a steeple in a flat landscape the nerveshaped capsule within that tooththe poison gashe remembered who had put the deadly weapon in his mouth yueh drugfogged memory of seeing a limp corpse dragged past him in this room hung like a vapor in letos mind he knew it had been yueh do you hear that noise duke leto the baron asked leto grew conscious of a frog sound the burred mewling of someones agony we caught one of your men disguised as a fremen the baron said we penetrated the disguise quite easily the eyes you know he insists he was sent among the fremen to spy on them ive lived for a time on this planet cher cousin one does not spy on those ragged scum of the desert tell me did you buy their help did you send your woman and son to them leto felt fear tighten his chest if yueh sent them to the desert fold the search wont stop until they re found come come the baron said we dont have much time and pain is quick please dont bring it to this my dear duke the baron looked up at piter who stood at letos shoulder piter doesnt have all his tools here but im sure he could improvise improvisation is sometimes the best baron that silky insinuating voice leto heard it at his ear you had an emergency plan the baron said where have your woman and the boy been sent he looked at letos hand your ring is missing does the boy have it the baron looked up stared into letos eyes you dont answer he said will you force me to do a thing i do not want to do piter will use simple direct methods i agree theyre sometimes the best but its not good that you should be subjected to such things hot tallow on the back perhaps or on the eyelids piter said perhaps on other portions of the body its especially effective when the subject doesnt know where the tallow will fall next its a good method and theres a sort of beauty in the pattern of puswhite blisters on naked skin eh baron exquisite the baron said and his voice sounded sour those touching fingers leto watched the fat hands the glittering jewels on babyfat handstheir compulsive wandering the sounds of agony coming through the door behind him gnawed at the dukes nerves who is it they caught he wondered could it have been idaho believe me cher cousin the baron said i do not want it to come to this you think of nerve couriers racing to summon help that can not come piter said theres an artistry in this you know youre a superb artist the baron growled now have the decency to be silent leto suddenly recalled a thing gurney halleck had said once seeing a picture of the baron and i stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea and upon his heads the name of blasphemy we waste time baron piter said perhaps the baron nodded you know my dear leto youll tell us in the end where they are theres a level of pain thatll buy you hes most likely correct leto thought were if not for the tooth and the fact that i truly dont know where they are the baron picked up a sliver of meat pressed the morsel into his mouth chewed slowly swallowed we must try a new tack he thought observe this prize person who denies hes for hire the baron said observe him piter and the baron thought yes see him there this man who believes he can not be bought see him detained there by a million shares of himself sold in dribbles every second of his life if you took him up now and shook him hed rattle inside emptied sold out what difference how he dies now the frog sounds in the background stopped the baron saw umman kudu the guard captain appear in the doorway across the room shake his head the captive hadnt produced the needed information another failure time to quit stalling with this fool duke this stupid soft fool who didnt realize how much hell there was so near himonly a nerves thickness away this thought calmed the baron overcoming his reluctance to have a royal person subject to pain he saw himself suddenly as a surgeon exercising endless supple scissor dissectionscutting away the masks from fools exposing the hell beneath rabbits all of them and how they cowered when they saw the carnivore leto stared across the table wondering why he waited the tooth would end it all quickly stillit had been good much of this life he found himself remembering an antenna kite updangling in the shellblue sky of caladan and paul laughing with joy at the sight of it and he remembered sunrise here on arrakiscolored strata of the shield wall mellowed by dust haze too bad the baron muttered he pushed himself back from the table stood up lightly in his suspensors and hesitated seeing a change come over the duke he saw the man draw in a deep breath the jawline stiffen the ripple of a muscle there as the duke clamped his mouth shut how he fears me the baron thought shocked by fear that the baron might escape him leto bit sharply on the capsule tooth felt it break he opened his mouth expelled the biting vapor he could taste as it formed on his tongue the baron grew smaller a figure seen in a tightening tunnel leto heard a gasp beside his earthe silkyvoiced one piter it got him too piter whats wrong the rumbling voice was far away leto sensed memories rolling in his mindthe old toothless mutterings of hags the room the table the baron a pair of terrified eyesblue within blue the eyesall compressed around him in ruined symmetry there was a man with a boottoe chin a toy man falling the toy man had a broken nose slanted to the left an offbeat metronome caught forever at the start of an upward stroke leto heard the crash of crockeryso distanta roaring in his ears his mind was a bin without end catching everything everything that had ever been every shout every whisper every silence one thought remained to him leto saw it in formless light on rays of black the day the flesh shapes and the flesh the day shapes the thought struck him with a sense of fullness he knew he could never explain silence the baron stood with his back against his private door his own bolt hole behind the table he had slammed it on a room full of dead men his senses took in guards swarming around him did i breathe it he asked himself whatever it was in there did it get me too sounds returned to him and reason he heard someone shouting ordersgas masks keep a door closed get blowers going the others fell quickly he thought im still standing im still breathing merciless hell that was close he could analyze it now his shield had been activated set low but still enough to slow molecular interchange across the field barrier and he had been pushing himself away from the table that and piters shocked gasp which had brought the guard captain darting forward into his own doom chance and the warning in a dying mans gaspthese had saved him the baron felt no gratitude to piter the fool had got himself killed and that stupid guard captain hed said he scoped everyone before bringing them into the barons presence how had it been possible for the duke no warning not even from the poison snooper over the tableuntil it was too late how well no matter now the baron thought his mind firming the next guard captain will begin by finding answers to these questions he grew aware of more activity down the hallaround the corner at the other door to that room of death the baron pushed himself away from his own door studied the lackeys around him they stood there staring silent waiting for the barons reaction would the baron be angry and the baron realized only a few seconds had passed since his flight from that terrible room some of the guards had weapons leveled at the door some were directing their ferocity toward the empty hall that stretched away toward the noises around the corner to their right a man came striding around that corner gas mask dangling by its straps at his neck his eyes intent on the overhead poison snoopers that lined this corridor he was yellowhaired flat of face with green eyes crisp lines radiated from his thicklipped mouth he looked like some water creature misplaced among those who walked the land the baron stared at the approaching man recalling the name nefud iakin nefud guard corporal nefud was addicted to semuta the drugmusic combination that played itself in the deepest consciousness a useful item of information that the man stopped in front of the baron saluted corridors clear mlord i was outside watching and saw that it must be poison gas ventilators in your room were pulling air in from these corridors he glanced up at the snooper over the barons head none of the stuff escaped we have the room cleaned out now what are your orders the baron recognized the mans voicethe one whod been shouting orders efficient this corporal he thought theyre all dead in there the baron asked yes mlord well we must adjust the baron thought first he said let me congratulate you nefud youre the new captain of my guard and i hope youll take to heart the lesson to be learned from the fate of your predecessor the baron watched the awareness grow in his newly promoted guardsman nefud knew hed never again be without his semuta nefud nodded my lord knows ill devote myself entirely to his safety yes well to business i suspect the duke had something in his mouth you will find out what that something was how it was used who helped him put it there youll take every precaution he broke off his chain of thought shattered by a disturbance in the corridor behind himguards at the door to the lift from the lower levels of the frigate trying to hold back a tall colonel bashar who had just emerged from the lift the baron couldnt place the colonel bashars face thin with mouth like a slash in leather twin ink spots for eyes get your hands off me you pack of carrioneaters the man roared and he dashed the guards aside ahhh one of the sardaukar the baron thought the colonel bashar came striding toward the baron whose eyes went to slits of apprehension the sardaukar officers filled him with unease they all seemed to look like relatives of the duke the late duke and their manners with the baron the colonel bashar planted himself half a pace in front of the baron hands on hips the guard hovered behind him in twitching uncertainty the baron noted the absence of salute the disdain in the sardaukars manner and his unease grew there was only the one legion of them locallyten brigadesreinforcing the harkonnen legions but the baron did not fool himself that one legion was perfectly capable of turning on the harkonnens and overcoming them tell your men they are not to prevent me from seeing you baron the sardaukar growled my men brought you the atreides duke before i could discuss his fate with you we will discuss it now i must not lose face before my men the baron thought so it was a coldly controlled word and the baron felt proud of it my emperor has charged me to make certain his royal cousin dies cleanly without agony the colonel bashar said such were the imperial orders to me the baron lied did you think id disobey im to report to my emperor what i see with my own eyes the sardaukar said the dukes already dead the baron snapped and he waved a hand to dismiss the fellow the colonel bashar remained planted facing the baron not by flicker of eye or muscle did he acknowledge he had been dismissed how he growled really the baron thought this is too much by his own hand if you must know the baron said he took poison i will see the body now the colonel bashar said the baron raised his gaze to the ceiling in feigned exasperation while his thoughts raced damnation this sharpeyed sardaukar will see the room before a things been changed now the sardaukar growled ill see it with my own eyes there was no preventing it the baron realized the sardaukar would see all hed know the duke had killed harkonnen men that the baron most likely had escaped by a narrow margin there was the evidence of the dinner remnants on the table and the dead duke across from it with destruction around him no preventing it at all ill not be put off the colonel bashar snarled youre not being put off the baron said and he stared into the sardaukars obsidian eyes i hide nothing from my emperor he nodded to nefud the colonel bashar is to see everything at once take him in by the door where you stood nefud this way sir nefud said slowly insolently the sardaukar moved around the baron shouldered a way through the guardsmen insufferable the baron thought now the emperor will know how i slipped up hell recognize it as a sign of weakness and it was agonizing to realize that the emperor and his sardaukar were alike in their disdain for weakness the baron chewed at his lower lip consoling himself that the emperor at least had not learned of the atreides raid on giedi prime the destruction of the harkonnen spice stores there damn that slippery duke the baron watched the retreating backsthe arrogant sardaukar and the stocky efficient nefud we must adjust the baron thought ill have to put rabban over this damnable planet once more without restraint i must spend my own harkonnen blood to put arrakis into a proper condition for accepting feydrautha damn that piter he would get himself killed before i was through with him the baron sighed and i must send at once to tleielax for a new mentat they undoubtedly have the new one ready for me by now one of the guardsmen beside him coughed the baron turned toward the man i am hungry yes mlord and i wish to be diverted while youre clearing out that room and studying its secrets for me the baron rumbled the guardsman lowered his eyes what diversion does mlord wish ill be in my sleeping chambers the baron said bring me that young fellow we bought on gamont the one with the lovely eyes drug him well i dont feel like wrestling yes mlord the baron turned away began moving with his bouncing suspensorbuoyed pace toward his chambers yes he thought the one with the lovely eyes the one who looks so much like the young paul atreides o seas of caladan o people of duke leto citadel of leto fallen fallen forever from songs of muaddib by the princess irulan paul felt that all his past every experience before this night had become sand curling in an hourglass he sat near his mother hugging his knees within a small fabric and plastic hutmenta stilltentthat had come like the fremen clothing they now wore from the pack left in the thopter there was no doubt in pauls mind who had put the fremkit there who had directed the course of the thopter carrying them captive yueh the traitor doctor had sent them directly into the hands of duncan idaho paul stared out the transparent end of the stilltent at the moonshadowed rocks that ringed this place where idaho had hidden them hiding like a child when im now the duke paul thought he felt the thought gall him but could not deny the wisdom in what they did something had happened to his awareness this nighthe saw with sharpened clarity every circumstance and occurrence around him he felt unable to stop the inflow of data or the cold precision with which each new item was added to his knowledge and the computation was centered in his awareness it was mentat power and more paul thought back to the moment of impotent rage as the strange thopter dived out of the night onto them stooping like a giant hawk above the desert with wind screaming through its wings the thing in pauls mind had happened then the thopter had skidded and slewed across a sand ridge toward the running figureshis mother and himself paul remembered how the smell of burned sulfur from abrasion of thopter skids against sand had drifted across them his mother he knew had turned expected to meet a lasgun in the hands of harkonnen mercenaries and had recognized duncan idaho leaning out the thopters open door shouting hurry theres wormsign south of you but paul had known as he turned who piloted the thopter an accumulation of minutiae in the way it was flown the dash of the landingclues so small even his mother hadnt detected themhad told paul precisely who sat at those controls across the stilltent from paul jessica stirred said there can be only one explanation the harkonnens held yuehs wife he hated the harkonnens i can not be wrong about that you read his note but why has he saved us from the carnage she is only now seeing it and that poorly paul thought the thought was a shock he had known this fact as a bytheway thing while reading the note that had accompanied the ducal signet in the pack do not try to forgive me yueh had written i do not want your forgiveness i already have enough burdens what i have done was done without malice or hope of anothers understanding it is my own tahaddi alburhan my ultimate test i give you the atreides ducal signet as token that i write truly by the time you read this duke leto will be dead take consolation from my assurance that he did not die alone that one we hate above all others died with him it had not been addressed or signed but there d been no mistaking the familiar scrawlyuehs remembering the letter paul reexperienced the distress of that momenta thing sharp and strange that seemed to happen outside his new mentat alertness he had read that his father was dead known the truth of the words but had felt them as no more than another datum to be entered in his mind and used i loved my father paul thought and knew this for truth i should mourn him i should feel something but he felt nothing except heres an important fact it was one with all the other facts all the while his mind was adding sense impressions extrapolating computing hallecks words came back to paul moods a thing for cattle or for making love you fight when the necessity arises no matter your mood perhaps thats it paul thought ill mourn my father later when theres time but he felt no letup in the cold precision of his being he sensed that his new awareness was only a beginning that it was growing the sense of terrible purpose hed first experienced in his ordeal with the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam pervaded him his right handthe hand of remembered paintingled and throbbed is this what it is to be their kwisatz haderach he wondered for a while i thought hawat had failed us again jessica said i thought perhaps yueh wasnt a suk doctor he was everything we thought him and more paul said and he thought why is she so slow seeing these things he said if idaho doesnt get through to kynes well be hes not our only hope she said such was not my suggestion he said she heard the steel in his voice the sense of command and stared across the grey darkness of the stilltent at him paul was a silhouette against moonfrosted rocks seen through the tents transparent end others among your fathers men will have escaped she said we must regather them find we will depend upon ourselves he said our immediate concern is our family atomics we must get them before the harkonnens can search them out not likely theyll be found she said the way they were hidden it must not be left to chance and she thought blackmail with the family atomics as a threat to the planet and its spicethats what he has in mind but all he can hope for then is escape into renegade anonymity his mothers words had provoked another train of thought in paula dukes concern for all the people theyd lost this night people are the true strength of a great house paul thought and he remembered hawats words parting with people is a sadness a place is only a place theyre using sardaukar jessica said we must wait until the sardaukar have been withdrawn they think us caught between the desert and the sardaukar paul said they intend that there be no atreides survivorstotal extermination do not count on any of our people escaping they can not go on indefinitely risking exposure of the emperors part in this cant they some of our people are bound to escape are they jessica turned away frightened of the bitter strength in her sons voice hearing the precise assessment of chances she sensed that his mind had leaped ahead of her that it now saw more in some respects than she did she had helped train the intelligence which did this but now she found herself fearful of it her thoughts turned seeking toward the lost sanctuary of her duke and tears burned her eyes this is the way it had to be leto she thought a time of love and a time of grief she rested her hand on her abdomen awareness focused on the embryo there i have the atreides daughter i was ordered to produce but the reverend mother was wrong a daughter wouldnt have saved my leto this child is only life reaching for the future in the midst of death i conceived out of instinct and not out of obedience try the communinet receiver again paul said the mind goes on working no matter how we try to hold it back she thought jessica found the tiny receiver idaho had left for them flipped its switch a green light glowed on the instruments face tinny screeching came from its speaker she reduced the volume hunted across the bands a voice speaking atreides battle language came into the tent back and regroup at the ridge fedor reports no survivors in carthag and the guild bank has been sacked carthag jessica thought that was a harkonnen hotbed theyre sardaukar the voice said watch out for sardaukar in atreides uniforms theyre a roaring filled the speaker then silence try the other bands paul said do you realize what that means jessica asked i expected it they want the guild to blame us for destruction of their bank with the guild against us were trapped on arrakis try the other bands she weighed his words i expected it what had happened to him slowly jessica returned to the instrument as she moved the bandslide they caught glimpses of violence in the few voices calling out in atreides battle language fallback try to regroup at trapped in a cave at and there was no mistaking the victorious exultation in the harkonnen gibberish that poured from the other bands sharp commands battle reports there wasnt enough of it for jessica to register and break the language but the tone was obvious harkonnen victory paul shook the pack beside him hearing the two literjons of water gurgle there he took a deep breath looked up through the transparent end of the tent at the rock escarpment outlined against the stars his left hand felt the sphincterseal of the tents entrance itll be dawn soon he said we can wait through the day for idaho but not through another night in the desert you must travel by night and rest in shade through the day remembered lore insinuated itself into jessicas mind without a stillsuit a man sitting in shade on the desert needs five liters of water a day to maintain body weight she felt the slicksoft skin of the stillsuit against her body thinking how their lives depended on these garments if we leave here idaho cant find us she said there are ways to make any man talk he said if idaho hasnt returned by dawn we must consider the possibility he has been captured how long do you think he could hold out the question required no answer and she sat in silence paul lifted the seal on the pack pulled out a tiny micromanual with glowtab and magnifier green and orange letters leaped up at him from the pages literjons stilltent energy caps recaths sandsnork binoculars stillsuit repkit baradye pistol sinkchart filtplugs paracompass maker hooks thumpers fremkit fire pillar so many things for survival on the desert presently he put the manual aside on the tent floor where can we possibly go jessica asked my father spoke of desert power paul said the harkonnens can not rule this planet without it theyve never ruled this planet nor shall they not even with ten thousand legions of sardaukar paul you cant think that weve all the evidence in our hands he said right here in this tentthe tent itself this pack and its contents these stillsuits we know the guild wants a prohibitive price for weather satellites we know that whatve weather satellites to do with it she asked they couldnt possibly she broke off paul sensed the hyperalertness of his mind reading her reactions computing on minutiae you see it now he said satellites watch the terrain below there are things in the deep desert that will not bear frequent inspection youre suggesting the guild itself controls this planet she was so slow no he said the fremen theyre paying the guild for privacy paying in a coin thats freely available to anyone with desert powerspice this is more than a secondapproximation answer its the straightline computation depend on it paul jessica said youre not a mentat yet you cant know for sure how ill never be a mentat he said im something else a freak paul how can you say such leave me alone he turned away from her looking out into the night why cant i mourn he wondered he felt that every fiber of his being craved this release but it would be denied him forever jessica had never heard such distress in her sons voice she wanted to reach out to him hold him comfort him help himbut she sensed there was nothing she could do he had to solve this problem by himself the glowing tab of the fremkit manual between them on the tent floor caught her eye she lifted it glanced at the flyleaf reading manual of the friendly desert the place full of life here are the ayat and burhan of life believe and allat shall never burn you it reads like the azhar book she thought recalling her studies of the great secrets has a manipulator of religions been on arrakis paul lifted the paracompass from the pack returned it said think of all these specialapplication fremen machines they show unrivaled sophistication admit it the culture that made these things betrays depths no one suspected hesitating still worried by the harshness in his voice jessica returned to the book studied an illustrated constellation from the arrakeen sky muaddib the mouse and noted that the tail pointed north paul stared into the tents darkness at the dimly discerned movements of his mother revealed by the manuals glowtab now is the time to carry out my fathers wish he thought i must give her his message now while she has time for grief grief would inconvenience us later and he found himself shocked by precise logic mother he said yes she heard the change in his voice felt coldness in her entrails at the sound never had she heard such harsh control my father is dead he said she searched within herself for the coupling of fact and fact and factthe bene gesserit way of assessing dataand it came to her the sensation of terrifying loss jessica nodded unable to speak my father charged me once paul said to give you a message if anything happened to him he feared you might believe he distrusted you that useless suspicion she thought he wanted you to know he never suspected you paul said and explained the deception adding he wanted you to know he always trusted you completely always loved you and cherished you he said he would sooner have mistrusted himself and he had but one regretthat he never made you his duchess she brushed the tears coursing down her cheeks thought what a stupid waste of the bodys water but she knew this thought for what it wasthe attempt to retreat from grief into anger leto my leto she thought what terrible things we do to those we love with a violent motion she extinguished the little manuals glowtab sobs shook her paul heard his mothers grief and felt the emptiness within himself i have no grief he thought why why he felt the inability to grieve as a terrible flaw a time to get and time to lose jessica thought quoting to herself from the oc bible a time to keep and a time to cast away a time for love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace pauls mind had gone on in its chilling precision he saw the avenues ahead of them on this hostile planet without even the safety valve of dreaming he focused his prescient awareness seeing it as a computation of most probable futures but with something more an edge of mysteryas though his mind dipped into some timeless stratum and sampled the winds of the future abruptly as though he had found a necessary key pauls mind climbed another notch in awareness he felt himself clinging to this new level clutching at a precarious hold and peering about it was as though he existed within a globe with avenues radiating away in all directions yet this only approximated the sensation he remembered once seeing a gauze kerchief blowing in the wind and now he sensed the future as though it twisted across some surface as undulant and impermanent as that of the windblown kerchief he saw people he felt the heat and cold of uncounted probabilities he knew names and places experienced emotions without number reviewed data of innumerable unexplored crannies there was time to probe and test and taste but no time to shape the thing was a spectrum of possibilities from the most remote past to the most remote futurefrom the most probable to the most improbable he saw his own death in countless ways he saw new planets new cultures people people he saw them in such swarms they could not be listed yet his mind catalogued them even the guildsmen and he thought the guildthere d be a way for us my strangeness accepted as a familiar thing of high value always with an assured supply of the nownecessary spice but the idea of living out his life in the mindgropingaheadthroughpossiblefutures that guided hurtling spaceships appalled him it was a way though and in meeting the possible future that contained guildsmen he recognized his own strangeness i have another kind of sight i see another kind of terrain the available paths the awareness conveyed both reassurance and alarmso many places on that other kind of terrain dipped or turned out of his sight as swiftly as it had come the sensation slipped away from him and he realized the entire experience had taken the space of a heartbeat yet his own personal awareness had been turned over illuminated in a terrifying way he stared around him night still covered the stilltent within its rockenclosed hideaway his mothers grief could still be heard his own lack of grief could still be felt that hollow place somewhere separated from his mind which went on in its steady pacedealing with data evaluating computing submitting answers in something like the mentat way and now he saw that he had a wealth of data few such minds ever before had encompassed but this made the empty place within him no easier to bear he felt that something must shatter it was as though a clockwork control for a bomb had been set to ticking within him it went on about its business no matter what he wanted it recorded minuscule shadings of difference around hima slight change in moisture a fractional fall in temperature the progress of an insect across their stilltent roof the solemn approach of dawn in the starlighted patch of sky he could see out the tents transparent end the emptiness was unbearable knowing how the clockwork had been set in motion made no difference he could look to his own past and see the start of itthe training the sharpening of talents the refined pressures of sophisticated disciplines even exposure to the oc bible at a critical moment and lastly the heavy intake of spice and he could look aheadthe most terrifying directionto see where it all pointed im a monster he thought a freak no he said then no no no he found that he was pounding the tent floor with his fists the implacable part of him recorded this as an interesting emotional datum and fed it into computation paul his mother was beside him holding his hands her face a gray blob peering at him paul whats wrong you he said im here paul she said its all right what have you done to me he demanded in a burst of clarity she sensed some of the roots in the question said i gave birth to you it was from instinct as much as her own subtle knowledge the precisely correct answer to calm him he felt her hands holding him focused on the dim outline of her face certain gene traces in her facial structure were noted in the new way by his onflowing mind the clues added to other data and a finalsummation answer put forward let go of me he said she heard the iron in his voice obeyed do you want to tell me whats wrong paul did you know what you were doing when you trained me he asked theres no more childhood in his voice she thought and she said i hoped the thing any parent hopesthat youd be superior different different she heard the bitterness in his tone said paul i you didnt want a son he said you wanted a kwisatz haderach you wanted a male bene gesserit she recoiled from his bitterness but paul did you ever consult my father in this she spoke gently out of the freshness of her grief whatever you are paul the heredity is as much your father as me but not the training he said not the things that awakened the sleeper sleeper its here he put a hand to his head and then to his breast in me it goes on and on and on and on and paul she had heard the hysteria edging his voice listen to me he said you wanted the reverend mother to hear about my dreams you listen in her place now ive just had a waking dream do you know why you must calm yourself she said if theres the spice he said its in everything herethe air the soil the food the geriatric spice its like the truthsayer drug its a poison she stiffened his voice lowered and he repeated a poisonso subtle so insidious so irreversible it wont even kill you unless you stop taking it we cant leave arrakis unless we take part of arrakis with us the terrifying presence of his voice brooked no dispute you and the spice paul said the spice changes anyone who gets this much of it but thanks to you i could bring the change to consciousness i dont get to leave it in the unconscious where its disturbance can be blanked out i can see it paul you i see it he repeated she heard madness in his voice didnt know what to do but he spoke again and she heard the iron control return to him were trapped here were trapped here she agreed and she accepted the truth of his words no pressure of the bene gesserit no trickery or artifice could pry them completely free from arrakis the spice was addictive her body had known the fact long before her mind awakened to it so here we live out our lives she thought on this hellplanet the place is prepared for us if we can evade the harkonnens and theres no doubt of my course a broodmare preserving an important bloodline for the bene gesserit plan i must tell you about my waking dream paul said now there was fury in his voice to be sure you accept what i say ill tell you first i know youll bear a daughter my sister here on arrakis jessica placed her hands against the tent floor pressed back against the curving fabric wall to still a pang of fear she knew her pregnancy could not show yet only her own bene gesserit training had allowed her to read the first faint signals of her body to know of the embryo only a few weeks old only to serve jessica whispered clinging to the bene gesserit motto we exist only to serve well find a home among the fremen paul said where your missionaria protectiva has bought us a bolt hole theyve prepared a way for us in the desert jessica told herself but how can he know of the missionaria protectiva she found it increasingly difficult to subdue her terror at the overpowering strangeness in paul he studied the dark shadow of her seeing her fear and every reaction with his new awareness as though she were outlined in blinding light a beginning of compassion for her crept over him the things that can happen here i can not begin to tell you he said i can not even begin to tell myself although ive seen them this sense of the futurei seem to have no control over it the thing just happens the immediate futuresay a yeari can see some of that a road as broad as our central avenue on caladan some places i dont see shadowed places as though it went behind a hill and again he thought of the surface of a blowing kerchief and there are branchings he fell silent as memory of that seeing filled him no prescient dream no experience of his life had quite prepared him for the totality with which the veils had been ripped away to reveal naked time recalling the experience he recognized his own terrible purposethe pressure of his life spreading outward like an expanding bubble time retreating before it jessica found the tents glowtab control activated it dim green light drove back the shadows easing her fear she looked at pauls face his eyesthe inward stare and she knew where she had seen such a look before pictured in records of disasterson the faces of children who experienced starvation or terrible injury the eyes were like pits mouth a straight line cheeks indrawn its the look of terrible awareness she thought of someone forced to the knowledge of his own mortality he was indeed no longer a child the underlying import of his words began to take over in her mind pushing all else aside paul could see ahead a way of escape for them theres a way to evade the harkonnens she said the harkonnens he sneered put those twisted humans out of your mind he stared at his mother studying the lines of her face in the light of the glowtab the lines betrayed her she said you shouldnt refer to people as humans without dont be so sure you know where to draw the line he said we carry our past with us and mother mine theres a thing you dont know and shouldwe are harkonnens her mind did a terrifying thing it blanked out as though it needed to shut off all sensation but pauls voice went on at that implacable pace dragging her with it when next you find a mirror study your facestudy mine now the traces are there if you dont blind yourself look at my hands the set of my bones and if none of this convinces you then take my word for it ive walked the future ive looked at a record ive seen a place i have all the data were harkonnens a renegade branch of the family she said thats it isnt it some harkonnen cousin who youre the barons own daughter he said and watched the way she pressed her hands to her mouth the baron sampled many pleasures in his youth and once permitted himself to be seduced but it was for the genetic purposes of the bene gesserit by one of you the way he said you struck her like a slap but it set her mind to working and she could not deny his words so many blank ends of meaning in her past reached out now and linked the daughter the bene gesserit wantedit wasnt to end the old atreidesharkonnen feud but to fix some genetic factor in their lines what she groped for an answer as though he saw inside her mind paul said they thought they were reaching for me but im not what they expected and ive arrived before my time and they dont know it jessica pressed her hands to her mouth great mother hes the kwisatz haderach she felt exposed and naked before him realizing then that he saw her with eyes from which little could be hidden and that she knew was the basis of her fear youre thinking im the kwisatz haderach he said put that out of your mind im something unexpected i must get word out to one of the schools she thought the mating index may show what has happened they wont learn about me until its too late he said she sought to divert him lowered her hands and said well find a place among the fremen the fremen have a saying they credit to shaihulud old father eternity he said they say be prepared to appreciate what you meet and he thought yes mother mineamong the fremen youll acquire the blue eyes and a callus beside your lovely nose from the filter tube to your stillsuit and youll bear my sister st alia of the knife if youre not the kwisatz haderach jessica said what you couldnt possibly know he said you wont believe it until you see it and he thought im a seed he suddenly saw how fertile was the ground into which he had fallen and with this realization the terrible purpose filled him creeping through the empty place within threatening to choke him with grief he had seen two main branchings along the way aheadin one he confronted an evil old baron and said hello grandfather the thought of that path and what lay along it sickened him the other path held long patches of grey obscurity except for peaks of violence he had seen a warrior religion there a fire spreading across the universe with the atreides green and black banner waving at the head of fanatic legions drunk on spice liquor gurney halleck and a few others of his fathers mena pitiful fewwere among them all marked by the hawk symbol from the shrine of his fathers skull i cant go that way he muttered thats what the old witches of your schools really want i dont understand you paul his mother said he remained silent thinking like the seed he was thinking with the race consciousness he had first experienced as terrible purpose he found that he no longer could hate the bene gesserit or the emperor or even the harkonnens they were all caught up in the need of their race to renew its scattered inheritance to cross and mingle and infuse their bloodlines in a great new pooling of genes and the race knew only one sure way for thisthe ancient way the tried and certain way that rolled over everything in its path jihad surely i can not choose that way he thought but he saw again in his minds eye the shrine of his fathers skull and the violence with the green and black banner waving in its midst jessica cleared her throat worried by his silence then the fremen will give us sanctuary he looked up staring across the greenlighted tent at the inbred patrician lines of her face yes he said thats one of the ways he nodded yes theyll call me muaddib the one who points the way yes thats what theyll call me and he closed his eyes thinking now my father i can mourn you and he felt the tears coursing down his cheeks book two muaddib when my father the padishah emperor heard of duke letos death and the manner of it he went into such a rage as we had never before seen he blamed my mother and the compact forced on him to place a bene gesserit on the throne he blamed the guild and the evil old baron he blamed everyone in sight not excepting even me for he said i was a witch like all the others and when i sought to comfort him saying it was done according to an older law of selfpreservation to which even the most ancient rulers gave allegiance he sneered at me and asked if i thought him a weakling i saw then that he had been aroused to this passion not by concern over the dead duke but by what that death implied for all royalty as i look back on it i think there may have been some prescience in my father too for it is certain that his line and muaddibs shared common ancestry in my fathers house by the princess irulan now harkonnen shall kill harkonnen paul whispered he had awakened shortly before nightfall sitting up in the sealed and darkened stilltent as he spoke he heard the vague stirrings of his mother where she slept against the tents opposite wall paul glanced at the proximity detector on the floor studying the dials illuminated in the blackness by phosphor tubes it should be night soon his mother said why dont you lift the tent shades paul realized then that her breathing had been different for some time that she had lain silent in the darkness until certain he was awake lifting the shades wouldnt help he said theres been a storm the tents covered by sand ill dig us out soon no sign of duncan yet none paul rubbed absently at the ducal signet on his thumb and a sudden rage against the very substance of this planet which had helped kill his father set him trembling i heard the storm begin jessica said the undemanding emptiness of her words helped restore some of his calm his mind focused on the storm as he had seen it begin through the transparent end of their stilltentcold dribbles of sand crossing the basin then runnels and tails furrowing the sky he had looked up to a rock spire seen it change shape under the blast becoming a low cheddarcolored wedge sand funneled into their basin had shadowed the sky with dull curry then blotted out all light as the tent was covered tent bows had creaked once as they accepted the pressure thensilence broken only by the dim bellows wheezing of their sand snorkel pumping air from the surface try the receiver again jessica said no use he said he found his stillsuits watertube in its clip at his neck drew a warm swallow into his mouth and he thought that here he truly began an arrakeen existenceliving on reclaimed moisture from his own breath and body it was flat and tasteless water but it soothed his throat jessica heard paul drinking felt the slickness of her own stillsuit clinging to her body but she refused to accept her thirst to accept it would require awakening fully into the terrible necessities of arrakis where they must guard even fractional traces of moisture hoarding the few drops in the tents catchpockets begrudging a breath wasted on the open air so much easier to drift back down into sleep but there had been a dream in this days sleep and she shivered at memory of it she had held dreaming hands beneath sandflow where a name had been written duke leto atreides the name had blurred with the sand and she had moved to restore it but the first letter filled before the last was begun the sand would not stop her dream became wailing louder and louder that ridiculous wailingpart of her mind had realized the sound was her own voice as a tiny child little more than a baby a woman not quite visible to memory was going away my unknown mother jessica thought the bene gesserit who bore me and gave me to the sisters because thats what she was commanded to do was she glad to rid herself of a harkonnen child the place to hit them is in the spice paul said how can he think of attack at a time like this she asked herself an entire planet full of spice she said how can you hit them there she heard him stirring the sound of their pack being dragged across the tent floor it was sea power and air power on caladan he said here its desert power the fremen are the key his voice came from the vicinity of the tents sphincter her bene gesserit training sensed in his tone an unresolved bitterness toward her all his life he has been trained to hate harkonnens she thought now he finds he is harkonnen because of me how little he knows me i was my dukes only woman i accepted his life and his values even to defying my bene gesserit orders the tents glowtab came alight under pauls hand filled the domed area with green radiance paul crouched at the sphincter his stillsuit hood adjusted for the open desertforehead capped mouth filter in place nose plugs adjusted only his dark eyes were visible a narrow band of face that turned once toward her and away secure yourself for the open he said and his voice was blurred behind the filter jessica pulled the filter across her mouth began adjusting her hood as she watched paul break the tent seal sand rasped as he opened the sphincter and a burred fizzle of grains ran into the tent before he could immobilize it with a static compaction tool a hole grew in the sandwall as the tool realigned the grains he slipped out and her ears followed his progress to the surface what will we find out there she wondered harkonnen troops and the sardaukar those are dangers we can expect but what of the dangers we dont know she thought of the compaction tool and the other strange instruments in the pack each of these tools suddenly stood in her mind as a sign of mysterious dangers she felt then a hot breeze from surface sand touch her cheeks where they were exposed above the filter pass up the pack it was pauls voice low and guarded she moved to obey heard the water literjons gurgle as she shoved the pack across the floor she peered upward saw paul framed against stars here he said and reached down pulled the pack to the surface now she saw only the circle of stars they were like the luminous tips of weapons aimed down at her a shower of meteors crossed her patch of night the meteors seemed to her like a warning like tiger stripes like luminous grave slats clabbering her blood and she felt the chill of the price on their heads hurry up paul said i want to collapse the tent a shower of sand from the surface brushed her left hand how much sand will the hand hold she asked herself shall i help you paul asked no she swallowed in a dry throat slipped into the hole felt staticpacked sand rasp under her hands paul reached down took her arm she stood beside him on a smooth patch of starlit desert stared around sand almost brimmed their basin leaving only a dim lip of surrounding rock she probed the farther darkness with her trained senses noise of small animals birds a fall of dislodged sand and faint creature sounds within it paul collapsing their tent recovering it up the hole starlight displaced just enough of the night to charge each shadow with menace she looked at patches of blackness black is a blind remembering she thought you listen for pack sounds for the cries of those who hunted your ancestors in a past so ancient only your most primitive cells remember the ears see the nostrils see presently paul stood beside her said duncan told me that if he was captured he could hold out this long we must leave here now he shouldered the pack crossed to the shallow lip of the basin climbed to a ledge that looked down on open desert jessica followed automatically noting how she now lived in her sons orbit for now is my grief heavier than the sands of the seas she thought this world has emptied me of all but the oldest purpose tomorrows life i live now for my young duke and the daughter yet to be she felt the sand drag her feet as she climbed to pauls side he looked north across a line of rocks studying a distant escarpment the faraway rock profile was like an ancient battleship of the seas outlined by stars the long swish of it lifted on an invisible wave with syllables of boomerang antennae funnels arcing back a pishaped upthrusting at the stern an orange glare burst above the silhouette and a line of brilliant purple cut downward toward the glare another line of purple and another upthrusting orange glare it was like an ancient naval battle remembered shellfire and the sight held them staring pillars of fire paul whispered a ring of red eyes lifted over the distant rock lines of purple laced the sky jetflares and lasguns jessica said the dustreddened first moon of arrakis lifted above the horizon to their left and they saw a storm trail therea ribbon of movement over the desert it must be harkonnen thopters hunting us paul said the way theyre cutting up the desert its as though they were making certain they stamped out whatevers there the way youd stamp out a nest of insects or a nest of atreides jessica said we must seek cover paul said well head south and keep to the rocks if they caught us in the open he turned adjusting the pack to his shoulders theyre killing anything that moves he took one step along the ledge and in that instant heard the low hiss of gliding aircraft saw the dark shapes of ornithopters above them my father once told me that respect for the truth comes close to being the basis for all morality something can not emerge from nothing he said this is profound thinking if you understand how unstable the truth can be from conversations with muaddib by the princess irulan ive always prided myself on seeing things the way they truly are thufir hawat said thats the curse of being a mentat you cant stop analyzing your data the leathered old face appeared composed in the predawn dimness as he spoke his saphostained lips were drawn into a straight line with radial creases spreading upward a robed man squatted silently on sand across from hawat apparently unmoved by the words the two crouched beneath a rock overhang that looked down on a wide shallow sink dawn was spreading over the shattered outline of cliffs across the basin touching everything with pink it was cold under the overhang a dry and penetrating chill left over from the night there had been a warm wind just before dawn but now it was cold hawat could hear teeth chattering behind him among the few troopers remaining in his force the man squatting across from hawat was a fremen who had come across the sink in the first light of false dawn skittering over the sand blending into the dunes his movements barely discernible the fremen extended a finger to the sand between them drew a figure there it looked like a bowl with an arrow spilling out of it there are many harkonnen patrols he said he lifted his finger pointed upward across the cliffs that hawat and his men had descended hawat nodded many patrols yes but still he did not know what this fremen wanted and this rankled mentat training was supposed to give a man the power to see motives this had been the worst night of hawats life he had been at tsimpo a garrison village buffer outpost for the former capital city carthag when the reports of attack began arriving at first hed thought its a raid the harkonnens are testing but report followed reportfaster and faster two legions landed at carthag five legionsfifty brigades attacking the dukes main base at arrakeen a legion at arsunt two battle groups at splintered rock then the reports became more detailedthere were imperial sardaukar among the attackerspossibly two legions of them and it became clear that the invaders knew precisely which weight of arms to send where precisely superb intelligence hawats shocked fury had mounted until it threatened the smooth functioning of his mentat capabilities the size of the attack struck his mind like a physical blow now hiding beneath a bit of desert rock he nodded to himself pulled his torn and slashed tunic around him as though warding off the cold shadows the size of the attack he had always expected their enemy to hire an occasional lighter from the guild for probing raids that was an ordinary enough gambit in this kind of housetohouse warfare lighters landed and took off on arrakis regularly to transport the spice for house atreides hawat had taken precautions against random raids by false spice lighters for a full attack theyd expected no more than ten brigades but there were more than two thousand ships down on arrakis at the last countnot just lighters but frigates scouts monitors crushers troopcarriers dumpboxes more than a hundred brigadesten legions the entire spice income of arrakis for fifty years might just cover the cost of such a venture it might i underestimated what the baron was willing to spend in attacking us hawat thought i failed my duke then there was the matter of the traitor i will live long enough to see her strangled he thought i shouldve killed that bene gesserit witch when i had the chance there was no doubt in his mind who had betrayed themthe lady jessica she fitted all the facts available your man gurney halleck and part of his force are safe with our smuggler friends the fremen said good so gurney will get off this hell planet we re not all gone hawat glanced back at the huddle of his men he had started the night just past with three hundred of his finest of those an even twenty remained and half of them were wounded some of them slept now standing up leaning against the rock sprawled on the sand beneath the rock their last thopter the one theyd been using as a groundeffect machine to carry their wounded had given out just before dawn they had cut it up with lasguns and hidden the pieces then worked their way down into this hiding place at the edge of the basin hawat had only a rough idea of their locationsome two hundred kilometers southeast of arrakeen the main traveled ways between the shield wall sietch communities were somewhere south of them the fremen across from hawat threw back his hood and stillsuit cap to reveal sandy hair and beard the hair was combed straight back from a high thin forehead he had the unreadable total blue eyes of the spice diet beard and mustache were stained at one side of the mouth his hair matted there by pressure of the looping catchtube from his nose plugs the man removed his plugs readjusted them he rubbed at a scar beside his nose if you cross the sink here this night the fremen said you must not use shields there is a break in the wall he turned on his heels pointed south there and it is open sand down to the erg shields will attract a he hesitated worm they dont often come in here but a shield will bring one every time he said worm hawat thought he was going to say something else what and what does he want of us hawat sighed he could not recall ever before being this tired it was a muscle weariness that energy pills were unable to ease those damnable sardaukar with a selfaccusing bitterness he faced the thought of the soldierfanatics and the imperial treachery they represented his own mentat assessment of the data told him how little chance he had ever to present evidence of this treachery before the high council of the landsraad where justice might be done do you wish to go to the smugglers the fremen asked is it possible the way is long fremen dont like to say no idaho had told him once hawat said you havent yet told me whether your people can help my wounded they are wounded the same damned answer every time we know theyre wounded hawat snapped thats not the peace friend the fremen cautioned what do your wounded say are there those among them who can see the water need of your tribe we havent talked about water hawat said we i can understand your reluctance the fremen said they are your friends your tribesmen do you have water not enough the fremen gestured to hawats tunic the skin exposed beneath it you were caught insietch without your suits you must make a water decision friend can we hire your help the fremen shrugged you have no water he glanced at the group behind hawat how many of your wounded would you spend hawat fell silent staring at the man he could see as a mentat that their communication was out of phase wordsounds were not being linked up here in the normal manner i am thufir hawat he said i can speak for my duke i will make promissory commitment now for your help i wish a limited form of help preserving my force long enough only to kill a traitor who thinks herself beyond vengeance you wish our siding in a vendetta the vendetta ill handle myself i wish to be freed of responsibility for my wounded that i may get about it the fremen scowled how can you be responsible for your wounded they are their own responsibility the waters at issue thufir hawat would you have me take that decision away from you the man put a hand to a weapon concealed beneath his robe hawat tensed wondering is there betrayal here what do you fear the fremen demanded these people and their disconcerting directness hawat spoke cautiously theres a price on my head ahhhh the fremen removed his hand from his weapon you think we have the byzantine corruption you dont know us the harkonnens have not water enough to buy the smallest child among us but they had the price of guild passage for more than two thousand fighting ships hawat thought and the size of that price still staggered him we both fight harkonnens hawat said should we not share the problems and ways of meeting the battle issue we are sharing the fremen said i have seen you fight harkonnens you are good thereve been times id have appreciated your arm beside me say where my arm may help you hawat said who knows the fremen asked there are harkonnen forces everywhere but you still have not made the water decision or put it to your wounded i must be cautious hawat told himself theres a thing here thats not understood he said will you show me your way the arrakeen way strangerthinking the fremen said and there was a sneer in his tone he pointed to the northwest across the clifftop we watched you come across the sand last night he lowered his arm you keep your force on the slipface of the dunes bad you have no stillsuits no water you will not last long the ways of arrakis dont come easily hawat said truth but weve killed harkonnens what do you do with your own wounded hawat demanded does a man not know when he is worth saving the fremen asked your wounded know you have no water he tilted his head looking sideways up at hawat this is clearly a time for water decision both wounded and unwounded must look to the tribes future the tribes future hawat thought the tribe of atreides theres sense in that he forced himself to the question he had been avoiding have you word of my duke or his son unreadable blue eyes stared upward into hawats word their fate hawat snapped fate is the same for everyone the fremen said your duke it is said has met his fate as to the lisan algaib his son that is in liets hands liet has not said i knew the answer without asking hawat thought he glanced back at his men they were all awake now they had heard they were staring out across the sand the realization in their expressions there was no returning to caladan for them and now arrakis was lost hawat turned back to the fremen have you heard of duncan idaho he was in the great house when the shield went down the fremen said this ive heard no more she dropped the shield and let in the harkonnens he thought i was the one who sat with my back to a door how could she do this when it meant turning also against her own son but who knows how a bene gesserit witch thinks if you can call it thinking hawat tried to swallow in a dry throat when will you hear about the boy we know little of what happens in arrakeen the fremen said he shrugged who knows you have ways of finding out perhaps the fremen rubbed at the scar beside his nose tell me thufir hawat do you have knowledge of the big weapons the harkonnens used the artillery hawat thought bitterly who could have guessed theyd use artillery in this day of shields you refer to the artillery they used to trap our people in the caves he said ive theoretical knowledge of such explosive weapons any man who retreats into a cave which has only one opening deserves to die the fremen said why do you ask about these weapons liet wishes it is that what he wants from us hawat wondered he said did you come here seeking information about the big guns liet wished to see one of the weapons for himself then you should just go take one hawat sneered yes the fremen said we took one we have it hidden where stilgar can study it for liet and where liet can see it for himself if he wishes but i doubt hell want to the weapon is not a very good one poor design for arrakis you took one hawat asked it was a good fight the fremen said we lost only two men and spilled the water from more than a hundred of theirs there were sardaukar at every gun hawat thought this desert madman speaks casually of losing only two men against sardaukar we would not have lost the two except for those others fighting beside the harkonnens the fremen said some of those are good fighters one of hawats men limped forward looked down at the squatting fremen are you talking about sardaukar hes talking about sardaukar hawat said sardaukar the fremen said and there appeared to be glee in his voice ahhh so thats what they are this was a good night indeed sardaukar which legion do you know we dont know hawat said sardaukar the fremen mused yet they wear harkonnen clothing is that not strange the emperor does not wish it known he fights against a great house hawat said but you know they are sardaukar who am i hawat asked bitterly you are thufir hawat the man said matteroffactly well we would have learned it in time weve sent three of them captive to be questioned by liets men hawats aide spoke slowly disbelief in every word you captured sardaukar only three of them the fremen said they fought well if only wed had the time to link up with these fremen hawat thought it was a sour lament in his mind if only we couldve trained them and armed them great mother what a fighting force wed have had perhaps you delay because of worry over the lisan algaib the fremen said if he is truly the lisan algaib harm can not touch him do not spend thoughts on a matter which has not been proved i serve the lisan algaib hawat said his welfare is my concern ive pledged myself to this you are pledged to his water hawat glanced at his aide who was still staring at the fremen returned his attention to the squatting figure to his water yes you wish to return to arrakeen to the place of his water to yes to the place of his water why did you not say at first it was a water matter the fremen stood up seated his nose plugs firmly hawat motioned with his head for his aide to return to the others with a tired shrug the man obeyed hawat heard a lowvoiced conversation arise among the men the fremen said there is always a way to water behind hawat a man cursed hawats aide called thufir arkie just died the fremen put a fist to his ear the bond of water its a sign he stared at hawat we have a place nearby for accepting the water shall i call my men the aide returned to hawats side said thufir a couple of the men left wives in arrakeen theyre well you know how it is at a time like this the fremen still held his fist to his ear is it the bond of water thufir hawat he demanded hawats mind was racing he sensed now the direction of the fremens words but feared the reaction of the tired men under the rock overhang when they understood it the bond of water hawat said let our tribes be joined the fremen said and he lowered his fist as though that were the signal four men slid and dropped down from the rocks above them they darted back under the overhang rolled the dead man in a loose robe lifted him and began running with him along the cliff wall to the right spurts of dust lifted around their running feet it was over before hawats tired men could gather their wits the group with the body hanging like a sack in its enfolding robe was gone around a turn in the cliff one of hawats men shouted where they going with arkie he was theyre taking him to bury him hawat said fremen dont bury their dead the man barked dont you try any tricks on us thufir we know what they do arkie was one of paradise were sure for a man who died in the service of lisan algaib the fremen said if it is the lisan algaib you serve as you have said it why raise mourning cries the memory of one who died in this fashion will live as long as the memory of man endures but hawats men advanced angry looks on their faces one had captured a lasgun he started to draw it stop right where you are hawat barked he fought down the sick fatigue that gripped his muscles these people respect our dead customs differ but the meanings the same theyre going to render arkie down for his water the man with the lasgun snarled is it that your men wish to attend the ceremony the fremen asked he doesnt even see the problem hawat thought the naivete of the fremen was frightening theyre concerned for a respected comrade hawat said we will treat your comrade with the same reverence we treat our own the fremen said this is the bond of water we know the rites a mans flesh is his own the water belongs to the tribe hawat spoke quickly as the man with the lasgun advanced another step will you now help our wounded one does not question the bond the fremen said we will do for you what a tribe does for its own first we must get all of you suited and see to the necessities the man with the lasgun hesitated hawats aide said are we buying help with arkies water not buying hawat said weve joined these people customs differ one of his men muttered hawat began to relax and theyll help us get to arrakeen we will kill harkonnens the fremen said he grinned and sardaukar he stepped backward cupped his hands beside his ears and tipped his head back listening presently he lowered his hands said an aircraft comes conceal yourselves beneath the rock and remain motionless at a gesture from hawat his men obeyed the fremen took hawats arm pressed him back with the others we will fight in the time of fighting the man said he reached beneath his robes brought out a small cage lifted a creature from it hawat recognized a tiny bat the bat turned its head and hawat saw its bluewithinblue eyes the fremen stroked the bat soothing it crooning to it he bent over the animals head allowed a drop of saliva to fall from his tongue into the bats upturned mouth the bat stretched its wings but remained on the fremens opened hand the man took a tiny tube held it beside the bats head and chattered into the tube then lifting the creature high he threw it upward the bat swooped away beside the cliff and was lost to sight the fremen folded the cage thrust it beneath his robe again he bent his head listening they quarter the high country he said one wonders who they seek up there its known that we retreated in this direction hawat said one should never presume one is the sole object of a hunt the fremen said watch the other side of the basin you will see a thing time passed some of hawats men stirred whispering remain silent as frightened animals the fremen hissed hawat discerned movement near the opposite cliffflitting blurs of tan on tan my little friend carried his message the fremen said he is a good messengerday or night ill be unhappy to lose that one the movement across the sink faded away on the entire four to five kilometer expanse of sand nothing remained but the growing pressure of the days heatblurred columns of rising air be most silent now the fremen whispered a file of plodding figures emerged from a break in the opposite cliff headed directly across the sink to hawat they appeared to be fremen but a curiously inept band he counted six men making heavy going of it over the dunes a thwokthwok of ornithopter wings sounded high to the right behind hawats group the craft came over the cliff wall above theman atreides thopter with harkonnen battle colors splashed on it the thopter swooped toward the men crossing the sink the group there stopped on a dune crest waved the thopter circled once over them in a tight curve came back for a dustshrouded landing in front of the fremen five men swarmed from the thopter and hawat saw the dustrepellent shimmering of shields and in their motions the hard competence of sardaukar aiihh they use their stupid shields the fremen beside hawat hissed he glanced toward the open south wall of the sink they are sardaukar hawat whispered good the sardaukar approached the waiting group of fremen in an enclosing halfcircle sun glinted on blades held ready the fremen stood in a compact group apparently indifferent abruptly the sand around the two groups sprouted fremen they were at the ornithopter then in it where the two groups had met at the dune crest a dust cloud partly obscured violent motion presently dust settled only fremen remained standing they left only three men in their thopter the fremen beside hawat said that was fortunate i dont believe we had to damage the craft in taking it behind hawat one of his men whispered those were sardaukar did you notice how well they fought the fremen asked hawat took a deep breath he smelled the burned dust around him felt the heat the dryness in a voice to match that dryness he said yes they fought well indeed the captured thopter took off with a lurching flap of wings angled upward to the south in a steep wingtucked climb so these fremen can handle thopters too hawat thought on the distant dune a fremen waved a square of green cloth once twice more come the fremen beside hawat barked be ready id hoped to have us away without more inconvenience inconvenience hawat thought he saw two more thopters swooping from high in the west onto an area of sand suddenly devoid of visible fremen only eight splotches of bluethe bodies of the sardaukar in harkonnen uniformsremained at the scene of violence another thopter glided in over the cliff wall above hawat he drew in a sharp breath as he saw ita big troop carrier it flew with the slow spreadwing heaviness of a full loadlike a giant bird coming to its nest in the distance the purple finger of a lasgun beam flicked from one of the diving thopters it laced across the sand raising a sharp trail of dust the cowards the fremen beside hawat rasped the troop carrier settled toward the patch of blueclad bodies its wings crept out to full reach began the cupping action of a quick stop hawats attention was caught by a flash of sun on metal to the south a thopter plummeting there in a power dive wings folded flat against its sides its jets a golden flare against the dark silvered gray of the sky it plunged like an arrow toward the troop carrier which was unshielded because of the lasgun activity around it straight into the carrier the diving thopter plunged a flaming roar shook the basin rocks tumbled from the cliff walls all around a geyser of redorange shot skyward from the sand where the carrier and its companion thopters had beeneverything there caught in the flame it was the fremen who took off in that captured thopter hawat thought he deliberately sacrificed himself to get that carrier great mother what are these fremen a reasonable exchange said the fremen beside hawat there mustve been three hundred men in that carrier now we must see to their water and make plans to get another aircraft he started to step out of their rockshadowed concealment a rain of blue uniforms came over the cliff wall in front of him falling in lowsuspensor slowness in the flashing instant hawat had time to see that they were sardaukar hard faces set in battle frenzy that they were unshielded and each carried a knife in one hand a stunner in the other a thrown knife caught hawats fremen companion in the throat hurting him backward twisting face down hawat had only time to draw his own knife before blackness of a stunner projectile felled him muaddib could indeed see the future but you must understand the limits of this power think of sight you have eyes yet can not see without light if you are on the floor of a valley you can not see beyond your valley just so muaddib could not always choose to look across the mysterious terrain he tells us that a single obscure decision of prophecy perhaps the choice of one word over another could change the entire aspect of the future he tells us the vision of time is broad but when you pass through it time becomes a narrow door and always he fought the temptation to choose a clear safe course warning that path leads ever down into stagnation from arrakis awakening by the princess irulan as the ornithopters glided out of the night above them paul grabbed his mothers arm snapped dont move then he saw the lead craft in the moonlight the way its wings cupped to brake for landing the reckless dash of the hands at the controls its idaho he breathed the craft and its companions settled into the basin like a covey of birds coming to nest idaho was out of his thopter and running toward them before the dust settled two figures in fremen robes followed him paul recognized one the tall sandybearded kynes this way kynes called and he veered left behind kynes other fremen were throwing fabric covers over their ornithopters the craft became a row of shallow dunes idaho skidded to a stop in front of paul saluted mlord the fremen have a temporary hiding place nearby where we what about that back there paul pointed to the violence above the distant cliffthe jetflares the purple beams of lasguns lacing the desert a rare smile touched idahos round placid face mlord sire ive left them a little sur glaring white light filled the desertbright as a sun etching their shadows onto the rock floor of the ledge in one sweeping motion idaho had pauls arm in one hand jessicas shoulder in the other hurling them down off the ledge into the basin they sprawled together in the sand as the roar of an explosion thundered over them its shock wave tumbled chips off the rock ledge they had vacated idaho sat up brushed sand from himself not the family atomics jessica said i thought you planted a shield back there paul said a big one turned to full force idaho said a lasgun beam touched it and he shrugged subatomic fusion jessica said thats a dangerous weapon not weapon mlady defense that scum will think twice before using lasguns another time the fremen from the ornithopters stopped above them one called in a low voice we should get under cover friends paul got to his feet as idaho helped jessica up that blast will attract considerable attention sire idaho said sire paul thought the word had such a strange sound when directed at him sire had always been his father he felt himself touched briefly by his powers of prescience seeing himself infected by the wild race consciousness that was moving the human universe toward chaos the vision left him shaken and he allowed idaho to guide him along the edge of the basin to a rock projection fremen there were opening a way down into the sand with their compaction tools may i take your pack sire idaho asked its not heavy duncan paul said you have no body shield idaho said do you wish mine he glanced at the distant cliff not likely therell be any more lasgun activity about keep your shield duncan your right arm is shield enough for me jessica saw the way the praise took effect how idaho moved closer to paul and she thought such a sure hand my son has with his people the fremen removed a rock plug that opened a passage down into the native basement complex of the desert a camouflage cover was rigged for the opening this way one of the fremen said and he led them down rock steps into darkness behind them the cover blotted out the moonlight a dim green glow came alive ahead revealing the steps and rock walls a turn to the left robed fremen were all around them now pressing downward they rounded the corner found another downslanting passage it opened into a rough cave chamber kynes stood before them jubba hood thrown back the neck of his stillsuit glistening in the green light his long hair and beard were mussed the blue eyes without whites were a darkness under heavy brows in the moment of encounter kynes wondered at himself why am i helping these people its the most dangerous thing ive ever done it could doom me with them then he looked squarely at paul seeing the boy who had taken on the mantle of manhood masking grief suppressing all except the position that now must be assumedthe dukedom and kynes realized in that moment the dukedom still existed and solely because of this youthand this was not a thing to be taken lightly jessica glanced once around the chamber registering it on her senses in the bene gesserit waya laboratory a civil place full of angles and squares in the ancient manner this is one of the imperial ecological testing stations my father wanted as advance bases paul said his father wanted kynes thought and again kynes wondered at himself am i foolish to aid these fugitives why am i doing it itd be so easy to take them now to buy the harkonnen trust with them paul followed his mothers example gestalting the room seeing the workbench down one side the walls of featureless rock instruments lined the benchdials glowing wire gridex planes with fluting glass emerging from them an ozone smell permeated the place some of the fremen moved on around a concealing angle in the chamber and new sounds started theremachine coughs the whinnies of spinning belts and multidrives paul looked to the end of the room saw cages with small animals in them stacked against the wall youve recognized this place correctly kynes said for what would you use such a place paul atreides to make this planet a fit place for humans paul said perhaps thats why i help them kynes thought the machine sounds abruptly hummed away to silence into this void there came a thin animal squeak from the cages it was cut off abruptly as though in embarrassment paul returned his attention to the cages saw that the animals were brownwinged bats an automatic feeder extended from the side wall across the cages a fremen emerged from the hidden area of the chamber spoke to kynes liet the fieldgenerator equipment is not working i am unable to mask us from proximity detectors can you repair it kynes asked not quickly the parts the man shrugged yes kynes said then well do without machinery get a hand pump for air out to the surface immediately the man hurried away kynes turned back to paul you gave a good answer jessica marked the easy rumble of the mans voice it was a royal voice accustomed to command and she had not missed the reference to him as liet liet was the fremen alter ego the other face of the tame planetologist were most grateful for your help doctor kynes she said mmmm well see kynes said he nodded to one of his men spice coffee in my quarters shamir at once liet the man said kynes indicated an arched opening in the side wall of the chamber if you please jessica allowed herself a regal nod before accepting she saw paul give a hand signal to idaho telling him to mount guard here the passage two paces deep opened through a heavy door into a square office lighted by golden glowglobes jessica passed her hand across the door as she entered was startled to identify plasteel paul stepped three paces into the room dropped his pack to the floor he heard the door close behind him studied the placeabout eight meters to a side walls of natural rock currycolored broken by metal filing cabinets on their right a low desk with milk glass top shot full of yellow bubbles occupied the rooms center four suspensor chairs ringed the desk kynes moved around paul held a chair for jessica she sat down noting the way her son examined the room paul remained standing for another eyeblink a faint anomaly in the rooms air currents told him there was a secret exit to their right behind the filing cabinets will you sit down paul atreides kynes asked how carefully he avoids my title paul thought but he accepted the chair remained silent while kynes sat down you sense that arrakis could be a paradise kynes said yet as you see the imperium sends here only its trained hatchetmen its seekers after the spice paul held up his thumb with its ducal signet do you see this ring yes do you know its significance jessica turned sharply to stare at her son your father lies dead in the ruins of arrakeen kynes said you are technically the duke im a soldier of the imperium paul said technically a hatchetman kynes face darkened even with the emperors sardaukar standing over your fathers body the sardaukar are one thing the legal source of my authority is another paul said arrakis has its own way of determining who wears the mantle of authority kynes said and jessica turning back to look at him thought theres steel in this man that no one has taken the temper out of and weve need of steel pauls doing a dangerous thing paul said the sardaukar on arrakis are a measure of how much our beloved emperor feared my father now i will give the padishah emperor reasons to fear the lad kynes said there are things you dont you will address me as sire or my lord paul said gently jessica thought kynes stared at paul and jessica noted the glint of admiration in the planetologists face the touch of humor there sire kynes said i am an embarrassment to the emperor paul said i am an embarrassment to all who would divide arrakis as their spoil as i live i shall continue to be such an embarrassment that i stick in their throats and choke them to death words kynes said paul stared at him presently paul said you have a legend of the lisan algaib here the voice from the outer world the one who will lead the fremen to paradise your men have superstition kynes said perhaps paul agreed yet perhaps not superstitions sometimes have strange roots and stranger branchings you have a plan kynes said this much is obvious sire could your fremen provide me with proof positive that the sardaukar are here in harkonnen uniform quite likely the emperor will put a harkonnen back in power here paul said perhaps even beast rabban let him once he has involved himself beyond escaping his guilt let the emperor face the possibility of a bill of particulars laid before the landsraad let him answer there where paul jessica said granted that the landsraad high council accepts your case kynes said there could be only one outcome general warfare between the imperium and the great houses chaos jessica said but id present my case to the emperor paul said and give him an alternative to chaos jessica spoke in a dry tone blackmail one of the tools of statecraft as youve said yourself paul said and jessica heard the bitterness in his voice the emperor has no sons only daughters youd aim for the throne jessica asked the emperor will not risk having the imperium shattered by total war paul said planets blasted disorder everywherehell not risk that this is a desperate gamble you propose kynes said what do the great houses of the landsraad fear most paul asked they fear most what is happening here right now on arrakisthe sardaukar picking them off one by one thats why there is a landsraad this is the glue of the great convention only in union do they match the imperial forces but theyre this is what they fear paul said arrakis would become a rallying cry each of them would see himself in my fathercut out of the herd and killed kynes spoke to jessica would his plan work im no mentat jessica said but you are bene gesserit she shot a probing stare at him said his plan has good points and bad points as any plan would at this stage a plan depends as much upon execution as it does upon concept law is the ultimate science paul quoted thus it reads above the emperors door i propose to show him law and im not sure i could trust the person who conceived this plan kynes said arrakis has its own plan that we from the throne paul said i could make a paradise of arrakis with the wave of a hand this is the coin i offer for your support kynes stiffened my loyaltys not for sale sire paul stared across the desk at him meeting the cold glare of those bluewithinblue eyes studying the bearded face the commanding appearance a harsh smile touched pauls lips and he said well spoken i apologize kynes met pauls stare and presently said no harkonnen ever admitted error perhaps youre not like them atreides it could be a fault in their education paul said you say youre not for sale but i believe ive the coin youll accept for your loyalty i offer my loyalty to you totally my son has the atreides sincerity jessica thought he has that tremendous almost naive honorand what a powerful force that truly is she saw that pauls words had shaken kynes this is nonsense kynes said youre just a boy and im the duke paul said im an atreides no atreides has ever broken such a bond kynes swallowed when i say totally paul said i mean without reservation i would give my life for you sire kynes said and the word was torn from him but jessica saw that he was not now speaking to a boy of fifteen but to a man to a superior now kynes meant the word in this moment hed give his life for paul she thought how do the atreides accomplish this thing so quickly so easily i know you mean this kynes said yet the harkon the door behind paul slammed open he whirled to see reeling violenceshouting the clash of steel waximage faces grimacing in the passage with his mother beside him paul leaped for the door seeing idaho blocking the passage his bloodpitted eyes there visible through a shield blur claw hands beyond him arcs of steel chopping futilely at the shield there was the orange firemouth of a stunner repelled by the shield idahos blades were through it all flickflicking red dripping from them then kynes was beside paul and they threw their weight against the door paul had one last glimpse of idaho standing against a swarm of harkonnen uniformshis jerking controlled staggers the black goat hair with a red blossom of death in it then the door was closed and there came a snick as kynes threw the bolts i appear tove decided kynes said someone detected your machinery before it was shut down paul said he pulled his mother away from the door met the despair in her eyes i shouldve suspected trouble when the coffee failed to arrive kynes said youve a bolt hole out of here paul said shall we use it kynes took a deep breath said this door should hold for at least twenty minutes against all but a lasgun theyll not use a lasgun for fear weve shields on this side paul said those were sardaukar in harkonnen uniform jessica whispered they could hear pounding on the door now rhythmic blows kynes indicated the cabinets against the righthand wall said this way he crossed to the first cabinet opened a drawer manipulated a handle within it the entire wall of cabinets swung open to expose the black mouth of a tunnel this door also is plasteel kynes said you were well prepared jessica said we lived under the harkonnens for eighty years kynes said he herded them into the darkness closed the door in the sudden blackness jessica saw a luminous arrow on the floor ahead of her kynes voice came from behind them well separate here this wall is tougher itll stand for at least an hour follow the arrows like that one on the floor theyll be extinguished by your passage they lead through a maze to another exit where ive secreted a thopter theres a storm across the desert tonight your only hope is to run for that storm dive into the top of it ride with it my people have done this in stealing thopters if you stay high in the storm youll survive what of you paul asked ill try to escape another way if im captured well im still imperial planetologist i can say i was your captive running like cowards paul thought but how else can i live to avenge my father he turned to face the door jessica heard him move said duncans dead paul you saw the wound you can do nothing for him ill take full payment for them all one day paul said not unless you hurry now kynes said paul felt the mans hand on his shoulder where will we meet kynes paul asked ill send fremen searching for you the storms path is known hurry now and the great mother give you speed and luck they heard him go a scrambling in the blackness jessica found pauls hand pulled him gently we must not get separated she said yes he followed her across the first arrow seeing it go black as they touched it another arrow beckoned ahead they crossed it saw it extinguish itself saw another arrow ahead they were running now plans within plans within plans within plans jessica thought have we become part of someone elses plan now the arrows led them around turnings past side openings only dimly sensed in the faint luminescence their way slanted downward for a time then up ever up they came finally to steps rounded a corner and were brought short by a glowing wall with a dark handle visible in its center paul pressed the handle the wall swung away from them light flared to reveal a rockhewn cavern with an ornithopter squatting in its center a flat gray wall with a doorsign on it loomed beyond the aircraft where did kynes go jessica asked he did what any good guerrilla leader would paul said he separated us into two parties and arranged that he couldnt reveal where we are if hes captured he wont really know paul drew her into the room noting how their feet kicked up dust on the floor no ones been here for a long time he said he seemed confident the fremen could find us she said i share that confidence paul released her hand crossed to the ornithopters left door opened it and secured his pack in the rear this ships proximity masked he said instrument panel has remote door control light control eighty years under the harkonnens taught them to be thorough jessica leaned against the crafts other side catching her breath the harkonnens will have a covering force over this area she said theyre not stupid she considered her direction sense pointed right the storm we saw is that way paul nodded fighting an abrupt reluctance to move he knew its cause but found no help in the knowledge somewhere this night he had passed a decisionnexus into the deep unknown he knew the timearea surrounding them but the hereandnow existed as a place of mystery it was as though he had seen himself from a distance go out of sight down into a valley of the countless paths up out of that valley some might carry a paul atreides back into sight but many would not the longer we wait the better prepared theyll be jessica said get in and strap yourself down he said he joined her in the ornithopter still wrestling with the thought that this was blind ground unseen in any prescient vision and he realized with an abrupt sense of shock that he had been giving more and more reliance to prescient memory and it had weakened him for this particular emergency if you rely only on your eyes your other senses weaken it was a bene gesserit axiom he took it to himself now promising never again to fall into that trap if he lived through this paul fastened his safety harness saw that his mother was secure checked the aircraft the wings were at full spreadrest their delicate metal interleavings extended he touched the retractor bar watched the wings shorten for jetboost takeoff the way gurney halleck had taught him the starter switch moved easily dials on the instrument panel came alive as the jetpods were armed turbines began their low hissing ready he asked yes he touched the remote control for lights darkness blanketed them his hand was a shadow against the luminous dials as he tripped the remote door control grating sounded ahead of them a cascade of sand swished away to silence a dusty breeze touched pauls cheeks he closed his door feeling the sudden pressure a wide patch of dustblurred stars framed in angular darkness appeared where the doorwall had been starlight defined a shelf beyond a suggestion of sand ripples paul depressed the glowing actionsequence switch on his panel the wings snapped back and down hurling the thopter out of its nest power surged from the jetpods as the wings locked into lift attitude jessica let her hands ride lightly on the dual controls feeling the sureness of her sons movements she was frightened yet exhilarated now pauls training is our only hope she thought his youth and swiftness paul fed more power to the jetpods the thopter banked sinking them into their seats as a dark wall lifted against the stars ahead he gave the craft more wing more power another burst of lifting wingbeats and they came out over rocks silverfrosted angles and outcroppings in the starlight the dustreddened second moon showed itself above the horizon to their right defining the ribbon trail of the storm pauls hands danced over the controls wings snicked in to beetle stubs gforce pulled at their flesh as the craft came around in a tight bank jetflares behind us jessica said i saw them he slammed the power arm forward their thopter leaped like a frightened animal surged southwest toward the storm and the great curve of desert in the near distance paul saw scattered shadows telling where the line of rocks ended the basement complex sinking beneath the dunes beyond stretched moonlit fingernail shadowsdunes diminishing one into another and above the horizon climbed the flat immensity of the storm like a wall against the stars something jarred the thopter shellburst jessica gasped theyre using some kind of projectile weapon she saw a sudden animal grin on pauls face they seem to be avoiding their lasguns he said but weve no shields do they know that again the thopter shuddered paul twisted to peer back only one of them appears to be fast enough to keep up with us he returned his attention to their course watching the storm wall grow high in front of them it loomed like a tangible solid projectile launchers rockets all the ancient weaponrythats one thing well give the fremen paul whispered the storm jessica said hadnt you better turn what about the ship behind us hes pulling up now paul stubbed the wings banked hard left into the deceptively slow boiling of the storm wall felt his cheeks pull in the gforce they appeared to glide into a slow clouding of dust that grew heavier and heavier until it blotted out the desert and the moon the aircraft became a long horizontal whisper of darkness lighted only by the green luminosity of the instrument panel through jessicas mind flashed all the warnings about such stormsthat they cut metal like butter etched flesh to bone and ate away the bones she felt the buffeting of dustblanketed wind it twisted them as paul fought the controls she saw him chop the power felt the ship buck the metal around them hissed and trembled sand jessica shouted she saw the negative shake of his head in the light from the panel not much sand this high but she could feel them sinking deeper into the maelstrom paul sent the wings to their full soaring length heard them creak with the strain he kept his eyes fixed on the instruments gliding by instinct fighting for altitude the sound of their passage diminished the thopter began rolling off to the left paul focused on the glowing globe within the attitude curve fought his craft back to level flight jessica had the eerie feeling that they were standing still that all motion was external a vague tan flowing against the windows a rumbling hiss reminded her of the powers around them winds to seven or eight hundred kilometers an hour she thought adrenaline edginess gnawed at her i must not fear she told herself mouthing the words of the bene gesserit litany fear is the mindkiller slowly her long years of training prevailed calmness returned we have the tiger by the tail paul whispered we cant go down cant land and i dont think i can lift us out of this well have to ride it out calmness drained out of her jessica felt her teeth chattering clamped them together then she heard pauls voice low and controlled reciting the litany fear is the mindkiller fear is the little death that brings total obliteration i will face my fear i will permit it to pass over me and through me and when it has gone past me i will turn to see fears path where the fear has gone there will be nothing only i will remain what do you despise by this are you truly known from manual of muaddib by the princess irulan they are dead baron said iakin nefud the guard captain both the woman and the boy are certainly dead the baron vladimir harkonnen sat up in the sleep suspensors of his private quarters beyond these quarters and enclosing him like a multishelled egg stretched the space frigate he had grounded on arrakis here in his quarters though the ships harsh metal was disguised with draperies with fabric paddings and rare art objects it is a certainty the guard captain said they are dead the baron shifted his gross body in the suspensors focused his attention on an ebaline statue of a leaping boy in a niche across the room sleep faded from him he straightened the padded suspensor beneath the fat folds of his neck stared across the single glowglobe of his bedchamber to the doorway where captain nefud stood blocked by the pentashield theyre certainly dead baron the man repeated the baron noted the trace of semuta dullness in nefuds eyes it was obvious the man had been deep within the drugs rapture when he received this report and had stopped only to take the antidote before rushing here i have a full report nefud said let him sweat a little the baron thought one must always keep the tools of statecraft sharp and ready power and fearsharp and ready have you seen their bodies the baron rumbled nefud hesitated well mlord they were seen to dive into a sandstorm winds over eight hundred kilometers nothing survives such a storm mlord nothing one of our own craft was destroyed in the pursuit the baron stared at nefud noting the nervous twitch in the scissors line of the mans jaw muscles the way the chin moved as nefud swallowed you have seen the bodies the baron asked mlord for what purpose do you come here rattling your armor the baron roared to tell me a thing is certain when it is not do you think ill praise you for such stupidity give you another promotion nefuds face went bone pale look at the chicken the baron thought i am surrounded by such useless clods if i scattered sand before this creature and told him it was grain hed peek at it the man idaho led us to them then the baron asked yes mlord look how he blurts out his answer the baron thought he said they were attempting to flee to the fremen eh yes mlord is there more to this report the imperial planetologist kynes is involved mlord idaho joined this kynes under mysterious circumstances i might even say suspicious circumstances so they ah fled together to a place in the desert where its apparent the boy and his mother were hiding in the excitement of the chase several of our groups were caught in a lasgunshield explosion how many did we lose im ah not sure yet mlord hes lying the baron thought it mustve been pretty bad the imperial lackey this kynes the baron said he was playing a double game eh id stake my reputation on it mlord his reputation have the man killed the baron said mlord kynes is the imperial planetologist his majestys own serv make it look like an accident then mlord there were sardaukar with our forces in the subjugation of this fremen nest they have kynes in custody now get him away from them say i wish to question him if they demur they will not if you handle it correctly nefud swallowed yes mlord the man must die the baron rumbled he tried to help my enemies nefud shifted from one foot to the other well mlord the sardaukar have two persons in custody who might be of interest to you theyve caught the dukes master of assassins hawat thufir hawat ive seen the captive myself mlord tis hawat id notve believed it possible they say he was knocked out by a stunner mlord in the desert where he couldnt use his shield hes virtually unharmed if we can get our hands on him hell provide great sport this is a mentat you speak of the baron growled one doesnt waste a mentat has he spoken what does he say of his defeat could he know the extent of but no he has spoken only enough mlord to reveal his belief that the lady jessica was his betrayer ahhhhh the baron sank back thinking then youre sure its the lady jessica who attracts his anger he said it in my presence mlord let him think shes alive then but mlord be quiet i wish hawat treated kindly he must be told nothing of the late doctor yueh his true betrayer let it be said that doctor yueh died defending his duke in a way this may even be true we will instead feed his suspicions against the lady jessica mlord i dont the way to control and direct a mentat nefud is through his information false informationfalse results yes mlord but is hawat hungry thirsty mlord hawats still in the hands of the sardaukar yes indeed yes but the sardaukar will be as anxious to get information from hawat as i am ive noticed a thing about our allies nefud theyre not very devious politically i do believe this is a deliberate thing the emperor wants it that way yes i do believe it you will remind the sardaukar commander of my renown at obtaining information from reluctant subjects nefud looked unhappy yes mlord you will tell the sardaukar commander that i wish to question both hawat and this kynes at the same time playing one off against the other he can understand that much i think yes mlord and once we have them in our hands the baron nodded mlord the sardaukar will want an observer with you during any questioning im sure we can produce an emergency to draw off any unwanted observers nefud i understand mlord thats when kynes can have his accident both kynes and hawat will have accidents then nefud but only kynes will have a real accident its hawat i want yes ah yes nefud blinked swallowed he appeared about to ask a question but remained silent hawat will be given both food and drink the baron said treated with kindness with sympathy in his water you will administer the residual poison developed by the late piter de vries and you will see that the antidote becomes a regular part of hawats diet from this point on unless i say otherwise the antidote yes nefud shook his head but dont be dense nefud the duke almost killed me with that poisoncapsule tooth the gas he exhaled into my presence deprived me of my most valuable mentat piter i need a replacement hawat hawat but youre going to say hawats completely loyal to the atreides true but the atreides are dead we will woo him he must be convinced hes not to blame for the dukes demise it was all the doing of that bene gesserit witch he had an inferior master one whose reason was clouded by emotion mentats admire the ability to calculate without emotion nefud we will woo the formidable thufir hawat woo him yes mlord hawat unfortunately had a master whose resources were poor one who could not elevate a mentat to the sublime peaks of reasoning that are a mentats right hawat will see a certain element of truth in this the duke couldnt afford the most efficient spies to provide his mentat with the required information the baron stared at nefud let us never deceive ourselves nefud the truth is a powerful weapon we know how we overwhelmed the atreides hawat knows too we did it with wealth with wealth yes mlord we will woo hawat the baron said we will hide him from the sardaukar and we will hold in reserve the withdrawal of the antidote for the poison theres no way of removing the residual poison and nefud hawat need never suspect the antidote will not betray itself to a poison snooper hawat can scan his food as he pleases and detect no trace of poison nefuds eyes opened wide with understanding the absence of a thing the baron said this can be as deadly as the presence the absence of air eh the absence of water the absence of anything else were addicted to the baron nodded you understand me nefud nefud swallowed yes mlord then get busy find the sardaukar commander and set things in motion at once mlord nefud bowed turned and hurried away hawat by my side the baron thought the sardaukar will give him to me if they suspect anything at all its that i wish to destroy the mentat and this suspicion ill confirm the fools one of the most formidable mentats in all history a mentat trained to kill and theyll toss him to me like some silly toy to be broken i will show them what use can be made of such a toy the baron reached beneath a drapery beside his suspensor bed pressed a button to summon his older nephew rabban he sat back smiling and all the atreides dead the stupid guard captain had been right of course certainly nothing survived in the path of a sandblast storm on arrakis not an ornithopter or its occupants the woman and the boy were dead the bribes in the right places the unthinkable expenditure to bring overwhelming military force down onto one planet all the sly reports tailored for the emperors ears alone all the careful scheming were here at last coming to full fruition power and fearfear and power the baron could see the path ahead of him one day a harkonnen would be emperor not himself and no spawn of his loins but a harkonnen not this rabban hed summoned of course but rabbans younger brother young feydrautha there was a sharpness to the boy that the baron enjoyed a ferocity a lovely boy the baron thought a year or two moresay by the time hes seventeen ill know for certain whether hes the tool that house harkonnen requires to gain the throne mlord baron the man who stood outside the doorfield of the barons bedchamber was low built gross of face and body with the harkonnen paternal lines narrowset eyes and bulge of shoulders there was yet some rigidity in his fat but it was obvious to the eye that hed come one day to the portable suspensors for carrying his excess weight a muscleminded tankbrain the baron thought no mentat my nephew not a piter de vries but perhaps something more precisely devised for the task at hand if i give him freedom to do it hell grind over everything in his path oh how hell be hated here on arrakis my dear rabban the baron said he released the doorfield but pointedly kept his body shield at full strength knowing that the shimmer of it would be visible above the bedside glowglobe you summoned me rabban said he stepped into the room flicked a glance past the air disturbance of the body shield searched for a suspensor chair found none stand closer where i can see you easily the baron said rabban advanced another step thinking that the damnable old man had deliberately removed all chairs forcing a visitor to stand the atreides are dead the baron said the last of them thats why i summoned you here to arrakis this planet is again yours rabban blinked but i thought you were going to advance piter de vries to the piter too is dead piter piter the baron reactivated the doorfield blanked it against all energy penetration you finally tired of him eh rabban asked his voice fell flat and lifeless in the energyblanketed room i will say a thing to you just this once the baron rumbled you insinuate that i obliterated piter as one obliterates a trifle he snapped fat fingers just like that eh i am not so stupid nephew i will take it unkindly if ever again you suggest by word or action that i am so stupid fear showed in the squinting of rabbans eyes he knew within certain limits how far the old baron would go against family seldom to the point of death unless there were outrageous profit or provocation in it but family punishments could be painful forgive me mlord baron rabban said he lowered his eyes as much to hide his own anger as to show subservience you do not fool me rabban the baron said rabban kept his eyes lowered swallowed i make a point the baron said never obliterate a man unthinkingly the way an entire fief might do it through some due process of law always do it for an overriding purposeand know your purpose anger spoke in rabban but you obliterated the traitor yueh i saw his body being carried out as i arrived last night rabban stared at his uncle suddenly frightened by the sound of those words but the baron smiled im very careful about dangerous weapons he said doctor yueh was a traitor he gave me the duke strength poured into the barons voice i suborned a doctor of the suk school the inner school you hear boy but thats a wild sort of weapon to leave lying about i didnt obliterate him casually does the emperor know you suborned a suk doctor this was a penetrating question the baron thought have i misjudged this nephew the emperor doesnt know it yet the baron said but his sardaukar are sure to report it to him before that happens though ill have my own report in his hands through choam company channels i will explain that i luckily discovered a doctor who pretended to the conditioning a false doctor you understand since everyone knows you can not counter the conditioning of a suk school this will be accepted ahhh i see rabban murmured and the baron thought indeed i hope you do see i hope you do see how vital it is that this remain secret the baron suddenly wondered at himself why did i do that why did i boast to this fool nephew of minethe nephew i must use and discard the baron felt anger at himself he felt betrayed it must be kept secret rabban said i understand the baron sighed i give you different instructions about arrakis this time nephew when last you ruled this place i held you in strong rein this time i have only one requirement mlord income income have you any idea rabban how much we spent to bring such military force to bear on the atreides do you have even the first inkling of how much the guild charges for military transport expensive eh expensive the baron shot a fat arm toward rabban if you squeeze arrakis for every cent it can give us for sixty years youll just barely repay us rabban opened his mouth closed it without speaking expensive the baron sneered the damnable guild monopoly on space wouldve ruined us if i hadnt planned for this expense long ago you should know rabban that we bore the entire brunt of it we even paid for transport of the sardaukar and not for the first time the baron wondered if there ever would come a day when the guild might be circumvented they were insidiousbleeding off just enough to keep the host from objecting until they had you in their fist where they could force you to pay and pay and pay always the exorbitant demands rode upon military ventures hazard rates the oily guild agents explained and for every agent you managed to insert as a watchdog in the guild bank structure they put two agents into your system insufferable income then rabban said the baron lowered his arm made a fist you must squeeze and i may do anything i wish as long as i squeeze anything the cannons you brought rabban said could i im removing them the baron said but you you wont need such toys they were a special innovation and are now useless we need the metal they can not go against a shield rabban they were merely the unexpected it was predictable that the dukes men would retreat into cliff caves on this abominable planet our cannon merely sealed them in the fremen dont use shields you may keep some lasguns if you wish yes m lord and i have a free hand as long as you squeeze rabbans smile was gloating i understand perfectly mlord you understand nothing perfectly the baron growled let us have that clear at the outset what you do understand is how to carry out my orders has it occurred to you nephew that there are at least five million persons on this planet does mlord forget that i was his regentsiridar here before and if mlord will forgive me his estimate may be low its difficult to count a population scattered among sinks and pans the way they are here and when you consider the fremen of the fremen arent worth considering forgive me mlord but the sardaukar believe otherwise the baron hesitated staring at his nephew you know something mlord had retired when i arrived last night i ah took the liberty of contacting some of my lieutenants from ah before theyve been acting as guides to the sardaukar they report that a fremen band ambushed a sardaukar force somewhere southeast of here and wiped it out wiped out a sardaukar force yes mlord impossible rabban shrugged fremen defeating sardaukar the baron sneered i repeat only what was reported to me rabban said it is said this fremen force already had captured the dukes redoubtable thufir hawat ahhhhhh the baron nodded smiling i believe the report rabban said youve no idea what a problem the fremen were perhaps but these werent fremen your lieutenants saw they mustve been atreides men trained by hawat and disguised as fremen its the only possible answer again rabban shrugged well the sardaukar think they were fremen the sardaukar already have launched a program to wipe out all fremen good but itll keep the sardaukar occupied and well soon have hawat i know it i can feel it ah this has been a day the sardaukar off hunting a few useless desert bands while we get the real prize mlord rabban hesitated frowning ive always felt that we underestimated the fremen both in numbers and in ignore them boy theyre rabble its the populous towns cities and villages that concern us a great many people there eh a great many mlord they worry me rabban worry you oh ninety per cent of them are of no concern but there are always a few houses minor and so on people of ambition who might try a dangerous thing if one of them should get off arrakis with an unpleasant story about what happened here id be most displeased have you any idea how displeased id be rabban swallowed you must take immediate measures to hold a hostage from each house minor the baron said as far as anyone off arrakis must learn this was straightforward housetohouse battle the sardaukar had no part in it you understand the duke was offered the usual quarter and exile but he died in an unfortunate accident before he could accept he was about to accept though that is the story and any rumor that there were sardaukar here it must be laughed at as the emperor wishes it rabban said as the emperor wishes it what about the smugglers no one believes smugglers rabban they are tolerated but not believed at any rate youll be spreading some bribes in that quarter and taking other measures which im sure you can think of yes mlord two things from arrakis then rabban income and a merciless fist you must show no mercy here think of these clods as what they areslaves envious of their masters and waiting only the opportunity to rebel not the slightest vestige of pity or mercy must you show them can one exterminate an entire planet rabban asked exterminate surprise showed in the swift turning of the barons head who said anything about exterminating well i presumed you were going to bring in new stock and i said squeeze nephew not exterminate dont waste the population merely drive them into utter submission you must be the carnivore my boy he smiled a babys expression in the dimplefat face a carnivore never stops show no mercy never stop mercy is a chimera it can be defeated by the stomach rumbling its hunger by the throat crying its thirst you must be always hungry and thirsty the baron caressed his bulges beneath the suspensors like me i see mlord rabban swung his gaze left and right its all clear then nephew except for one thing uncle the planetologist kynes ah yes kynes hes the emperors man mlord he can come and go as he pleases and hes very close to the fremen married one kynes will be dead by tomorrows nightfall thats dangerous work uncle killing an imperial servant how do you think ive come this far this quickly the baron demanded his voice was low charged with unspeakable adjectives besides you need never have feared kynes would leave arrakis youre forgetting that hes addicted to the spice of course those who know will do nothing to endanger their supply the baron said kynes certainly must know i forgot rabban said they stared at each other in silence presently the baron said incidentally you will make my own supply one of your first concerns ive quite a stockpile of private stuff but that suicide raid by the dukes men got most of what wed stored for sale rabban nodded yes mlord the baron brightened now tomorrow morning you will assemble what remains of organization here and youll say to them our sublime padishah emperor has charged me to take possession of this planet and end all dispute i understand mlord this time im sure you do we will discuss it in more detail tomorrow now leave me to finish my sleep the baron deactivated his doorfield watched his nephew out of sight a tankbrain the baron thought muscleminded tankbrain they will be bloody pulp here when hes through with them then when i send in feydrautha to take the load off them theyll cheer their rescuer beloved feydrautha benign feydrautha the compassionate one who saves them from a beast feydrautha a man to follow and die for the boy will know by that time how to oppress with impunity im sure hes the one we need hell learn and such a lovely body really a lovely boy at the age of fifteen he had already learned silence from a childs history of muaddib by the princess irulan as paul fought the thopters controls he grew aware that he was sorting out the interwoven storm forces his more than mentat awareness computing on the basis of fractional minutiae he felt dust fronts billowings mixings of turbulence an occasional vortex the cabin interior was an angry box lighted by the green radiance of instrument dials the tan flow of dust outside appeared featureless but his inner sense began to see through the curtain i must find the right vortex he thought for a long time now he had sensed the storms power diminishing but still it shook them he waited out another turbulence the vortex began as an abrupt billowing that rattled the entire ship paul defied all fear to bank the thopter left jessica saw the maneuver on the attitude globe paul she screamed the vortex turned them twisting tipping it lifted the thopter like a chip on a geyser spewed them up and outa winged speck within a core of winding dust lighted by the second moon paul looked down saw the dustdefined pillar of hot wind that had disgorged them saw the dying storm trailing away like a dry river into the desertmoongray motion growing smaller and smaller below as they rode the updraft were out of it jessica whispered paul turned their craft away from the dust in swooping rhythm while he scanned the night sky weve given them the slip he said jessica felt her heart pounding she forced herself to calmness looked at the diminishing storm her time sense said they had ridden within that compounding of elemental forces almost four hours but part of her mind computed the passage as a lifetime she felt reborn it was like the litany she thought we faced it and did not resist the storm passed through us and around us its gone but we remain i dont like the sound of our wing motion paul said we suffered some damage in there he felt the grating injured flight through his hands on the controls they were out of the storm but still not out into the full view of his prescient vision yet they had escaped and paul sensed himself trembling on the verge of a revelation he shivered the sensation was magnetic and terrifying and he found himself caught on the question of what caused this trembling awareness part of it he felt was the spicesaturated diet of arrakis but he thought part of it could be the litany as though the words had a power of their own i shall not fear cause and effect he was alive despite malignant forces and he felt himself poised on a brink of selfawareness that could not have been without the litanys magic words from the orange catholic bible rang through his memory what senses do we lack that we can not see or hear another world all around us theres rock all around jessica said paul focused on the thopters launching shook his head to clear it he looked where his mother pointed saw uplifting rock shapes black on the sand ahead and to the right he felt wind around his ankles a stirring of dust in the cabin there was a hole somewhere more of the storms doing better set us down on sand jessica said the wings might not take full brake he nodded toward a place ahead where sandblasted ridges lifted into moonlight above the dunes ill set us down near those rocks check your safety harness she obeyed thinking weve water and stillsuits if we can find food we can survive a long time on this desert fremen live here what they can do we can do run for those rocks the instant were stopped paul said ill take the pack run for she fell silent nodded worms our friends the worms he corrected her theyll get this thopter therell be no evidence of where we landed how direct his thinking she thought they glided lower lower there came a rushing sense of motion to their passageblurred shadows of dunes rocks lifting like islands the thopter touched a dune top with a soft lurch skipped a sand valley touched another dune hes killing our speed against the sand jessica thought and permitted herself to admire his competence brace yourself paul warned he pulled back on the wing brakes gently at first then harder and harder he felt them cup the air their aspect ratio dropping faster and faster wind screamed through the lapped coverts and primaries of the wings leaves abruptly with only the faintest lurch of warning the left wing weakened by the storm twisted upward and in slamming across the side of the thopter the craft skidded across a dune top twisting to the left it tumbled down the opposite face to bury its nose in the next dune amid a cascade of sand they lay stopped on the broken wing side the right wing pointing toward the stars paul jerked off his safety harness hurled himself upward across his mother wrenching the door open sand poured around them into the cabin bringing a dry smell of burned flint he grabbed the pack from the rear saw that his mother was free of her harness she stepped up onto the side of the righthand seat and out onto the thopters metal skin paul followed dragging the pack by its straps run he ordered he pointed up the dune face and beyond it where they could see a rock tower undercut by sandblast winds jessica leaped off the thopter and ran scrambling and sliding up the dune she heard pauls panting progress behind they came out onto a sand ridge that curved away toward the rocks follow the ridge paul ordered itll be faster they slogged toward the rocks sand gripping their feet a new sound began to impress itself on them a muted whisper a hissing an abrasive slithering worm paul said it grew louder faster paul gasped the first rock shingle like a beach slanting from the sand lay no more than ten meters ahead when they heard metal crunch and shatter behind them paul shifted his pack to his right arm holding it by the straps it slapped his side as he ran he took his mothers arm with his other hand they scrambled onto the lifting rock up a pebblelittered surface through a twisted windcarved channel breath came dry and gasping in their throats i cant run any farther jessica panted paul stopped pressed her into a gut of rock turned and looked down onto the desert a moundinmotion ran parallel to their rock islandmoonlit ripples sand waves a cresting burrow almost level with pauls eyes at a distance of about a kilometer the flattened dunes of its track curved oncea short loop crossing the patch of desert where they had abandoned their wrecked ornithopter where the worm had been there was no sign of the aircraft the burrow mound moved outward into the desert coursed back across its own path questing its bigger than a guild spaceship paul whispered i was told worms grew large in the deep desert but i didnt realize how big nor i jessica breathed again the thing turned out away from the rocks sped now with a curving track toward the horizon they listened until the sound of its passage was lost in gentle sand stirrings around them paul took a deep breath looked up at the moonfrosted escarpment and quoted from the kitab alibar travel by night and rest in black shade through the day he looked at his mother we still have a few hours of night can you go on in a moment paul stepped out onto the rock shingle shouldered the pack and adjusted its straps he stood a moment with a paracompass in his hands whenever youre ready he said she pushed herself away from the rock feeling her strength return which direction where this ridge leads he pointed deep into the desert she said the fremen desert paul whispered and he paused shaken by the remembered high relief imagery of a prescient vision he had experienced on caladan he had seen this desert but the set of the vision had been subtly different like an optical image that had disappeared into his consciousness been absorbed by memory and now failed of perfect registry when projected onto the real scene the vision appeared to have shifted and approached him from a different angle while he remained motionless idaho was with us in the vision he remembered but now idaho is dead do you see a way to go jessica asked mistaking his hesitation no he said but well go anyway he settled his shoulders more firmly in the pack struck out up a sandcarved channel in the rock the channel opened onto a moonlit floor of rock with benched ledges climbing away to the south paul headed for the first ledge clambered onto it jessica followed she noted presently how their passage became a matter of the immediate and particularthe sand pockets between rocks where their steps were slowed the windcarved ridge that cut their hands the obstruction that forced a choice go over or go around the terrain enforced its own rhythms they spoke only when necessary and then with the hoarse voices of their exertion careful herethis ledge is slippery with sand watch you dont hit your head against this overhang stay below this ridge the moons at our backs and itd show our movement to anyone out there paul stopped in a bight of rock leaned the pack against a narrow ledge jessica leaned beside him thankful for the moment of rest she heard paul pulling at his stillsuit tube sipped her own reclaimed water it tasted brackish and she remembered the waters of caladana tall fountain enclosing a curve of sky such a richness of moisture that it hadnt been noticed for itself only for its shape or its reflection or its sound as she stopped beside it to stop she thought to rest truly rest it occurred to her that mercy was the ability to stop if only for a moment there was no mercy where there could be no stopping paul pushed away from the rock ledge turned and climbed over a sloping surface jessica followed with a sigh they slid down onto a wide shelf that led around a sheer rock face again they fell into the disjointed rhythm of movement across this broken land jessica felt that the night was dominated by degrees of smallness in substances beneath their feet and handsboulders or pea gravel or flaked rock or pea sand or sand itself or grit or dust or gossamer powder the powder clogged nose filters and had to be blown out pea sand and pea gravel rolled on a hard surface and could spill the unwary rock flakes cut and the omnipresent sand patches dragged against their feet paul stopped abruptly on a rock shelf steadied his mother as she stumbled into him he was pointing left and she looked along his arm to see that they stood atop a cliff with the desert stretched out like a static ocean some two hundred meters below it lay there full of moonsilvered wavesshadows of angles that lapsed into curves and in the distance lifted to the misted gray blur of another escarpment open desert she said a wide place to cross paul said and his voice was muffled by the filter trap across his face jessica glanced left and rightnothing but sand below paul stared straight ahead across the open dunes watching the movement of shadows in the moons passage about three or four kilometers across he said worms she said sure to be she focused on her weariness the muscle ache that dulled her senses shall we rest and eat paul slipped out of the pack sat down and leaned against it jessica supported herself by a hand on his shoulder as she sank to the rock beside him she felt paul turn as she settled herself heard him scrabbling in the pack here he said his hand felt dry against hers as he pressed two energy capsules into her palm she swallowed them with a grudging spit of water from her stillsuit tube drink all your water paul said axiom the best place to conserve your water is in your body it keeps your energy up youre stronger trust your stillsuit she obeyed drained her catchpockets feeling energy return she thought then how peaceful it was here in this moment of their tiredness and she recalled once hearing the minstrelwarrior gurney halleck say better a dry morsel and quietness therewith than a house full of sacrifice and strife jessica repeated the words to paul that was gurney he said she caught the tone of his voice the way he spoke as of someone dead thought and well poor gurney might be dead the atreides forces were either dead or captive or lost like themselves in this waterless void gurney always had the right quotation paul said i can hear him now and i will make the rivers dry and sell the land into the hand of the wicked and i will make the land waste and all that is therein by the hand of strangers jessica closed her eyes found herself moved close to tears by the pathos in her sons voice presently paul said how do you feel she recognized that his question was directed at her pregnancy said your sister wont be born for many months yet i still feel physically adequate and she thought how stiffly formal i speak to my own son then because it was the bene gesserit way to seek within for the answer to such an oddity she searched and found the source of her formality im afraid of my son i fear his strangeness i fear what he may see ahead of us what he may tell me paul pulled his hood down over his eyes listened to the bughustling sounds of the night his lungs were charged with his own silence his nose itched he rubbed it removed the filter and grew conscious of the rich smell of cinnamon theres melange spice nearby he said an eider wind feathered pauls cheeks ruffled the folds of his burnoose but this wind carried no threat of storm already he could sense the difference dawn soon he said jessica nodded theres a way to get safely across that open sand paul said the fremen do it the worms if we were to plant a thumper from our fremkit back in the rocks here paul said itd keep a worm occupied for a time she glanced at the stretch of moonlighted desert between them and the other escarpment four kilometers worth of time perhaps and if we crossed there making only natural sounds the kind that dont attract the worms paul studied the open desert questing in his prescient memory probing the mysterious allusions to thumpers and maker hooks in the fremkit manual that had come with their escape pack he found it odd that all he sensed was pervasive terror at thought of the worms he knew as though it lay just at the edge of his awareness that the worms were to be respected and not feared if if he shook his head itd have to be sounds without rhythm jessica said what oh yes if we broke our steps the sand itself must shift down at times worms cant investigate every little sound we should be fully rested before we try it though he looked across at that other rock wall seeing the passage of time in the vertical moonshadows there itll be dawn within the hour wherell we spend the day she asked paul turned left pointed the cliff curves back north over there you can see by the way its windcut thats the windward face therell be crevasses there deep ones had we better get started she asked he stood helped her to her feet are you rested enough for a climb down i want to get as close as possible to the desert floor before we camp enough she nodded for him to lead the way he hesitated then lifted the pack settled it onto his shoulders and turned along the cliff if only we had suspensors jessica thought itd be such a simple matter to jump down there but perhaps suspensors are another thing to avoid in the open desert maybe they attract the worms the way a shield does they came to a series of shelves dropping down and beyond them saw a fissure with its ledge outlined by moonshadow leading along the vestibule paul led the way down moving cautiously but hurrying because it was obvious the moonlight could not last much longer they wound down into a world of deeper and deeper shadows hints of rock shape climbed to the stars around them the fissure narrowed to some ten meters width at the brink of a dim gray sandslope that slanted downward into darkness can we do down jessica whispered i think so he tested the surface with one foot we can slide down he said ill go first wait until you hear me stop careful she said he stepped onto the slope and slid and slipped down its soft surface onto an almost level floor of packed sand the place was deep within the rock walls there came the sound of sand sliding behind him he tried to see up the slope in the darkness was almost knocked over by the cascade it trailed away to silence mother he said there was no answer mother he dropped the pack hurled himself up the slope scrambling digging throwing sand like a wild man mother he gasped mother where are you another cascade of sand swept down on him burying him to the hips he wrenched himself out of it shes been caught in the sandslide he thought buried in it i must be calm and work this out carefully she wont smother immediately shell compose herself in bindu suspension to reduce her oxygen needs she knows ill dig for her in the bene gesserit way she had taught him paul stilled the savage beating of his heart set his mind as a blank slate upon which the past few moments could write themselves every partial shift and twist of the slide replayed itself in his memory moving with an interior stateliness that contrasted with the fractional second of real time required for the total recall presently paul moved slantwise up the slope probing cautiously until he found the wall of the fissure an outcurve of rock there he began to dig moving the sand with care not to dislodge another slide a piece of fabric came under his hands he followed it found an arm gently he traced the arm exposed her face do you hear me he whispered no answer he dug faster freed her shoulders she was limp beneath his hands but he detected a slow heartbeat bindu suspension he told himself he cleared the sand away to her waist draped her arms over his shoulders and pulled downslope slowly at first then dragging her as fast as he could feeling the sand give way above faster and faster he pulled her gasping with the effort fighting to keep his balance he was out on the hardpacked floor of the fissure then swinging her to his shoulder and breaking into a staggering run as the entire sandslope came down with a loud hiss that echoed and was magnified within the rock walls he stopped at the end of the fissure where it looked out on the deserts marching dunes some thirty meters below gently he lowered her to the sand uttered the word to bring her out of the catalepsis she awakened slowly taking deeper and deeper breaths i knew youd find me she whispered he looked back up the fissure it might have been kinder if i hadnt paul i lost the pack he said its buried under a hundred tons of sand at least everything the spare water the stilltenteverything that counts he touched a pocket i still have the paracompass he fumbled at the waist sash knife and binoculars we can get a good look around the place where well die in that instant the sun lifted above the horizon somewhere to the left beyond the end of the fissure colors blinked in the sand out on the open desert a chorus of birds held forth their songs from hidden places among the rocks but jessica had eyes only for the despair in pauls face she edged her voice with scorn said is this the way you were taught dont you understand he asked everything we need to survive in this place is under that sand you found me she said and now her voice was soft reasonable paul squatted back on his heels presently he looked up the fissure at the new slope studying it marking the looseness of the sand if we could immobilize a small area of that slope and the upper face of a hole dug into the sand we might be able to put down a shaft to the pack water might do it but we dont have enough water for he broke off then foam jessica held herself to stillness lest she disturb the hyperfunctioning of his mind paul looked out at the open dunes searching with his nostrils as well as his eyes finding the direction and then centering his attention on a darkened patch of sand below them spice he said its essencehighly alkaline and i have the paracompass its power pack is acidbase jessica sat up straight against the rock paul ignored her leaped to his feet and was off down the windcompacted surface that spilled from the end of the fissure to the deserts floor she watched the way he walked breaking his stridestep pause stepstep slide pause there was no rhythm to it that might tell a marauding worm something not of the desert moved here paul reached the spice patch shoveled a mound of it into a fold of his robe returned to the fissure he spilled the spice onto the sand in front of jessica squatted and began dismantling the paracompass using the point of his knife the compass face came off he removed his sash spread the compass parts on it lifted out the power pack the dial mechanism came out next leaving an empty dished compartment in the instrument youll need water jessica said paul took the catchtube from his neck sucked up a mouthful expelled it into the dished compartment if this fails thats water wasted jessica thought but it wont matter then anyway with his knife paul cut open the power pack spilled its crystals into the water they foamed slightly subsided jessicas eyes caught motion above them she looked up to see a line of hawks along the rim of the fissure they perched there staring down at the open water great mother she thought they can sense water even at that distance paul had the cover back on the paracompass leaving off the reset button which gave a small hole into the liquid taking the reworked instrument in one hand a handful of spice in the other paul went back up the fissure studying the lay of the slope his robe billowed gently without the sash to hold it he waded part way up the slope kicking off sand rivulets spurts of dust presently he stopped pressed a pinch of the spice into the paracompass shook the instrument case green foam boiled out of the hole where the reset button had been paul aimed it at the slope spread a low dike there began kicking away the sand beneath it immobilizing the opened face with more foam jessica moved to a position below him called out may i help come up and dig he said weve about three meters to go its going to be a near thing as he spoke the foam stopped billowing from the instrument quickly paul said no telling how long this foam will hold the sand jessica scrambled up beside paul as he sifted another pinch of spice into the hole shook the paracompass case again foam boiled from it as paul directed the foam barrier jessica dug with her hands hurling the sand down the slope how deep she panted about three meters he said and i can only approximate the position we may have to widen this hole he moved a step aside slipping in loose sand slant your digging backward dont go straight down jessica obeyed slowly the hole went down reaching a level even with the floor of the basin and still no sign of the pack could i have miscalculated paul asked himself im the one that panicked originally and caused this mistake has that warped my ability he looked at the paracompass less than two ounces of the acid infusion remained jessica straightened in the hole rubbed a foamstained hand across her cheek her eyes met pauls the upper face paul said gently now he added another pinch of spice to the container sent the foam boiling around jessicas hands as she began cutting a vertical face in the upper slant of the hole on the second pass her hands encountered something hard slowly she worked out a length of strap with a plastic buckle dont move any more of it paul said and his voice was almost a whisper were out of foam jessica held the strap in one hand looked up at him paul threw the empty paracompass down onto the floor of the basin said give me your other hand now listen carefully im going to pull you to the side and downhill dont let go of that strap we wont get much more spill from the top this slope has stabilized itself all im going to aim for is to keep your head free of the sand once that holes filled we can dig you out and pull up the pack i understand she said ready ready she tensed her fingers on the strap with one surge paul had her half out of the hole holding her head up as the foam barrier gave way and sand spilled down when it had subsided jessica remained buried to the waist her left arm and shoulder still under the sand her chin protected on a fold of pauls robe her shoulder ached from the strain put on it i still have the strap she said slowly paul worked his hand into the sand beside her found the strap together he said steady pressure we mustnt break it more sand spilled down as they worked the pack up when the strap cleared the surface paul stopped freed his mother from the sand together then they pulled the pack downslope and out of its trap in a few minutes they stood on the floor of the fissure holding the pack between them paul looked at his mother foam stained her face her robe sand was caked to her where the foam had dried she looked as though she had been a target for balls of wet green sand you look a mess he said youre not so pretty yourself she said they started to laugh then sobered that shouldnt have happened paul said i was careless she shrugged feeling caked sand fall away from her robe ill put up the tent he said better slip off that robe and shake it out he turned away taking the pack jessica nodded suddenly too tired to answer theres anchor holes in the rock paul said someones tented here before why not she thought as she brushed at her robe this was a likely placedeep in rock walls and facing another cliff some four kilometers awayfar enough above the desert to avoid worms but close enough for easy access before a crossing she turned seeing that paul had the tent up its ribdomed hemisphere blending with the rock walls of the fissure paul stepped past her lifting his binoculars he adjusted their internal pressure with a quick twist focused the oil lenses on the other cliff lifting golden tan in morning light across open sand jessica watched as he studied that apocalyptic landscape his eyes probing into sand rivers and canyons there are growing things over there he said jessica found the spare binoculars in the pack beside the tent moved up beside paul there he said holding the binoculars with one hand and pointing with the other she looked where he pointed saguaro she said scrawny stuff there may be people nearby paul said that could be the remains of a botanical testing station she warned this is pretty far south into the desert he said he lowered his binoculars rubbed beneath his filter baffle feeling how dry and chapped his lips were sensing the dusty taste of thirst in his mouth this has the feeling of a fremen place he said are we certain the fremen will be friendly she asked kynes promised their help but theres desperation in the people of this desert she thought i felt some of it myself today desperate people might kill us for our water she closed her eyes and against this wasteland conjured in her mind a scene from caladan there had been a vacation trip once on caladanshe and the duke leto before pauls birth theyd flown over the southern jungles above the weedwild shouting leaves and rice paddies of the deltas and they had seen the ant lines in the greenerymangangs carrying their loads on suspensorbuoyed shoulder poles and in the sea reaches thered been the white petals of trimaran dhows all of it gone jessica opened her eyes to the desert stillness to the mounting warmth of the day restless heat devils were beginning to set the air aquiver out on the open sand the other rock face across from them was like a thing seen through cheap glass a spill of sand spread its brief curtain across the open end of the fissure the sand hissed down loosed by puffs of morning breeze by the hawks that were beginning to lift away from the clifftop when the sandfall was gone she still heard it hissing it grew louder a sound that once heard was never forgotten worm paul whispered it came from their right with an uncaring majesty that could not be ignored a twisting burrowmound of sand cut through the dunes within their field of vision the mound lifted in front dusting away like a bow wave in water then it was gone coursing off to the left the sound diminished died ive seen space frigates that were smaller paul whispered she nodded continuing to stare across the desert where the worm had passed there remained that tantalizing gap it flowed bitterly endless before them beckoning beneath its horizontal collapse of skyline when weve rested jessica said we should continue with your lessons he suppressed a sudden anger said mother dont you think we could do without today you panicked she said you know your mind and bindunervature perhaps better than i do but youve much yet to learn about your bodys pranamusculature the body does things of itself sometimes paul and i can teach you about this you must learn to control every muscle every fiber of your body you need review of the hands well start with finger muscles palm tendons and tip sensitivity she turned away come into the tent now he flexed the fingers of his left hand watching her crawl through the sphincter valve knowing that he could not deflect her from this determination that he must agree whatever has been done to me ive been a party to it he thought review of the hand he looked at his hand how inadequate it appeared when measured against such creatures as that worm we came from caladana paradise world for our form of fife there existed no need on caladan to build a physical paradise or a paradise of the mindwe could see the actuality all around us and the price we paid was the price men have always paid for achieving a paradise in this lifewe went soft we lost our edge from muaddib conversations by the princess irulan so youre the great gurney halleck the man said halleck stood staring across the round cavern office at the smuggler seated behind a metal desk the man wore fremen robes and had the halftint blue eyes that told of offplanet foods in his diet the office duplicated a space frigates master control centercommunications and viewscreens along a thirtydegree arc of wall remote arming and firing banks adjoining and the desk formed as a wall projectionpart of the remaining curve i am staban tuek son of esmar tuek the smuggler said then youre the one i owe thanks for the help weve received halleck said ahhh gratitude the smuggler said sit down a shiptype bucket seat emerged from the wall beside the screens and halleck sank onto it with a sigh feeling his weariness he could see his own reflection now in a dark surface beside the smuggler and scowled at the lines of fatigue in his lumpy face the inkvine scar along his jaw writhed with the scowl halleck turned from his reflection stared at tuek he saw the family resemblance in the smuggler nowthe fathers heavy overhanging eyebrows and rock planes of cheeks and nose your men tell me your father is dead killed by the harkonnens halleck said by the harkonnens or by a traitor among your people tuek said anger overcame part of hallecks fatigue he straightened said can you name the traitor we are not sure thufir hawat suspected the lady jessica ahhh the bene gesserit witch perhaps but hawat is now a harkonnen captive i heard halleck took a deep breath it appears weve a deal more killing ahead of us we will do nothing to attract attention to us tuek said halleck stiffened but you and those of your men weve saved are welcome to sanctuary among us tuek said you speak of gratitude very well work off your debt to us we can always use good men well destroy you out of hand though if you make the slightest open move against the harkonnens but they killed your father man perhaps and if so ill give you my fathers answer to those who act without thinking a stone is heavy and the sand is weighty but a fools wrath is heavier than them both you mean to do nothing about it then halleck sneered you did not hear me say that i merely say i will protect our contract with the guild the guild requires that we play a circumspect game there are other ways of destroying a foe ahhhhh ah indeed if youve a mind to seek out the witch have at it but i warn you that youre probably too late and we doubt shes the one you want any way hawat made few mistakes he allowed himself to fall into harkonnen hands you think hes the traitor tuek shrugged this is academic we think the witch is dead at least the harkonnens believe it you seem to know a great deal about the harkonnens hints and suggestions rumors and hunches we are seventyfour men halleck said if you seriously wish us to enlist with you you must believe our duke is dead his body has been seen and the boy tooyoung master paul halleck tried to swallow found a lump in his throat according to the last word we had he was lost with his mother in a desert storm likely not even their bones will ever be found so the witch is dead then all dead tuek nodded and beast rabban so they say will sit once more in the seat of power here on dune the count rabban of lankiveil yes it took halleck a moment to put down the upsurge of rage that threatened to overcome him he spoke with panting breath ive a score of my own against rabban i owe him for the lives of my family he rubbed at the scar along his jaw and for this one does not risk everything to settle a score prematurely tuek said he frowned watching the play of muscles along hallecks jaw the sudden withdrawal in the mans shedlidded eyes i know i know halleck took a deep breath you and your men can work out your passage off arrakis by serving with us there are many places to i release my men from any bond to me they can choose for themselves with rabban herei stay in your mood im not sure we want you to stay halleck stared at the smuggler you doubt my word nooo youve saved me from the harkonnens i gave loyalty to the duke leto for no greater reason ill stay on arrakiswith you or with the fremen whether a thought is spoken or not it is a real thing and it has power tuek said you might find the line between life and death among the fremen to be too sharp and quick halleck closed his eyes briefly feeling the weariness surge up in him where is the lord who led us through the land of deserts and of pits he murmured move slowly and the day of your revenge will come tuek said speed is a device of shaitan cool your sorrowweve the diversions for it three things there are that ease the heartwater green grass and the beauty of woman halleck opened his eyes i would prefer the blood of rabban harkonnen flowing about my feet he stared at tuek you think that day will come i have little to do with how youll meet tomorrow gurney halleck i can only help you meet today then ill accept that help and stay until the day you tell me to revenge your father and all the others who listen to me fighting man tuek said he leaned forward over his desk his shoulders level with his ears eyes intent the smugglers face was suddenly like weathered stone my fathers waterill buy that back myself with my own blade halleck stared back at tuek in that moment the smuggler reminded him of duke leto a leader of men courageous secure in his own position and his own course he was like the duke before arrakis do you wish my blade beside you halleck asked tuek sat back relaxed studying halleck silently do you think of me as fighting man halleck pressed youre the only one of the dukes lieutenants to escape tuek said your enemy was overwhelming yet you rolled with him you defeated him the way we defeat arrakis eh we live on sufferance down here gurney halleck tuek said arrakis is our enemy one enemy at a time is that it thats it is that the way the fremen make out perhaps you said i might find life with the fremen too tough they live in the desert in the open is that why who knows where the fremen live for us the central plateau is a nomans land but i wish to talk more about im told that the guild seldom routes spice lighters in over the desert halleck said but there are rumors that you can see bits of greenery here and there if you know where to look rumors tuek sneered do you wish to choose now between me and the fremen we have a measure of security our own sietch carved out of the rock our own hidden basins we live the lives of civilized men the fremen are a few ragged bands that we use as spicehunters but they can kill harkonnens and do you wish to know the result even now they are being hunted down like animalswith lasguns because they have no shields they are being exterminated why because they killed harkonnens was it harkonnens they killed halleck asked what do you mean havent you heard that there mayve been sardaukar with the harkonnens more rumors but a pogromthat isnt like the harkonnens a pogrom is wasteful i believe what i see with my own eyes tuek said make your choice fighting man me or the fremen i will promise you sanctuary and a chance to draw the blood we both want be sure of that the fremen will offer you only the life of the hunted halleck hesitated sensing wisdom and sympathy in tueks words yet troubled for no reason he could explain trust your own abilities tuek said whose decisions brought your force through the battle yours decide it must be halleck said the duke and his son are dead the harkonnens believe it where such things are concerned i incline to trust the harkonnens a grim smile touched tueks mouth but its about the only trust i give them then it must be halleck repeated he held out his right hand palm up and thumb folded flat against it in the traditional gesture i give you my sword accepted do you wish me to persuade my men youd let them make their own decision theyve followed me this far but most are caladanborn arrakis isnt what they thought itd be here theyve lost everything except their lives id prefer they decided for themselves now now is no time for you to falter tuek said theyve followed you this far you need them is that it we can always use experienced fighting men in these times more than ever youve accepted my sword do you wish me to persuade them i think theyll follow you gurney halleck tis to be hoped indeed i may make my own decision in this then your own decision halleck pushed himself up from the bucket seat feeling how much of his reserve strength even that small effort required for now ill see to their quarters and wellbeing he said consult my quartermaster tuek said drisq is his name tell him its my wish that you receive every courtesy ill join you myself presently ive some offshipments of spice to see to first fortune passes everywhere halleck said everywhere tuek said a time of upset is a rare opportunity for our business halleck nodded heard the faint sussuration and felt the air shift as a lockport swung open beside him he turned ducked through it and out of the office he found himself in the assembly hall through which he and his men had been led by tueks aides it was a long fairly narrow area chewed out of the native rock its smooth surface betraying the use of cutteray burners for the job the ceiling stretched away high enough to continue the natural supporting curve of the rock and to permit internal airconvection currents weapons racks and lockers lined the walls halleck noted with a touch of pride that those of his men still able to stand were standingno relaxation in weariness and defeat for them smuggler medics were moving among them tending the wounded litter cases were assembled in one area down to the left each wounded man with an atreides companion the atreides trainingwe care for our ownit held like a core of native rock in them halleck noted one of his lieutenants stepped forward carrying hallecks ninestring baliset out of its case the man snapped a salute said sir the medics here say theres no hope for mattai they have no bone and organ banks hereonly outpost medicine mattai cant last they say and he has a request of you what is it the lieutenant thrust the baliset forward mattai wants a song to ease his going sir he says youll know the one hes asked it of you often enough the lieutenant swallowed its the one called my woman sir if you i know halleck took the baliset flicked the multipick out of its catch on the fingerboard he drew a soft chord from the instrument found that someone had already tuned it there was a burning in his eyes but he drove that out of his thoughts as he strolled forward strumming the tune forcing himself to smile casually several of his men and a smuggler medic were bent over one of the litters one of the men began singing softly as halleck approached catching the counterbeat with the ease of long familiarity my woman stands at her window curved lines gainst square glass upraisd arms bent downfolded gainst sunset red and golded come to me come to me warm arms of my lass for me for me the warm arms of my lass the singer stopped reached out a bandaged arm and closed the eyelids of the man on the litter halleck drew a final soft chord from the baliset thinking now we are seventythree family life of the royal creche is difficult for many people to understand but i shall try to give you a capsule view of it my father had only one real friend i think that was count hasimir fenring the geneticeunuch and one of the deadliest fighters in the imperium the count a dapper and ugly little man brought a new slaveconcubine to my father one day and i was dispatched by my mother to spy on the proceedings all of us spied on my father as a matter of selfprotection one of the slaveconcubines permitted my father under the bene gesseritguild agreement could not of course bear a royal successor but the intrigues were constant and oppressive in their similarity we became adept my mother and sisters and i at avoiding subtle instruments of death it may seem a dreadful thing to say but i m not at all sure my father was innocent in all these attempts a royal family is not like other families here was a new slaveconcubine then redhaired like my father willowy and graceful she had a dancers muscles and her training obviously had included neuroenticement my father looked at her for a long time as she postured unclothed before him finally he said she is too beautiful we will save her as a gift you have no idea how much consternation this restraint created in the royal creche subtlety and selfcontrol were after all the most deadly threats to us all in my fathers house by the princess irulan paul stood outside the stilltent in the late afternoon the crevasse where he had pitched their camp lay in deep shadow he stared out across the open sand at the distant cliff wondering if he should waken his mother who lay asleep in the tent folds upon folds of dunes spread beyond their shelter away from the setting sun the dunes exposed greased shadows so black they were like bits of night and the flatness his mind searched for something tall in that landscape but there was no persuading tallness out of heataddled air and that horizonno bloom or gently shaken thing to mark the passage of a breeze only dunes and that distant cliff beneath a sky of burnished silverblue what if there isnt one of the abandoned testing stations across there he wondered what if there are no fremen either and the plants we see are only an accident within the tent jessica awakened turned onto her back and peered sidelong out the transparent end at paul he stood with his back to her and something about his stance reminded her of his father she sensed the well of grief rising within her and turned away presently she adjusted her stillsuit refreshed herself with water from the tents catchpocket and slipped out to stand and stretch the sleep from her muscles paul spoke without turning i find myself enjoying the quiet here how the mind gears itself for its environment she thought and she recalled a bene gesserit axiom the mind can go either direction under stresstoward positive or toward negative on or off think of it as a spectrum whose extremes are unconsciousness at the negative end and hyperconsciousness at the positive end the way the mind will lean under stress is strongly influenced by training it could be a good life here paul said she tried to see the desert through his eyes seeking to encompass all the rigors this planet accepted as commonplace wondering at the possible futures paul had glimpsed one could be alone out here she thought without fear of someone behind you without fear of the hunter she stepped past paul lifted her binoculars adjusted the oil lenses and studied the escarpment across from them yes saguaro in the arroyos and other spiny growth and a matting of low grasses yellowgreen in the shadows ill strike camp paul said jessica nodded walked to the fissures mouth where she could get a sweep of the desert and swung her binoculars to the left a salt pan glared white there with a blending of dirty tan at its edgesa field of white out here where white was death but the pan said another thing water at some time water had flowed across that glaring white she lowered her binoculars adjusted her burnoose listened for a moment to the sound of pauls movements the sun dipped lower shadows stretched across the salt pan lines of wild color spread over the sunset horizon color streamed into a toe of darkness testing the sand coalcolored shadows spread and the thick collapse of night blotted the desert stars she stared up at them sensing pauls movements as he came up beside her the desert night focused upward with a feeling of lift toward the stars the weight of the day receded there came a brief flurry of breeze across her face the first moon will be up soon paul said the packs ready ive planted the thumper we could be lost forever in this hellplace she thought and no one to know the night wind spread sand runnels that grated across her face bringing the smell of cinnamon a shower of odors in the dark smell that paul said i can smell it even through the filter she said riches but will it buy water she pointed across the basin there are no artificial lights across there fremen would be hidden in a sietch behind those rocks he said a sill of silver pushed above the horizon to their right the first moon it lifted into view the hand pattern plain on its face jessica studied the whitesilver of sand exposed in the light i planted the thumper in the deepest part of the crevasse paul said whenever i light its candle itll give us about thirty minutes thirty minutes before it starts calling a worm oh im ready to go he slipped away from her side and she heard his progress back up their fissure the night is a tunnel she thought a hole into tomorrow if we re to have a tomorrow she shook her head why must i be so morbid i was trained better than that paul returned took up the pack led the way down to the first spreading dune where he stopped and listened as his mother came up behind him he heard her soft progress and the cold singlegrain dribbles of soundthe deserts own code spelling out its measure of safety we must walk without rhythm paul said and he called up memory of men walking the sand both prescient memory and real memory watch how i do it he said this is how fremen walk the sand he stepped out onto the windward face of the dune following the curve of it moved with a dragging pace jessica studied his progress for ten steps followed imitating him she saw the sense of it they must sound like the natural shifting of sand like the wind but muscles protested this unnatural broken pattern step drag drag step step wait drag step time stretched out around them the rock face ahead seemed to grow no nearer the one behind still lowered high lump lump lump lump it was a drumming from the cliff behind the thumper paul hissed its pounding continued and they found difficulty avoiding the rhythm of it in their stride lump lump lump lump they moved in a moonlit bowl punctured by that hollowed thumping down and up through spilling dunes step drag wait step across pea sand that rolled under their feet drag wait step and all the while their ears searched for a special hissing the sound when it came started so low that their own dragging passage masked it but it grew louder and louder out of the west lump lump lump lump drummed the thumper the hissing approach spread across the night behind them they turned their heads as they walked saw the mound of the coursing worm keep moving paul whispered dont look back a grating sound of fury exploded from the rock shadows they had left it was a flailing avalanche of noise keep moving paul repeating he saw that they had reached an unmarked point where the two rock facesthe one ahead and the one behindappeared equally remote and still behind them that whipping frenzied tearing of rocks dominated the night they moved on and on and on muscles reached a stage of mechanical aching that seemed to stretch out indefinitely but paul saw that the beckoning escarpment ahead of them had climbed higher jessica moved in a void of concentration aware that the pressure of her will alone kept her walking dryness ached in her mouth but the sounds behind drove away all hope of stopping for a sip from her stillsuits catchpockets lump lump renewed frenzy erupted from the distant cliff drowning out the thumper silence faster paul whispered she nodded knowing he did not see the gesture but needing the action to tell herself that it was necessary to demand even more from muscles that already were being taxed to their limitsthe unnatural movement the rock face of safety ahead of them climbed into the stars and paul saw a plane of flat sand stretching out at the base he stepped onto it stumbled in his fatigue righted himself with an involuntary outthrusting of a foot resonant booming shook the sand around them paul lurched sideways two steps boom boom drum sand jessica hissed paul recovered his balance a sweeping glance took in the sand around them the rock escarpment perhaps two hundred meters away behind them he heard a hissinglike the wind like a riptide where there was no water run jessica screamed paul run they ran drum sound boomed beneath their feet then they were out of it and into pea gravel for a time the running was a relief to muscles that ached from unfamiliar rhythmless use here was action that could be understood here was rhythm but sand and gravel dragged at their feet and the hissing approach of the worm was storm sound that grew around them jessica stumbled to her knees all she could think of was the fatigue and the sound and the terror paul dragged her up they ran on hand in hand a thin pole jutted from the sand ahead of them they passed it saw another jessicas mind failed to register on the poles until they were past there was anotherwindetched surface thrust up from a crack in rock another rock she felt it through her feet the shock of unresisting surface gained new strength from the firmer footing a deep crack stretched its vertical shadow upward into the cliff ahead of them they sprinted for it crowded into the narrow hole behind them the sound of the worms passage stopped jessica and paul turned peered out onto the desert where the dunes began perhaps fifty meters away at the foot of a rock beach a silvergray curve broached from the desert sending rivers of sand and dust cascading all around it lifted higher resolved into a giant questing mouth it was a round black hole with edges glistening in the moonlight the mouth snaked toward the narrow crack where paul and jessica huddled cinnamon yelled in their nostrils moonlight flashed from crystal teeth back and forth the great mouth wove paul stilled his breathing jessica crouched staring it took intense concentration of her bene gesserit training to put down the primal terrors subduing a racememory fear that threatened to fill her mind paul felt a kind of elation in some recent instant he had crossed a time barrier into more unknown territory he could sense the darkness ahead nothing revealed to his inner eye it was as though some step he had taken had plunged him into a well or into the trough of a wave where the future was invisible the landscape had undergone a profound shifting instead of frightening him the sensation of timedarkness forced a hyperacceleration of his other senses he found himself registering every available aspect of the thing that lifted from the sand there seeking him its mouth was some eighty meters in diameter crystal teeth with the curved shape of crysknives glinting around the rim the bellows breath of cinnamon subtle aldehydes acids the worm blotted out the moonlight as it brushed the rocks above them a shower of small stones and sand cascaded into the narrow hiding place paul crowded his mother farther back cinnamon the smell of it flooded across him what has the worm to do with the spice melange he asked himself and he remembered lietkynes betraying a veiled reference to some association between worm and spice barrrroooom it was like a peal of dry thunder coming from far off to their right again barrrroooom the worm drew back onto the sand lay there momentarily its crystal teeth weaving moonflashes lump lump lump lump another thumper paul thought again it sounded off to their right a shudder passed through the worm it drew farther away into the sand only a mounded upper curve remained like half a bell mouth the curve of a tunnel rearing above the dunes sand rasped the creature sank farther retreating turning it became a mound of cresting sand that curved away through a saddle in the dunes paul stepped out of the crack watched the sand wave recede across the waste toward the new thumper summons jessica followed listening lump lump lump lump lump presently the sound stopped paul found the tube into his stillsuit sipped at the reclaimed water jessica focused on his action but her mind felt blank with fatigue and the aftermath of terror has it gone for sure she whispered somebody called it paul said fremen she felt herself recovering it was so big not as big as the one that got our thopter are you sure it was fremen they used a thumper why would they help us maybe they werent helping us maybe they were just calling a worm why an answer lay poised at the edge of his awareness but refused to come he had a vision in his mind of something to do with the telescoping barbed sticks in their packsthe maker hooks why would they call a worm jessica asked a breath of fear touched his mind and he forced himself to turn away from his mother to look up the cliff wed better find a way up there before daylight he pointed those poles we passedthere are more of them she looked following the line of his hand saw the poleswindscratched markersmade out the shadow of a narrow ledge that twisted into a crevasse high above them they mark a way up the cliff paul said he settled his shoulders into the pack crossed to the foot of the ledge and began the climb upward jessica waited a moment resting restoring her strength then she followed up they climbed following the guide poles until the ledge dwindled to a narrow lip at the mouth of a dark crevasse paul tipped his head to peer into the shadowed place he could feel the precarious hold his feet had on the slender ledge but forced himself to slow caution he saw only darkness within the crevasse it stretched away upward open to the stars at the top his ears searched found only sounds he could expecta tiny spill of sand an insect brrr the patter of a small running creature he tested the darkness in the crevasse with one foot found rock beneath a gritting surface slowly he inched around the corner signaled for his mother to follow he grasped a loose edge of her robe helped her around they looked upward at starlight framed by two rock lips paul saw his mother beside him as a cloudy gray movement if we could only risk a light he whispered we have other senses than eyes she said paul slid a foot forward shifted his weight and probed with the other foot met an obstruction he lifted his foot found a step pulled himself up onto it he reached back felt his mothers arm tugged at her robe for her to follow another step it goes on up to the top i think he whispered shallow and even steps jessica thought mancarved beyond a doubt she followed the shadowy movement of pauls progress feeling out the steps rock walls narrowed until her shoulders almost brushed them the steps ended in a slitted defile about twenty meters long its floor level and this opened onto a shallow moonlit basin paul stepped out into the rim of the basin whispered what a beautiful place jessica could only stare in silent agreement from her position a step behind him in spite of weariness the irritation of recaths and nose plugs and the confinement of the stillsuit in spite of fear and the aching desire for rest this basins beauty filled her senses forcing her to stop and admire it like a fairyland paul whispered jessica nodded spreading away in front of her stretched desert growthbushes cacti tiny clumps of leavesall trembling in the moonlight the ringwalls were dark to her left moonfrosted on her right this must be a fremen place paul said there would have to be people for this many plants to survive she agreed she uncapped the tube to her stillsuits catchpockets sipped at it warm faintly acrid wetness slipped down her throat she marked how it refreshed her the tubes cap grated against flakes of sand as she replaced it movement caught pauls attentionto his right and down on the basin floor curving out beneath them he stared down through smoke bushes and weeds into a wedged slab sandsurface of moonlight inhabited by an uphop jump pophop of tiny motion mice he hissed pophophop they went into shadows and out something fell soundlessly past their eyes into the mice there came a thin screech a flapping of wings and a ghostly gray bird lifted away across the basin with a small dark shadow in its talons we needed that reminder jessica thought paul continued to stare across the basin he inhaled sensed the softly cutting contralto smell of sage climbing the night the predatory birdhe thought of it as the way of this desert it had brought a stillness to the basin so unuttered that the bluemilk moonlight could almost be heard flowing across sentinel saguaro and spiked paintbrush there was a low humming of light here more basic in its harmony than any other music in his universe wed better find a place to pitch the tent he said tomorrow we can try to find the fremen who most intruders here regret finding the fremen it was a heavy masculine voice chopping across his words shattering the moment the voice came from above them and to their right please do not run intruders the voice said as paul made to withdraw into the defile if you run youll only waste your bodys water they want us for the water of our flesh jessica thought her muscles overrode all fatigue flowed into maximum readiness without external betrayal she pinpointed the location of the voice thinking such stealth i didnt hear him and she realized that the owner of that voice had permitted himself only the small sounds the natural sounds of the desert another voice called from the basins rim to their left make it quick stil get their water and lets be on our way weve little enough time before dawn paul less conditioned to emergency response than his mother felt chagrin that he had stiffened and tried to withdraw that he had clouded his abilities by a momentary panic he forced himself now to obey her teachings relax than fall into the semblance of relaxation then into the arrested whipsnap of muscles that can slash in any direction still he felt the edge of fear within him and knew its source this was blind time no future he had seen and they were caught between wild fremen whose only interest was the water carried in the flesh of two unshielded bodies this fremen religious adaptation then is the source of what we now recognize as the pillars of the universe whose qizara tafwid are among us all with signs and proofs and prophecy they bring us the arrakeen mystical fusion whose profound beauty is typified by the stirring music built on the old forms but stamped with the new awakening who has not heard and been deeply moved by the old mans hymn i drove my feet through a desert whose mirage fluttered like a host voracious for glory greedy for danger i roamed the horizons of alkulab watching time level mountains in its search and its hunger for me and i saw the sparrows swiftly approach bolder than the onrushing wolf they spread in the tree of my youth i heard the flock in my branches and was caught on their beaks and claws from arrakis awakening by the princess irulan the man crawled across a dunetop he was a mote caught in the glare of the noon sun he was dressed only in torn remnants of a jubba cloak his skin bare to the heat through the tatters the hood had been ripped from the cloak but the man had fashioned a turban from a torn strip of cloth wisps of sandy hair protruded from it matched by a sparse beard and thick brows beneath the bluewithinblue eyes remains of a dark stain spread down to his cheeks a matted depression across mustache and beard showed where a stillsuit tube had marked out its path from nose to catchpockets the man stopped half across the dunecrest arms stretched down the slipface blood had clotted on his back and on his arms and legs patches of yellowgray sand clung to the wounds slowly he brought his hands under him pushed himself to his feet stood there swaying and even in this almostrandom action there remained a trace of onceprecise movement i am lietkynes he said addressing himself to the empty horizon and his voice was a hoarse caricature of the strength it had known i am his imperial majestys planetologist he whispered planetary ecologist for arrakis i am steward of this land he stumbled fell sideways along the crusty surface of the windward face his hands dug feebly into the sand i am steward of this sand he thought he realized that he was semidelirious that he should dig himself into the sand find the relatively cool underlayer and cover himself with it but he could still smell the rank semisweet esters of a prespice pocket somewhere underneath this sand he knew the peril within this fact more certainly than any other fremen if he could smell the prespice mass that meant the gasses deep under the sand were nearing explosive pressure he had to get away from here his hands made weak scrabbling motions along the dune face a thought spread across his mindclear distinct the real wealth of a planet is in its landscape how we take part in that basic source of civilizationagriculture and he thought how strange it was that the mind long fixed on a single track could not get off that track the harkonnen troopers had left him here without water or stillsuit thinking a worm would get him if the desert didnt they had thought it amusing to leave him alive to die by inches at the impersonal hands of his planet the harkonnens always did find it difficult to kill fremen he thought we dont die easily i should be dead now i will be dead soon but i cant stop being an ecologist the highest function of ecology is understanding consequences the voice shocked him because he recognized it and knew the owner of it was dead it was the voice of his father who had been planetologist here before himhis father long dead killed in the cavein at plaster basin got yourself into quite a fix here son his father said you shouldve known the consequences of trying to help the child of that duke im delirious kynes thought the voice seemed to come from his right kynes scraped his face through sand turning to look in that directionnothing except a curving stretch of dune dancing with heat devils in the full glare of the sun the more life there is within a system the more niches there are for life his father said and the voice came now from his left from behind him why does he keep moving around kynes asked himself doesnt he want me to see him life improves the capacity of the environment to sustain life his father said life makes needed nutrients more readily available it binds more energy into the system through the tremendous chemical interplay from organism to organism why does he keep harping on the same subject kynes asked himself i knew that before i was ten desert hawks carrioneaters in this land as were most wild creatures began to circle over him kynes saw a shadow pass near his hand forced his head farther around to look upward the birds were a blurred patch on silverblue skydistant flecks of soot floating above him we are generalists his father said you cant draw neat lines around planetwide problems planetology is a cutandfit science whats he trying to tell me kynes wondered is there some consequence i failed to see his cheek slumped back against the hot sand and he smelled the burned rock odor beneath the prespice gasses from some corner of logic in his mind a thought formed those are carrioneater birds over me perhaps some of my fremen will see them and come to investigate to the working planetologist his most important tool is human beings his father said you must cultivate ecological literacy among the people thats why ive created this entirely new form of ecological notation hes repeating things he said to me when i was a child kynes thought he began to feel cool but that corner of logic in his mind told him the sun is overhead you have no stillsuit and youre hot the sun is burning the moisture out of your body his fingers clawed feebly at the sand they couldnt even leave me a stillsuit the presence of moisture in the air helps prevent toorapid evaporation from living bodies his father said why does he keep repeating the obvious kynes wondered he tried to think of moisture in the airgrass covering this dune open water somewhere beneath him a long qanat flowing with water open to the sky except in text illustrations open water irrigation water it took five thousand cubic meters of water to irrigate one hectare of land per growing season he remembered our first goal on arrakis his father said is grassland provinces we will start with these mutated poverty grasses when we have moisture locked in grasslands well move on to start upland forests then a few open bodies of watersmall at firstand situated along lines of prevailing winds with windtrap moisture precipitators spaced in the lines to recapture what the wind steals we must create a true siroccoa moist windbut we will never get away from the necessity for windtraps always lecturing me kynes thought why doesnt he shut up cant he see im dying you will die too his father said if you dont get off the bubble thats forming right now deep underneath you its there and you know it you can smell the prespice gasses you know the little makers are beginning to lose some of their water into the mass the thought of that water beneath him was maddening he imagined it nowsealed off in strata of porous rock by the leathery halfplant halfanimal little makersand the thin rupture that was pouring a cool stream of clearest pure liquid soothing water into a prespice mass he inhaled smelling the rank sweetness the odor was much richer around him than it had been kynes pushed himself to his knees heard a bird screech the hurried flapping of wings this is spice desert he thought there must be fremen about even in the day sun surely they can see the birds and will investigate movement across the landscape is a necessity for animal life his father said nomad peoples follow the same necessity lines of movement adjust to physical needs for water food minerals we must control this movement now align it for our purposes shut up old man kynes muttered we must do a thing on arrakis never before attempted for an entire planet his father said we must use man as a constructive ecological forceinserting adapted terraform life a plant here an animal there a man in that placeto transform the water cycle to build a new kind of landscape shut up kynes croaked it was lines of movement that gave us the first clue to the relationship between worms and spice his father said a worm kynes thought with a surge of hope a makers sure to come when this bubble bursts but i have no hooks how can i mount a big maker without hooks he could feel frustration sapping what little strength remained to him water so nearonly a hundred meters or so beneath him a worm sure to come but no way to trap it on the surface and use it kynes pitched forward onto the sand returning to the shallow depression his movements had defined he felt sand hot against his left cheek but the sensation was remote the arrakeen environment built itself into the evolutionary pattern of native life forms his father said how strange that so few people ever looked up from the spice long enough to wonder at the nearideal nitrogenoxygenco balance being maintained here in the absence of large areas of plant cover the energy sphere of the planet is there to see and understanda relentless process but a process nonetheless there is a gap in it then something occupies that gap science is made up of so many things that appear obvious after they are explained i knew the little maker was there deep in the sand long before i ever saw it please stop lecturing me father kynes whispered a hawk landed on the sand near his outstretched hand kynes saw it fold its wings tip its head to stare at him he summoned the energy to croak at it the bird hopped away two steps but continued to stare at him men and their works have been a disease on the surface of their planets before now his father said nature tends to compensate for diseases to remove or encapsulate them to incorporate them into the system in her own way the hawk lowered its head stretched its wings refolded them it transferred its attention to his outstretched hand kynes found that he no longer had the strength to croak at it the historical system of mutual pillage and extortion stops here on arrakis his father said you can not go on forever stealing what you need without regard to those who come after the physical qualities of a planet are written into its economic and political record we have the record in front of us and our course is obvious he never could stop lecturing kynes thought lecturing lecturing lecturingalways lecturing the hawk hopped one step closer to kynes outstretched hand turned its head first one way and then the other to study the exposed flesh arrakis is a onecrop planet his father said one crop it supports a ruling class that lives as ruling classes have lived in all times while beneath them a semihuman mass of semislaves exists on the leavings its the masses and the leavings that occupy our attention these are far more valuable than has ever been suspected im ignoring you father kynes whispered go away and he thought surely there must be some of my fremen near they can not help but see the birds over me they will investigate if only to see if theres moisture available the masses of arrakis will know that we work to make the land flow with water his father said most of them of course will have only a semimystical understanding of how we intend to do this many not understanding the prohibitive massratio problem may even think well bring water from some other planet rich in it let them think anything they wish as long as they believe in us in a minute ill get up and tell him what i think of him kynes thought standing there lecturing me when he should be helping me the bird took another hop closer to kynes outstretched hand two more hawks drifted down to the sand behind it religion and law among our masses must be one and the same his father said an act of disobedience must be a sin and require religious penalties this will have the dual benefit of bringing both greater obedience and greater bravery we must depend not so much on the bravery of individuals you see as upon the bravery of a whole population where is my population now when i need it most kynes thought he summoned all his strength moved his hand a fingers width toward the nearest hawk it hopped backward among its companions and all stood poised for flight our timetable will achieve the stature of a natural phenomenon his father said a planets life is a vast tightly interwoven fabric vegetation and animal changes will be determined at first by the raw physical forces we manipulate as they establish themselves though our changes will become controlling influences in their own rightand we will have to deal with them too keep in mind though that we need control only three per cent of the energy surfaceonly three per centto tip the entire structure over into our selfsustaining system why arent you helping we kynes wondered always the same when i need you most you fail me he wanted to turn his head to stare in the direction of his fathers voice stare the old man down muscles refused to answer his demand kynes saw the hawk move it approached his hand a cautious step at a time while its companions waited in mock indifference the hawk stopped only a hop away from his hand a profound clarity filled kynes mind he saw quite suddenly a potential for arrakis that his father had never seen the possibilities along that different path flooded through him no more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the hands of a hero his father said reading my mind kynes thought well let him the messages already have been sent to my sietch villages he thought nothing can stop them if the dukes son is alive theyll find him and protect him as i have commanded they may discard the woman his mother but theyll save the boy the hawk took one hop that brought it within slashing distance of his hand it tipped its head to examine the supine flesh abruptly it straightened stretched its head upward and with a single screech leaped into the air and banked away overhead with its companions behind it theyve come kynes thought my fremen have found me then he heard the sand rumbling every fremen knew the sound could distinguish it immediately from the noises of worms or other desert life somewhere beneath him the prespice mass had accumulated enough water and organic matter from the little makers had reached the critical stage of wild growth a gigantic bubble of carbon dioxide was forming deep in the sand heaving upward in an enormous blow with a dust whirlpool at its center it would exchange what had been formed deep in the sand for whatever lay on the surface the hawks circled overhead screeching their frustration they knew what was happening any desert creature would know and i am a desert creature kynes thought you see me father i am a desert creature he felt the bubble lift him felt it break and the dust whirlpool engulf him dragging him down into cool darkness for a moment the sensation of coolness and the moisture were blessed relief then as his planet killed him it occurred to kynes that his father and all the other scientists were wrong that the most persistent principles of the universe were accident and error even the hawks could appreciate these facts prophecy and presciencehow can they be put to the test in the face of the unanswered questions consider how much is actual prediction of the waveform as muaddib referred to his visionimage and how much is the prophet shaping the future to fit the prophecy what of the harmonics inherent in the act of prophecy does the prophet see the future or does he see a line of weakness a fault or cleavage that he may shatter with words or decisions as a diamondcutter shatters his gem with a blow of a knife private reflections on muaddib by the princess irulan get their water the man calling out of the night had said and paul fought down his fear glanced at his mother his trained eyes saw her readiness for battle the waiting whipsnap of her muscles it would be regrettable should we have to destroy you out of hand the voice above them said thats the one who spoke to us first jessica thought there are at least two of themone to our right and one on our left cignoro hrobosa sukares hin mange la pchagavas doi me kamavas na beslas lele pal hrobas it was the man to their right calling out across the basin to paul the words were gibberish but out of her bene gesserit training jessica recognized the speech it was chakobsa one of the ancient hunting languages and the man above them was saying that perhaps these were the strangers they sought in the sudden silence that followed the calling voice the hoopwheel face of the second moonfaintly ivory bluerolled over the rocks across the basin bright and peering scrambling sounds came from the rocksabove and to both sides dark motions in the moonlight many figures flowed through the shadows a whole troop paul thought with a sudden pang a tall man in a mottled burnoose stepped in front of jessica his mouth baffle was thrown aside for clear speech revealing a heavy beard in the sidelight of the moon but face and eyes were hidden in the overhang of his hood what have we herejinn or human he asked and jessica heard the truebanter in his voice she allowed herself a faint hope this was the voice of command the voice that had first shocked them with its intrusion from the night human i warrant the man said jessica sensed rather than saw the knife hidden in a fold of the mans robe she permitted herself one bitter regret that she and paul had no shields do you also speak the man asked jessica put all the royal arrogance at her command into her manner and voice reply was urgent but she had not heard enough of this man to be certain she had a register on his culture and weaknesses who comes on us like criminals out of the night she demanded the burnoosehooded head showed tension in a sudden twist then slow relaxation that revealed much the man had good control paul shifted away from his mother to separate them as targets and give each of them a clearer arena of action the hooded head turned at pauls movement opening a wedge of face to moonlight jessica saw a sharp nose one glinting eyedark so dark the eye without any white in ita heavy brown and upturned mustache a likely cub the man said if youre fugitives from the harkonnens it may be youre welcome among us what is it boy the possibilities flashed through pauls mind a trick a fact immediate decision was needed why should you welcome fugitives he demanded a child who thinks and speaks like a man the tall man said well now to answer your question my young wali i am one who does not pay the fai the water tribute to the harkonnens that is why i might welcome a fugitive he knows who we are paul thought theres concealment in his voice i am stilgar the fremen the tall man said does that speed your tongue boy it is the same voice paul thought and he remembered the council with this man seeking the body of a friend slain by the harkonnens i know you stilgar paul said i was with my father in council when you came for the water of your friend you took away with you my fathers man duncan idahoan exchange of friends and idaho abandoned us to return to his duke stilgar said jessica heard the shading of disgust in his voice held herself prepared for attack the voice from the rocks above them called we waste time here stil this is the dukes son stilgar barked hes certainly the one liet told us to seek but a child stil the duke was a man and this lad used a thumper stilgar said that was a brave crossing he made in the path of shaihulud and jessica heard him excluding her from his thoughts had he already passed sentence we havent time for the test the voice above them protested yet he could be the lisan algaib stilgar said hes looking for an omen jessica thought but the woman the voice above them said jessica readied herself anew there had been death in that voice yes the woman stilgar said and her water you know the law said the voice from the rocks ones who can not live with the desert be quiet stilgar said times change did liet command this asked the voice from the rocks you heard the voice of the cielago jamis stilgar said why do you press me and jessica thought cielago the clue of the tongue opened wide avenues of understanding this was the language of ilm and fiqh and cielago meant bat a small flying mammal voice of the cielago they had received a distrans message to seek paul and herself i but remind you of your duties friend stilgar said the voice above them my duty is the strength of the tribe stilgar said that is my only duty i need no one to remind me of it this childman interests me he is fullfleshed he has lived on much water he has lived away from the father sun he has not the eyes of the ibad yet he does not speak or act like a weakling of the pans nor did his father how can this be we can not stay out here all night arguing said the voice from the rocks if a patrol i will not tell you again jamis to be quiet stilgar said the man above them remained silent but jessica heard him moving crossing by a leap over a defile and working his way down to the basin floor on their left the voice of the cielago suggested thered be value to us in saving you two stilgar said i can see possibility in this strong boyman he is young and can learn but what of yourself woman he stared at jessica i have his voice and pattern registered now jessica thought i could control him with a word but hes a strong man worth much more to us unblunted and with full freedom of action we shall see i am the mother of this boy jessica said in part his strength which you admire is the product of my training the strength of a woman can be boundless stilgar said certain it is in a reverend mother are you a reverend mother for the moment jessica put aside the implications of the question answered truthfully no are you trained in the ways of the desert no but many consider my training valuable we make our own judgments on value stilgar said every man has the right to his own judgments she said it is well that you see the reason stilgar said we can not dally here to test you woman do you understand wed not want your shade to plague us i will take the boyman your son and he shall have my countenance sanctuary in my tribe but for you womanyou understand there is nothing personal in this it is the rule istislah in the general interest is that not enough paul took a halfstep forward what are you talking about stilgar flicked a glance across paul but kept his attention on jessica unless youve been deeptrained from childhood to live here you could bring destruction onto an entire tribe it is the law and we can not carry useless jessicas motion started as a slumping deceptive faint to the ground it was the obvious thing for a weak outworlder to do and the obvious slows an opponents reactions it takes an instant to interpret a known thing when that thing is exposed as something unknown she shifted as she saw his right shoulder drop to bring a weapon within the folds of his robe to bear on her new position a turn a slash of her arm a whirling of mingled robes and she was against the rocks with the man helpless in front of her at his mothers first movement paul backed two steps as she attacked he dove for shadows a bearded man rose up in his path halfcrouched lunging forward with a weapon in one hand paul took the man beneath the sternum with a straighthand jab sidestepped and chopped the base of his neck relieving him of the weapon as he fell then paul was into the shadows scrambling upward among the rocks the weapon tucked into his waist sash he had recognized it in spite of its unfamiliar shapea projectile weapon and that said many things about this place another clue that shields were not used here they will concentrate on my mother and that stilgar fellow she can handle him i must get to a safe vantage point where i can threaten them and give her time to escape there came a chorus of sharp springclicks from the basin projectiles whined off the rocks around him one of them flicked his robe he squeezed around a corner in the rocks found himself in a narrow vertical crack began inching upwardhis back against one side his feet against the otherslowly as silently as he could the roar of stilgars voice echoed up to him get back you wormheaded lice shell break my neck if you come near a voice out of the basin said the boy got away stil what are we of course he got away you sandbrained ughhh easy woman tell them to stop hunting my son jessica said theyve stopped woman he got away as you intended him to great gods below why didnt you say you were a weirding woman and a fighter tell your men to fall back jessica said tell them to go out into the basin where i can see them and youd better believe that i know how many of them there are and she thought this is the delicate moment but if this man is as sharpminded as i think him we have a chance paul inched his way upward found a narrow ledge on which he could rest and look down into the basin stilgars voice came up to him and if i refuse how can you ughhh leave be woman we mean no harm to you now great gods if you can do this to the strongest of us youre worth ten times your weight of water now the test of reason jessica thought she said you ask after the lisan algaib you could be the folk of the legend he said but ill believe that when its been tested all i know now is that you came here with that stupid duke who aieeee woman i care not if you kill me he was honorable and brave but it was stupid to put himself in the way of the harkonnen fist silence presently jessica said he had no choice but well not argue it now tell that man of yours behind the bush over there to stop trying to bring his weapon to bear on me or ill rid the universe of you and take him next you there stilgar roared do as she says but stil do as she says you wormfaced crawling sandbrained piece of lizard turd do it or ill help her dismember you cant you see the worth of this woman the man at the bush straightened from his partial concealment lowered his weapon he has obeyed stilgar said now jessica said explain clearly to your people what it is you wish of me i want no young hothead to make a foolish mistake when we slip into the villages and towns we must mask our origin blend with the pan and graben folk stilgar said we carry no weapons for the crysknife is sacred but you woman you have the weirding ability of battle wed only heard of it and many doubted but one can not doubt what he sees with his own eyes you mastered an armed fremen this is a weapon no search could expose there was a stirring in the basin as stilgars words sank home and if i agree to teach you the weirding way my countenance for you as well as your son how can we be sure of the truth in your promise stilgars voice lost some of its subtle undertone of reasoning took on an edge of bitterness out here woman we carry no paper for contracts we make no evening promises to be broken at dawn when a man says a thing thats the contract as leader of my people ive put them in bond to my word teach us this weirding way and you have sanctuary with us as long as you wish your water shall mingle with our water can you speak for all fremen jessica asked in time that may be but only my brother liet speaks for all fremen here i promise only secrecy my people will not speak of you to any other sietch the harkonnens have returned to dune in force and your duke is dead it is said that you two died in a mother storm the hunter does not seek dead game theres safety in that jessica thought but these people have good communications and a message could be sent i presume there was a reward offered for us she said stilgar remained silent and she could almost see the thoughts turning over in his head sensing the shifts of his muscles beneath her hands presently he said i will say it once more ive given the tribes wordbond my people know your worth to us now what could the harkonnens give us our freedom hah no you are the taqwa that which buys us more than all the spice in the harkonnen coffers then i shall teach you my way of battle jessica said and she sensed the unconscious ritualintensity of her own words now will you release me so be it jessica said she released her hold on him stepped aside in full view of the bank in the basin this is the testmashed she thought but paul must know about them even if i die for his knowledge in the waiting silence paul inched forward to get a better view of where his mother stood as he moved he heard heavy breathing suddenly stilled above him in the vertical crack of the rock and sensed a faint shadow there outlined against the stars stilgars voice came up from the basin you up there stop hunting the boy hell come down presently the voice of a young boy or a girl sounded from the darkness above paul but stil he cant be far from i said leave him be chani you spawn of a lizard there came a whispered imprecation from above paul and a low voice call me spawn of a lizard but the shadow pulled back out of view paul returned his attention to the basin picking out the grayshadowed movement of stilgar beside his mother come in all of you stilgar called he turned to jessica and now ill ask you how we may be certain youll fulfill your half of our bargain youre the ones lived with papers and empty contracts and such as we of the bene gesserit dont break our vows any more than you do jessica said there was a protracted silence then a multiple hissing of voices a bene gesserit witch paul brought his captured weapon from his sash trained it on the dark figure of stilgar but the man and his companions remained immobile staring at jessica it is the legend someone said it was said that the shadout mapes gave this report on you stilgar said but a thing so important must be tested if you are the bene gesserit of the legend whose son will lead us to paradise he shrugged jessica sighed thinking so our missionaria protectiva even planted religious safety valves all through this hell hole ah well itll help and thats what it was meant to do she said the seeress who brought you the legend she gave it under the binding of karama and ijaz the miracle and the inimitability of the prophecythis i know do you wish a sign his nostrils flared in the moonlight we can not tarry for the rites he whispered jessica recalled a chart kynes had shown her while arranging emergency escape routes how long ago it seemed there had been a place called sietch tabr on the chart and beside it the notation stilgar perhaps when we get to sietch tabr she said the revelation shook him and jessica thought if only he knew the tricks we use she mustve been good that bene gesserit of the missionaria protectiva these fremen are beautifully prepared to believe in us stilgar shifted uneasily we must go now she nodded letting him know that they left with her permission he looked up at the cliff almost directly at the rock ledge where paul crouched you there lad you may come down now he returned his attention to jessica spoke with an apologetic tone your son made an incredible amount of noise climbing he has much to learn lest he endanger us all but hes young no doubt we have much to teach each other jessica said meanwhile youd best see to your companion out there my noisy son was a bit rough in disarming him stilgar whirled his hood flapping where beyond those bushes she pointed stilgar touched two of his men see to it he glanced at his companions identifying them jamis is missing he turned to jessica even your cub knows the weirding way and youll notice that my son hasnt stirred from up there as you ordered jessica said the two men stilgar had sent returned supporting a third who stumbled and gasped between them stilgar gave them a flicking glance returned his attention to jessica the son will take only your orders eh good he knows discipline paul you may come down now jessica said paul stood up emerging into moonlight above his concealing cleft slipped the fremen weapon back into his sash as he turned another figure arose from the rocks to face him in the moonlight and reflection off gray stone paul saw a small figure in fremen robes a shadowed face peering out at him from the hood and the muzzle of one of the projectile weapons aimed at him from a fold of robe i am chani daughter of liet the voice was lilting half filled with laughter i would not have permitted you to harm my companions she said paul swallowed the figure in front of him turned into the moons path and he saw an elfin face black pits of eyes the familiarity of that face the features out of numberless visions in his earliest prescience shocked paul to stillness he remembered the angry bravado with which he had once described this facefromadream telling the reverend mother gains helen mohiam i will meet her and here was the face but in no meeting he had ever dreamed you were as noisy as shaihulud in a rage she said and you took the most difficult way up here follow me ill show you an easier way down he scrambled out of the cleft followed the swirling of her robe across a tumbled landscape she moved like a gazelle dancing over the rocks paul felt hot blood in his face was thankful for the darkness that girl she was like a touch of destiny he felt caught up on a wave in tune with a motion that lifted all his spirits they stood presently amidst the fremen on the basin floor jessica turned a wry smile on paul but spoke to stilgar this will be a good exchange of teachings i hope you and your people feel no anger at our violence it seemed necessary you were about to make a mistake to save one from a mistake is a gift of paradise stilgar said he touched his lips with his left hand lifted the weapon from pauls waist with the other tossed it to a companion you will have your own maula pistol lad when youve earned it paul started to speak hesitated remembering his mothers teaching beginnings are such delicate times my son has what weapons he needs jessica said she stared at stilgar forcing him to think of how paul had acquired the pistol stilgar glanced at the man paul had subduedjamis the man stood at one side head lowered breathing heavily you are a difficult woman stilgar said he held out his left hand to a companion snapped his fingers kushti bakka te more chakobsa jessica thought the companion pressed two squares of gauze into stilgars hand stilgar ran them through his fingers fixed one around jessicas neck beneath her hood fitted the other around pauls neck in the same way now you wear the kerchief of the bakka he said if we become separated you will be recognized as belonging to stilgars sietch we will talk of weapons another time he moved out through his band now inspecting them giving pauls fremkit pack to one of his men to carry bakka jessica thought recognizing the religious term bakkathe weeper she sensed how the symbolism of the kerchiefs united this band why should weeping unite them she asked herself stilgar came to the young girl who had embarrassed paul said chani take the childman under your wing keep him out of trouble chani touched pauls arm come along childman paul hid the anger in his voice said my name is paul it were well you well give you a name manling stilgar said in the time of the mihna at the test of aql the test of reason jessica translated the sudden need of pauls ascendancy overrode all other consideration and she barked my sons been tested with the gom jabbar in the stillness that followed she knew she had struck to the heart of them theres much we dont know of each other stilgar said but we tarry overlong daysun mustnt find us in the open he crossed to the man paul had struck down said jamis can you travel a grunt answered him surprised me he did twas an accident i can travel no accident stilgar said ill hold you responsible with chani for the lads safety jamis these people have my countenance jessica stared at the man jamis his was the voice that had argued with stilgar from the rocks his was the voice with death in it and stilgar had seen fit to reinforce his order with this jamis stilgar flicked a testing glance across the group motioned two men out larus and farrukh you are to hide our tracks see that we leave no trace extra carewe have two with us whove not been trained he turned hand upheld and aimed across the basin in squad line with flankersmove out we must be at cave of the ridges before dawn jessica fell into step beside stilgar counting heads there were forty fremenshe and paul made it fortytwo and she thought they travel as a military companyeven the girl chani paul took a place in the line behind chani he had put down the black feeling at being caught by the girl in his mind now was the memory called up by his mothers barked reminder my sons been tested with the gom jabbar he found that his hand tingled with remembered pain watch where you go chani hissed do not brush against a bush lest you leave a thread to show our passage paul swallowed nodded jessica listened to the sounds of the troop hearing her own footsteps and pauls marveling at the way the fremen moved they were forty people crossing the basin with only the sounds natural to the placeghostly feluccas their robes flitting through the shadows their destination was sietch tabrstilgars sietch she turned the word over in her mind sietch it was a chakobsa word unchanged from the old hunting language out of countless centuries sietch a meeting place in time of danger the profound implications of the word and the language were just beginning to register with her after the tension of their encounter we move well stilgar said with shaihuluds favor well reach cave of the ridges before dawn jessica nodded conserving her strength sensing the terrible fatigue she held at bay by force of will and she admitted it by the force of elation her mind focused on the value of this troop seeing what was revealed here about the fremen culture all of them she thought an entire culture trained to military order what a priceless thing is here for an outcast duke the fremen were supreme in that quality the ancients called spannungsbogenwhich is the selfimposed delay between desire for a thing and the act of reaching out to grasp that thing from the wisdom of muaddib by the princess irulan they approached cave of the ridges at dawnbreak moving through a split in the basin wall so narrow they had to turn sideways to negotiate it jessica saw stilgar detach guards in the thin dawnlight saw them for a moment as they began their scrambling climb up the cliff paul turned his head upward as he walked seeing the tapestry of this planet cut in cross section where the narrow cleft gaped toward grayblue sky chani pulled at his robe to hurry him said quickly it is already light the men who climbed above us where are they going paul whispered the first daywatch she said hurry now a guard left outside paul thought wise but it wouldve been wiser still for us to approach this place in separate bands less chance of losing the whole troop he paused in the thought realizing that this was guerrilla thinking and he remembered his fathers fear that the atreides might become a guerrilla house faster chani whispered paul sped his steps hearing the swish of robes behind and he thought of the words of the sirat from yuehs tiny c bible paradise on my right hell on my left and the angel of death behind he rolled the quotation in his mind they rounded a corner where the passage widened stilgar stood at one side motioning them into a low hole that opened at right angles quickly he hissed were like rabbits in a cage if a patrol catches us here paul bent for the opening followed chani into a cave illuminated by thin gray light from somewhere ahead you can stand up she said he straightened studied the place a deep and wide area with domed ceiling that curved away just out of a mans handreach the troop spread out through shadows paul saw his mother come up on one side saw her examine their companions and he noted how she failed to blend with the fremen even though her garb was identical the way she movedsuch a sense of power and grace find a place to rest and stay out of the way childman chani said heres food she pressed two leafwrapped morsels into his hand they reeked of spice stilgar came up behind jessica called an order to a group on the left get the doorseal in place and see to moisture security he turned to another fremen lemil get glowglobes he took jessicas arm i wish to show you something weirding woman he led her around a curve of rock toward the light source jessica found herself looking out across the wide lip of another opening to the cave an opening high in a cliff walllooking out across another basin about ten or twelve kilometers wide the basin was shielded by high rock walls sparse clumps of plant growth were scattered around it as she looked at the dawngray basin the sun lifted over the far escarpment illuminating a biscuitcolored landscape of rocks and sand and she noted how the sun of arrakis appeared to leap over the horizon its because we want to hold it back she thought night is safer than day there came over her then a longing for a rainbow in this place that would never see rain i must suppress such longings she thought theyre a weakness i no longer can afford weaknesses stilgar gripped her arm pointed across the basin there there you see proper druses she looked where he pointed saw movement people on the basin floor scattering at the daylight into the shadows of the opposite cliffwall in spite of the distance their movements were plain in the clear air she lifted her binoculars from beneath her robe focused the oil lenses on the distant people kerchiefs fluttered like a flight of multicolored butterflies that is home stilgar said we will be there this night he stared across the basin tugging at his mustache my people stayed out overlate working that means there are no patrols about ill signal them later and theyll prepare for us your people show good discipline jessica said she lowered the binoculars saw that stilgar was looking at them they obey the preservation of the tribe he said it is the way we choose among us for a leader the leader is the one who is strongest the one who brings water and security he lifted his attention to her face she returned his stare noted the whiteless eyes the stained eyepits the dustrimmed beard and mustache the line of the catchtube curving down from his nostrils into his stillsuit have i compromised your leadership by besting you stilgar she asked you did not call me out he said its important that a leader keep the respect of his troop she said isnt a one of those sandlice i can not handle stilgar said when you bested me you bested us all now they hope to learn from you the weirding way and some are curious to see if you intend to call me out she weighed the implications by besting you in formal battle he nodded id advise you against this because theyd not follow you youre not of the sand they saw this in our nights passage practical people she said true enough he glanced at the basin we know our needs but not many are thinking deep thoughts now this close to home weve been out overlong arranging to deliver our spice quota to the free traders for the cursed guild may their faces be forever black jessica stopped in the act of turning away from him looked back up into his face the guild what has the guild to do with your spice its liets command stilgar said we know the reason but the taste of it sours us we bribe the guild with a monstrous payment in spice to keep our skies clear of satellites and such that none may spy what we do to the face of arrakis she weighed out her words remembering that paul had said this must be the reason arrakeen skies were clear of satellites and what is it you do to the face of arrakis that must not be seen we change it slowly but with certainty to make it fit for human life our generation will not see it nor our children nor our childrens children nor the grandchildren of their children but it will come he stared with veiled eyes out over the basin open water and tall green plants and people walking freely without stillsuits so thats the dream of this lietkynes she thought and she said bribes are dangerous they have a way of growing larger and larger they grow he said but the slow way is the safe way jessica turned looked out over the basin trying to see it the way stilgar was seeing it in his imagination she saw only the grayed mustard stain of distant rocks and a sudden hazy motion in the sky above the cliffs ahhhh stilgar said she thought at first it must be a patrol vehicle then realized it was a mirageanother landscape hovering over the desertsand and a distant wavering of greenery and in the middle distance a long worm traveling the surface with what looked like fremen robes fluttering on its back the mirage faded it would be better to ride stilgar said but we can not permit a maker into this basin thus we must walk again tonight makertheir word for worm she thought she measured the import of his words the statement that they could not permit a worm into this basin she knew what she had seen in the miragefremen riding on the back of a giant worm it took heavy control not to betray her shock at the implications we must be getting back to the others stilgar said else my people may suspect i dally with you some already are jealous that my hands tasted your loveliness when we struggled last night in tuono basin that will be enough of that jessica snapped no offense stilgar said and his voice was mild women among us are not taken against their will and with you he shrugged even that convention isnt required you will keep in mind that i was a dukes lady she said but her voice was calmer as you wish he said its time to seal off this opening to permit relaxation of stillsuit discipline my people need to rest in comfort this day their families will give them little rest on the morrow silence fell between them jessica stared out into the sunlight she had heard what she had heard in stilgars voicethe unspoken offer of more than his countenance did he need a wife she realized she could step into that place with him it would be one way to end conflict over tribal leadershipfemale properly aligned with male but what of paul then who could tell yet what rules of parenthood prevailed here and what of the unborn daughter she had carried these few weeks what of a dead dukes daughter and she permitted herself to face fully the significance of this other child growing within her to see her own motives in permitting the conception she knew what it wasshe had succumbed to that profound drive shared by all creatures who are faced with deaththe drive to seek immortality through progeny the fertility drive of the species had overpowered them jessica glanced at stilgar saw that he was studying her waiting a daughter born here to a woman wed to such a one as this manwhat would be the fate of such a daughter she asked herself would he try to limit the necessities that a bene gesserit must follow stilgar cleared his throat and revealed then that he understood some of the questions in her mind what is important for a leader is that which makes him a leader it is the needs of his people if you teach me your powers there may come a day when one of us must challenge the other i would prefer some alternative there are several alternatives she asked the sayyadina he said our reverend mother is old their reverend mother before she could probe this he said i do not necessarily offer myself as mate this is nothing personal for you are beautiful and desirable but should you become one of my women that might lead some of my young men to believe that im too much concerned with pleasures of the flesh and not enough concerned with the tribes needs even now they listen to us and watch us a man who weighs his decisions who thinks of consequences she thought there are those among my young men who have reached the age of wild spirits he said they must be eased through this period i must leave no great reasons around for them to challenge me because i would have to maim and kill among them this is not the proper course for a leader if it can be avoided with honor a leader you see is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a people he maintains the level of individuals too few individuals and a people reverts to a mob his words the depth of their awareness the fact that he spoke as much to her as to those who secretly listened forced her to reevaluate him he has stature she thought where did he learn such inner balance the law that demands our form of choosing a leader is a just law stilgar said but it does not follow that justice is always the thing a people needs what we truly need now is time to grow and prosper to spread our force over more land what is his ancestry she wondered whence comes such breeding she said stilgar i underestimated you such was my suspicion he said each of us apparently underestimated the other she said i should like an end to this he said i should like friendship with you and trust i should like that respect for each other which grows in the breast without demand for the huddlings of sex i understand she said do you trust me i hear your sincerity among us he said the sayyadina when they are not the formal leaders hold a special place of honor they teach they maintain the strength of god here he touched his breast now i must probe this reverend mother mystery she thought and she said you spoke of your reverend mother and ive heard words of legend and prophecy it is said that a bene gesserit and her offspring hold the key to our future he said do you believe i am that one she watched his face thinking the young reed dies so easily beginnings are times of such great peril we do not know he said she nodded thinking hes an honorable man he wants a sign from me but hell not tip fate by telling me the sign jessica turned her head stared down into the basin at the golden shadows the purple shadows the vibrations of dustmote air across the lip of their cave her mind was filled suddenly with feline prudence she knew the cant of the missionaria protectiva knew how to adapt the techniques of legend and fear and hope to her emergency needs but she sensed wild changes here as though someone had been in among these fremen and capitalized on the missionaria protectivas imprint stilgar cleared his throat she sensed his impatience knew that the day moved ahead and men waited to seal off this opening this was a time for boldness on her part and she realized what she needed some dar alhikman some school of translation that would give her adab she whispered her mind felt as though it had rolled over within her she recognized the sensation with a quickening of pulse nothing in all the bene gesserit training carried such a signal of recognition it could be only the adab the demanding memory that comes upon you of itself she gave herself up to it allowing the words to flow from her ibn qirtaiba she said as far as the spot where the dust ends she stretched out an arm from her robe seeing stilgars eyes go wide she heard a rustling of many robes in the background i see a fremen with the book of examples she intoned he reads to allat the sun whom he defied and subjugated he reads to the sadus of the trial and this is what he reads mine enemies are like green blades eaten down that did stand in the path of the tempest hast thou not seen what our lord did he sent the pestilence among them that did lay schemes against us they are like birds scattered by the huntsman their schemes are like pellets of poison that every mouth rejects a trembling passed through her she dropped her arm back to her from the inner caves shadows came a whispered response of many voices their works have been overturned the fire of god mount over thy heart she said and she thought now it goes in the proper channel the fire of god set alight came the response she nodded thine enemies shall fall she said bila kaifa they answered in the sudden hush stilgar bowed to her sayyadina he said if the shaihulud grant then you may yet pass within to become a reverend mother pass within she thought an odd way of putting it but the rest of it fitted into the cant well enough and she felt a cynical bitterness at what she had done our missionaria protectiva seldom fails a place was prepared for us in this wilderness the prayer of the salat has carved out our hiding place now i must play the part of auliya the friend of god sayyadina to rogue peoples whove been so heavily imprinted with our bene gesserit soothsay they even call their chief priestesses reverend mothers paul stood beside chani in the shadows of the inner cave he could still taste the morsel she had fed himbird flesh and grain bound with spice honey and encased in a leaf in tasting it he had realized he never before had eaten such a concentration of spice essence and there had been a moment of fear he knew what this essence could do to himthe spice change that pushed his mind into prescient awareness bila kaifa chani whispered he looked at her seeing the awe with which the fremen appeared to accept his mothers words only the man called jamis seemed to stand aloof from the ceremony holding himself apart with arms folded across his breast duy yakha bin mange chani whispered duy punra bin mange i have two eyes i have two feet and she stared at paul with a look of wonder paul took a deep breath trying to still the tempest within him his mothers words had locked onto the working of the spice essence and he had felt her voice rise and fall within him like the shadows of an open fire through it all he had sensed the edge of cynicism in herhe knew her so wellbut nothing could stop this thing that had begun with a morsel of food terrible purpose he sensed it the race consciousness that he could not escape there was the sharpened clarity the inflow of data the cold precision of his awareness he sank to the floor sitting with his back against rock giving himself up to it awareness flowed into that timeless stratum where he could view time sensing the available paths the winds of the future the winds of the past the oneeyed vision of the past the oneeyed vision of the present and the oneeyed vision of the futureall combined in a trinocular vision that permitted him to see timebecomespace there was danger he felt of overrunning himself and he had to hold onto his awareness of the present sensing the blurred deflection of experience the flowing moment the continual solidification of thatwhichis into the perpetualwas in grasping the present he felt for the first time the massive steadiness of times movement everywhere complicated by shifting currents waves surges and countersurges like surf against rocky cliffs it gave him a new understanding of his prescience and he saw the source of blind time the source of error in it with an immediate sensation of fear the prescience he realized was an illumination that incorporated the limits of what it revealedat once a source of accuracy and meaningful error a kind of heisenberg indeterminacy intervened the expenditure of energy that revealed what he saw changed what he saw and what he saw was a time nexus within this cave a boiling of possibilities focused here wherein the most minute actionthe wink of an eye a careless word a misplaced grain of sandmoved a gigantic lever across the known universe he saw violence with the outcome subject to so many variables that his slightest movement created vast shiftings in the pattern the vision made him want to freeze into immobility but this too was action with its consequences the countless consequenceslines fanned out from this cave and along most of these consequencelines he saw his own dead body with blood flowing from a gaping knife wound my father the padishah emperor was yet looked no more than the year he encompassed the death of duke leto and gave arrakis back to the harkonnens he seldom appeared in public wearing other than a sardaukar uniform and a bursegs black helmet with the imperial lion in gold upon its crest the uniform was an open reminder of where his power lay he was not always that blatant though when he wanted he could radiate charm and sincerity but i often wonder in these later days if anything about him was as it seemed i think now he was a man fighting constantly to escape the bars of an invisible cage you must remember that he was an emperor fatherhead of a dynasty that reached back into the dimmest history but we denied him a legal son was this not the most terrible defeat a ruler ever suffered my mother obeyed her sister superiors where the lady jessica disobeyed which of them was the stronger history already has answered in my fathers house by the princess irulan jessica awakened in cave darkness sensing the stir of fremen around her smelling the acrid stillsuit odor her inner timesense told her it would soon be night outside but the cave remained in blackness shielded from the desert by the plastic hoods that trapped their body moisture within this space she realized that she had permitted herself the utterly relaxing sleep of great fatigue and this suggested something of her own unconscious assessment on personal security within stilgars troop she turned in the hammock that had been fashioned of her robe slipped her feet to the rock floor and into her desert boots i must remember to fasten the boots slipfashion to help my stillsuits pumping action she thought there are so many things to remember she could still taste their morning mealthe morsel of bird flesh and grain bound within a leaf with spice honeyand it came to her that the use of time was turned around here night was the day of activity and day was the time of rest night conceals night is safest she unhooked her robe from its hammock pegs in a rock alcove fumbled with the fabric in the dark until she found the top slipped into it how to get a message out to the bene gesserit she wondered they would have to be told of the two strays in arrakeen sanctuary glowglobes came alight farther into the cave she saw people moving there paul among them already dressed and with his hood thrown back to reveal the aquiline atreides profile he had acted so strangely before they retired she thought withdrawn he was like one come back from the dead not yet fully aware of his return his eyes half shut and glassy with the inward stare it made her think of his warning about the spiceimpregnated diet addictive are there side effects she wondered he said it had something to do with his prescient faculty but he has been strangely silent about what he sees stilgar came from shadows to her right crossed to the group beneath the glowglobes she marked how he fingered his beard and the watchful catstalking look of him abrupt fear shot through jessica as her senses awakened to the tensions visible in the people gathered around paulthe stiff movements the ritual positions they have my countenance stilgar rumbled jessica recognized the man stilgar confrontedjamis she saw then the rage in jamisthe tight set of his shoulders jamis the man paul bested she thought you know the rule stilgar jamis said who knows it better stilgar asked and she heard the tone of placation in his voice the attempt to smooth something over i choose the combat jamis growled jessica sped across the cave grasped stilgars arm what is this she asked it is the amtal rule stilgar said jamis is demanding the right to test your part in the legend she must be championed jamis said if her champion wins thats the truth in it but its said he glanced across the press of people that shed need no champion from the fremenwhich can mean only that she brings her own champion hes talking of single combat with paul jessica thought she released stilgars arm took a halfstep forward im always my own champion she said the meanings simple enough for youll not tell us our ways jamis snapped not without more proof than ive seen stilgar couldve told you what to say last morning he couldve filled your mind full of the coddle and you couldve birdtalked it to us hoping to make a false way among us i can take him jessica thought but that might conflict with the way they interpret the legend and again she wondered at the way the missionaria protectivas work had been twisted on this planet stilgar looked at jessica spoke in a low voice but one designed to carry to the crowds fringe jamis is one to hold a grudge sayyadina your son bested him and it was an accident jamis roared there was witchforce at tuono basin and ill prove it now and ive bested him myself stilgar continued he seeks by this tahaddi challenge to get back at me as well theres too much of violence in jamis for him ever to make a good leadertoo much ghafla the distraction he gives his mouth to the rules and his heart to the sarfa the turning away no he could never make a good leader ive preserved him this long because hes useful in a fight as such but when he gets this carving anger on him hes dangerous to his own society stilgarrrr jamis rumbled and jessica saw what stilgar was doing trying to enrage jamis to take the challenge away from paul stilgar faced jamis and again jessica heard the soothing in the rumbling voice jamis hes but a boy hes you named him a man jamis said his mother says hes been through the gom jabbar hes fullfleshed and with a surfeit of water the ones who carried their pack say theres literjons of water in it literjons and us sipping our catchpockets the instant they show dewsparkle stilgar glanced at jessica is this true is there water in your pack yes literjons of it two literjons what was intended with this wealth wealth she thought she shook her head feeling the coldness in his voice where i was born water fell from the sky and ran over the land in wide rivers she said there were oceans of it so broad you could not see the other shore ive not been trained to your water discipline i never before had to think of it this way a sighing gasp arose from the people around them water fell from the sky it ran over the land did you know therere those among us whove lost from their catchpockets by accident and will be in sore trouble before we reach tabr this night how could i know jessica shook her head if theyre in need give them water from our pack is that what you intended with this wealth i intended it to save life she said then we accept your blessing sayyadina youll not buy us off with water jamis growled nor will you anger me against yourself stilgar i see you trying to make me call you out before ive proved my words stilgar faced jamis are you determined to press this fight against a child jamis his voice was low venomous she must be championed even though she has my countenance i invoke the amtal rule jamis said its my right stilgar nodded then if the boy does not carve you down youll answer to my knife afterward and this time ill not hold back the blade as ive done before you can not do this thing jessica said pauls just you must not interfere sayyadina stilgar said oh i know you can take me and therefore can take anyone among us but you can not best us all united this must be it is the amtal rule jessica fell silent staring at him in the green light of the glowglobes seeing the demoniacal stiffness that had taken over his expression she shifted her attention to jamis saw the brooding look to his brows and thought i shouldve seen that before he broods hes the silent kind one who works himself up inside i shouldve been prepared if you harm my son she said youll have me to meet i call you out now ill carve you into a joint of mother paul stepped forward touched her sleeve perhaps if i explain to jamis how explain jamis sneered paul fell silent staring at the man he felt no fear of him jamis appeared clumsy in his movements and he had fallen so easily in their night encounter on the sand but paul still felt the nexusboiling of this cave still remembered the prescient visions of himself dead under a knife there had been so few avenues of escape for him in that vision stilgar said sayyadina you must step back now where stop calling her sayyadina jamis said thats yet to be proved so she knows the prayer whats that every child among us knows it he has talked enough jessica thought ive the key to him i could immobilize him with a word she hesitated but i can not stop them all you will answer to me then jessica said and she pitched her voice in a twisting tone with a little whine in it and a catch at the end jamis stared at her fright visible on his face ill teach you agony she said in the same tone remember that as you fight youll have agony such as will make the gom jabbar a happy memory by comparison you will writhe with your entire she tries a spell on me jamis gasped he put his clenched right fist beside his ear i invoke the silence on her so be it then stilgar said he cast a warning glance at jessica if you speak again sayyadina well know its your witchcraft and youll be forfeit he nodded for her to step back jessica felt hands pulling her helping her back and she sensed they were not unkindly she saw paul being separated from the throng the elfinfaced chani whispering in his ear as she nodded toward jamis a ring formed within the troop more glowglobes were brought and all of them tuned to the yellow band jamis stepped into the ring slipped out of his robe and tossed it to someone in the crowd he stood there in a cloudy gray slickness of stillsuit that was patched and marked by tucks and gathers for a moment he bent with his mouth to his shoulder drinking from a catchpocket tube presently he straightened peeled off and detached the suit handed it carefully into the crowd he stood waiting clad in loincloth and some tight fabric over his feet a crysknife in his right hand jessica saw the girlchild chani helping paul saw her press a crysknife handle into his palm saw him heft it testing the weight and balance and it came to jessica that paul had been trained in prana and bindu the nerve and the fiberthat he had been taught fighting in a deadly school his teachers men like duncan idaho and gurney halleck men who were legends in their own lifetimes the boy knew the devious ways of the bene gesserit and he looked supple and confident but hes only fifteen she thought and he has no shield i must stop this somehow there must be a way to she looked up saw stilgar watching her you can not stop it he said you must not speak she put a hand over her mouth thinking ive planted fear in jamis mind itll slow him some perhaps if i could only praytruly pray paul stood alone now just into the ring clad in the fighting trunks hed worn under his stillsuit he held a crysknife in his right hand his feet were bare against the sandgritted rock idaho had warned him time and again when in doubt of your surface bare feet are best and there were chanis words of instruction still in the front of his consciousness jamis turns to the right with his knife after a parry its a habit in him weve all seen and hell aim for the eyes to catch a blink in which to slash you and he can fight either hand took out for a knife shift but strongest in paul so that he felt it with his entire body was training and the instinctual reaction mechanism that had been hammered into him day after day hour after hour on the practice floor gurney hallecks words were there to remember the good knife fighter thinks on point and blade and shearingguard simultaneously the point can also cut the blade can also stab the shearingguard can also trap your opponents blade paul glanced at the crysknife there was no shearingguard only the slim round ring of the handle with its raised lips to protect the hand and even so he realized that he did not know the breaking tension of this blade did not even know if it could be broken jamis began sidling to the right along the edge of the ring opposite paul paul crouched realizing then that he had no shield but was trained to fighting with its subtle field around him trained to react on defense with utmost speed while his attack would be timed to the controlled slowness necessary for penetrating the enemys shield in spite of constant warning from his trainers not to depend on the shields mindless blunting of attack speed he knew that shieldawareness was part of him jamis called out in ritual challenge may thy knife chip and shatter this knife will break then paul thought he cautioned himself that jamis also was without shield but the man wasnt trained to its use had no shieldfighter inhibitions paul stared across the ring at jamis the mans body looked like knotted whipcord on a dried skeleton his crysknife shone milky yellow in the light of the glowglobes fear coursed through paul he felt suddenly alone and naked standing in dull yellow light within this ring of people prescience had fed his knowledge with countless experiences hinted at the strongest currents of the future and the strings of decision that guided them but this was the realnow this was death hanging on an infinite number of miniscule mischances anything could tip the future here he realized someone coughing in the troop of watchers a distraction a variation in a glowglobes brilliance a deceptive shadow im afraid paul told himself and he circled warily opposite jamis repeating silently to himself the bene gesserit litany against fear fear is the mindkiller it was a cool bath washing over him he felt muscles untie themselves become poised and ready ill sheath my knife in your blood jamis snarled and in the middle of the last word he pounced jessica saw the motion stifled an outcry where the man struck there was only empty air and paul stood now behind jamis with a clear shot at the exposed back now paul now jessica screamed it in her mind pauls motion was slowly timed beautifully fluid but so slow it gave jamis the margin to twist away backing and turning to the right paul withdrew crouching low first you must find my blood he said jessica recognized the shieldfighter timing in her son and it came over her what a twoedged thing that was the boys reactions were those of youth and trained to a peak these people had never seen but the attack was trained too and conditioned by the necessities of penetrating a shield barrier a shield would repel too fast a blow admit only the slowly deceptive counter it needed control and trickery to get through a shield does paul see it she asked herself he must again jamis attacked inkdark eyes glaring his body a yellow blur under the glowglobes and again paul slipped away to return too slowly on the attack and again and again each time pauls counterblow came an instant late and jessica saw a thing she hoped jamis did not see pauls defensive reactions were blindingly fast but they moved each time at the precisely correct angle they would take if a shield were helping deflect part of jamis blow is your son playing with that poor fool stilgar asked he waved her to silence before she could respond sorry you must remain silent now the two figures on the rock floor circled each other jamis with knife hand held far forward and tipped up slightly paul crouched with knife held low again jamis pounced and this time he twisted to the right where paul had been dodging instead of faking back and out paul met the mans knife hand on the point of his own blade then the boy was gone twisting away to the left and thankful for chanis warning jamis backed into the center of the circle rubbing his knife hand blood dripped from the injury for a moment stopped his eyes were wide and staringtwo blueblack holesstudying paul with a new wariness in the dull light of the glowglobes ah that one hurt stilgar murmured paul crouched at the ready and as he had been trained to do after first blood called out do you yield hah jamis cried an angry murmur arose from the troop hold stilgar called out the lad doesnt know our rule then to paul there can be no yielding in the tahaddichallenge death is the test of it jessica saw paul swallow hard and she thought hes never killed a man like this in the hot blood of a knife fight can he do it paul circled slowly right forced by jamis movement the prescient knowledge of the timeboiling variables in this cave came back to plague him now his new understanding told him there were too many swiftly compressed decisions in this fight for any clear channel ahead to show itself variable piled on variablethat was why this cave lay as a blurred nexus in his path it was like a gigantic rock in the flood creating maelstroms in the current around it have an end to it lad stilgar muttered dont play with him paul crept farther into the ring relying on his own edge in speed jamis backed now that the realization swept over himthat this was no soft offworlder in the tahaddi ring easy prey for a fremen crysknife jessica saw the shadow of desperation in the mans face now is when hes most dangerous she thought now hes desperate and can do anything he sees that this is not like a child of his own people but a fighting machine born and trained to it from infancy now the fear i planted in him has come to bloom and she found in herself a sense of pity for jamisan emotion tempered by awareness of the immediate peril to her son jamis could do anything any unpredictable thing she told herself she wondered then if paul had glimpsed this future if he were reliving this experience but she saw the way her son moved the beads of perspiration on his face and shoulders the careful wariness visible in the flow of muscles and for the first time she sensed without understanding it the uncertainty factor in pauls gift paul pressed the fight now circling but not attacking he had seen the fear in his opponent memory of duncan idahos voice flowed through pauls awareness when your opponent fears you thens the moment when you give the fear its own rein give it the time to work on him let it become terror the terrified man fights himself eventually he attacks in desperation that is the most dangerous moment but the terrified man can be trusted usually to make a fatal mistake you are being trained here to detect these mistakes and use them the crowd in the cavern began to mutter they think pauls toying with jamis jessica thought they think pauls being needlessly cruel but she sensed also the undercurrent of crowd excitement their enjoyment of the spectacle and she could see the pressure building up in jamis the moment when it became too much for him to contain was as apparent to her as it was to jamis or to paul jamis leaped high feinting and striking down with his right hand but the hand was empty the crysknife had been shifted to his left hand jessica gasped but paul had been warned by chani jamis fights with either hand and the depth of his training had taken in that trick en passant keep the mind on the knife and not on the hand that holds it gurney halleck had told him time and again the knife is more dangerous than the hand and the knife can be in either hand and paul had seen jamis mistake bad footwork so that it took the man a heartbeat longer to recover from his leap which had been intended to confuse paul and hide the knife shift except for the low yellow light of the glowglobes and the inky eyes of the staring troop it was similar to a session on the practice floor shields didnt count where the bodys own movement could be used against it paul shifted his own knife in a blurred motion slipped sideways and thrust upward where jamis chest was descendingthen away to watch the man crumble jamis fell like a limp rag face down gasped once and turned his face toward paul then lay still on the rock floor his dead eyes stared out like beads of dark glass killing with the point lacks artistry idaho had once told paul but dont let that hold your hand when the opening presents itself the troop rushed forward filling the ring pushing paul aside they hid jamis in a frenzy of huddling activity presently a group of them hurried back into the depths of the cavern carrying a burden wrapped in a robe and there was no body on the rock floor jessica pressed through toward her son she felt that she swam in a sea of robed and stinking backs a throng strangely silent now is the terrible moment she thought he has killed a man in clear superiority of mind and muscle he must not grow to enjoy such a victory she forced herself through the last of the troop and into a small open space where two bearded fremen were helping paul into his stillsuit jessica stared at her son pauls eyes were bright he breathed heavily permitting the ministrations to his body rather than helping them him against jamis and not a mark on him one of the men muttered chani stood at one side her eyes focused on paul jessica saw the girls excitement the admiration in the elfin face it must be done now and swiftly jessica thought she compressed ultimate scorn into her voice and manner said wellll nowhow does it feel to be a killer paul stiffened as though he had been struck he met his mothers cold glare and his face darkened with a rush of blood involuntarily he glanced toward the place on the cavern floor where jamis had lain stilgar pressed through to jessicas side returning from the cave depths where the body of jamis had been taken he spoke to paul in a bitter controlled tone when the time comes for you to call me out and try for my burda do not think you will play with me the way you played with jamis jessica sensed the way her own words and stilgars sank into paul doing their harsh work on the boy the mistake these people madeit served a purpose now she searched the faces around them as paul was doing seeing what he saw admiration yes and fear and in someloathing she looked at stilgar saw his fatalism knew how the fight had seemed to him paul looked at his mother you know what it was he said she heard the return to sanity the remorse in his voice jessica swept her glance across the troop said paul has never before killed a man with a naked blade stilgar faced her disbelief in his face i wasnt playing with him paul said he pressed in front of his mother straightening his robe glanced at the dark place of jamis blood on the cavern floor i did not want to kill him jessica saw belief come slowly to stilgar saw the relief in him as he tugged at his beard with a deeply veined hand she heard muttering awareness spread through the troop thats why y asked him to yield stilgar said i see our ways are different but youll see the sense in them i thought wed admitted a scorpion into our midst he hesitated then and i shall not call you lad the more a voice from the troop called out needs a naming stil stilgar nodded tugging at his beard i see strength in you like the strength beneath a pillar again he paused then you shall be known among us as usul the base of the pillar this is your secret name your troop name we of sietch tabr may use it but none other may so presume usul murmuring went through the troop good choice that strong bring us luck and jessica sensed the acceptance knowing she was included in it with her champion she was indeed sayyadina now what name of manhood do you choose for us to call you openly stilgar asked paul glanced at his mother back to stilgar bits and pieces of this moment registered on his prescient memory but he felt the differences as though they were physical a pressure forcing him through the narrow door of the present how do you call among you the little mouse the mouse that jumps paul asked remembering the pophop of motion at tuono basin he illustrated with one hand a chuckle sounded through the troop we call that one muaddib stilgar said jessica gasped it was the name paul had told her saying that the fremen would accept them and call him thus she felt a sudden fear of her son and for him paul swallowed he felt that he played a part already played over countless times in his mind yet there were differences he could see himself perched on a dizzying summit having experienced much and possessed of a profound store of knowledge but all around him was abyss and again he remembered the vision of fanatic legions following the green and black banner of the atreides pillaging and burning across the universe in the name of their prophet muaddib that must not happen he told himself is that the name you wish muaddib stilgar asked i am an atreides paul whispered and then louder its not right that i give up entirely the name my father gave me could i be known among you as paulmuaddib you are paulmuaddib stilgar said and paul thought that was in no vision of mine i did a different thing but he felt that the abyss remained all around him again a murmuring response went through the troop as man turned to man wisdom with strength couldnt ask more its the legend for sure lisan algaib lisan algaib i will tell you a thing about your new name stilgar said the choice pleases us muaddib is wise in the ways of the desert muaddib creates his own water muaddib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night muaddib is fruitful and multiplies over the land muaddib we call instructorofboys that is a powerful base on which to build your life paulmuaddib who is usul among us we welcome you stilgar touched pauls forehead with one palm withdrew his hand embraced paul and murmured usul as stilgar released him another member of the troop embraced paul repeating his new troop name and paul was passed from embrace to embrace through the troop hearing the voices the shadings of tone usul usul usul already he could place some of them by name and there was chani who pressed her cheek against his as she held him and said his name presently paul stood again before stilgar who said now you are of the ichwan bedwine our brother his face hardened and he spoke with command in his voice and now paulmuaddib tighten up that stillsuit he glanced at chani chani paulmuaddibs nose plugs are as poor a fit ive ever seen i thought i ordered you to see after him i hadnt the makings stil she said theres jamis of course but enough of that then ill share one of mine she said i can make do with one until you will not stilgar said i know there are spares among us where are the spares are we a troop together or a band of savages hands reached out from the troop offering hard fibrous objects stilgar selected four handed them to chani fit these to usul and the sayyadina a voice lifted from the back of the troop what of the water stil what of the literjons in their pack i know your need farok stilgar said he glanced at jessica she nodded broach one for those that need it stilgar said watermaster where is a watermaster ah shimoom care for the measuring of what is needed the necessity and no more this water is the dower property of the sayyadina and will be repaid in the sietch at field rates less pack fees what is the repayment at field rates jessica asked ten for one stilgar said but its a wise rule as youll come to see stilgar said a rustling of robes marked movement at the back of the troop as men turned to get the water stilgar held up a hand and there was silence as to jamis he said i order the full ceremony jamis was our companion and brother of the ichwan bedwine there shall be no turning away without the respect due one who proved our fortune by his tahaddichallenge i invoke the rite at sunset when the dark shall cover him paul hearing these words realized that he had plunged once more into the abyss blind time there was no past occupying the future in his mind except except he could still sense the green and black atreides banner waving somewhere ahead still see the jihads bloody swords and fanatic legions it will not be he told himself i can not let it be god created arrakis to train the faithful from the wisdom of muaddib by the princess irulan in the stillness of the cavern jessica heard the scrape of sand on rock as people moved the distant bird calls that stilgar had said were the signals of his watchmen the great plastic hoodseals had been removed from the caves opening she could see the march of evening shadows across the lip of rock in front of her and the open basin beyond she sensed the daylight leaving them sensed it in the dry heat as well as the shadows she knew her trained awareness soon would give her what these fremen obviously hadthe ability to sense even the slightest change in the airs moisture how they had scurried to tighten their stillsuits when the cave was opened deep within the cave someone began chanting ima trava okolo i korenja okolo jessica translated silently these are ashes and these are roots the funeral ceremony for jamis was beginning she looked out at the arrakeen sunset at the banked decks of color in the sky night was beginning to utter its shadows along the distant rocks and the dunes yet the heat persisted heat forced her thoughts onto water and the observed fact that this whole people could be trained to be thirsty only at given times thirst she could remember moonlit waves on caladan throwing white robes over rocks and the wind heavy with dampness now the breeze that fingered her robes seared the patches of exposed skin at cheeks and forehead the new nose plugs irritated her and she found herself overly conscious of the tube that trailed down across her face into the suit recovering her breaths moisture the suit itself was a sweatbox your suit will be more comfortable when youve adjusted to a lower wafer content in your body stilgar had said she knew he was right but the knowledge made this moment no more comfortable the unconscious preoccupation with water here weighed on her mind no she corrected herself it was preoccupation with moisture and that was a more subtle and profound matter she heard approaching footsteps turned to see paul come out of the caves depths trailed by the elfinfaced chani theres another thing jessica thought paul must be cautioned about their women one of these desert women would not do as wife to a duke as concubine yes but not as wife then she wondered at herself thinking have i been infected with his schemes and she saw how well she had been conditioned i can think of the marital needs of royalty without once weighing my own concubinage yet i was more than concubine mother paul stopped in front of her chani stood at his elbow mother do you know what theyre doing back there jessica looked at the dark patch of his eyes staring out from the hood i think so chani showed me because im supposed to see it and give my permission for the weighing of the water jessica looked at chani theyre recovering jamis water chani said and her thin voice came out nasal past the nose plugs its the rule the flesh belongs to the person but his water belongs to the tribe except in the combat they say the waters mine paul said jessica wondered why this should make her suddenly alert and cautious combat water belongs to the winner chani said its because you have to fight in the open without stillsuits the winner has to get his water back that he loses while fighting i dont want his water paul muttered he felt that he was a part of many images moving simultaneously in a fragmenting way that was disconcerting to the inner eye he could not be certain what he would do but of one thing he was positive he did not want the water distilled out of jamis flesh its water chani said jessica marveled at the way she said it water so much meaning in a simple sound a bene gesserit axiom came to jessicas mind survival is the ability to swim in strange water and jessica thought paul and i we must find the currents and patterns in these strange waters if were to survive you will accept the water jessica said she recognized the tone in her voice she had used that same tone once with leto telling her lost duke that he would accept a large sum offered for his support in a questionable venturebecause money maintained power for the atreides on arrakis water was money she saw that clearly paul remained silent knowing then that he would do as she orderednot because she ordered it but because her tone of voice had forced him to reevaluate to refuse the water would be to break with accepted fremen practice presently paul recalled the words of kalima in yuehs oc bible he said from water does all life begin jessica stared at him where did he learn that quotation she asked herself he hasnt studied the mysteries thus it is spoken chani said giudichar mantene it is written in the shahnama that water was the first of all things created for no reason she could explain and this bothered her more than the sensation jessica suddenly shuddered she turned away to hide her confusion and was just in time to see the sunset a violent calamity of color spilled over the sky as the sun dipped beneath the horizon it is time the voice was stilgars ringing in the cavern jamis weapon has been killed jamis has been called by him by shaihulud who has ordained the phases for the moons that daily wane andin the endappear as bent and withered twigs stilgars voice lowered thus it is with jamis silence fell like a blanket on the cavern jessica saw the grayshadow movement of stilgar like a ghost figure within the dark inner reaches she glanced back at the basin sensing the coolness the friends of jamis will approach stilgar said men moved behind jessica dropping a curtain across the opening a single glowglobe was lighted overhead far back in the cave its yellow glow picked out an inflowing of human figures jessica heard the rustling of the robes chani took a step away as though pulled by the light jessica bent close to pauls ear speaking in the family code follow their lead do as they do it will be a simple ceremony to placate the shade of jamis it will be more than that paul thought and he felt a wrenching sensation within his awareness as though he were trying to grasp some thing in motion and render it motionless chani glided back to jessicas side took her hand come sayyadina we must sit apart paul watched them move off into the shadows leaving him alone he felt abandoned the men who had fixed the curtain came up beside him come usul he allowed himself to be guided forward to be pushed into a circle of people being formed around stilgar who stood beneath the glowglobe and beside a bundled curving and angular shape gathered beneath a robe on the rock floor the troop crouched down at a gesture from stilgar their robes hissing with the movement paul settled with them watching stilgar noting the way the overhead globe made pits of his eyes and brightened the touch of green fabric at his neck paul shifted his attention to the robecovered mound at stilgars feet recognized the handle of a baliset protruding from the fabric the spirit leaves the bodys water when the first moon rises stilgar intoned thus it is spoken when we see the first moon rise this night whom will it summon jamis the troop responded stilgar turned full circle on one heel passing his gaze across the ring of faces i was a friend of jamis he said when the hawk plane stooped upon us at holeintherock it was jamis pulled me to safety he bent over the pile beside him lifted away the robe i take this robe as a friend of jamisleaders right he draped the robe over a shoulder straightening now paul saw the contents of the mound exposed the pale glistening gray of a stillsuit a battered literjon a kerchief with a small book in its center the bladeless handle of a crysknife an empty sheath a folded pack a paracompass a distrans a thumper a pile of fistsized metallic hooks an assortment of what looked like small rocks within a fold of cloth a clump of bundled feathers and the baliset exposed beside the folded pack so jamis played the baliset paul thought the instrument reminded him of gurney halleck and all that was lost paul knew with his memory of the future in the past that some chancelines could produce a meeting with halleck but the reunions were few and shadowed they puzzled him the uncertainty factor touched him with wonder does it mean that something i will do that i may do could destroy gurney or bring him back to life or paul swallowed shook his head again stilgar bent over the mound for jamis woman and for the guards he said the small rocks and the book were taken into the folds of his robe leaders right the troop intoned the marker for jamis coffee service stilgar said and he lifted a flat disc of green metal that it shall be given to usul in suitable ceremony when we return to the sietch leaders right the troop intoned lastly he took the crysknife handle and stood with it for the funeral plain he said for the funeral plain the troop responded at her place in the circle across from paul jessica nodded recognizing the ancient source of the rite and she thought the meeting between ignorance and knowledge between brutality and cultureit begins in the dignity with which we treat our dead she looked across at paul wondering will he see it will he know what to do we are friends of jamis stilgar said we are not wailing for our dead like a pack of garvarg a graybearded man to pauls left stood up i was a friend of jamis he said he crossed to the mound lifted the distrans when our water went below minim at the siege at two birds jamis shared the man returned to his place in the circle am i supposed to say i was a friend of jamis paul wondered do they expect me to take something from that pile he saw faces turn toward him turn away they do expect it another man across from paul arose went to the pack and removed the paracompass i was a friend of jamis he said when the patrol caught us at bightofthecliff and i was wounded jamis drew them off so the wounded could be saved he returned to his place in the circle again the faces turned toward paul and he saw the expectancy in them lowered his eyes an elbow nudged him and a voice hissed would you bring the destruction on us how can i say i was his friend paul wondered another figure arose from the circle opposite paul and as the hooded face came into the light he recognized his mother she removed a kerchief from the mount i was a friend of jamis she said when the spirit of spirits within him saw the needs of truth that spirit withdrew and spared my son she returned to her place and paul recalled the scorn in his mothers voice as she had confronted him after the fight how does it f eel to be a killer again he saw the faces turned toward him felt the anger and fear in the troop a passage his mother had once filmbooked for him on the cult of the dead flickered through pauls mind he knew what he had to do slowly paul got to his feet a sigh passed around the circle paul felt the diminishment of his self as he advanced into the center of the circle it was as though he lost a fragment of himself and sought it here he bent over the mound of belongings lifted out the baliset a string twanged softly as it struck against something in the pile i was a friend of jamis paul whispered he felt tears burning his eyes forced more volume into his voice jamis taught me that when you kill you pay for it i wish id known jamis better blindly he groped his way back to his place in the circle sank to the rock floor a voice hissed he sheds tears it was taken up around the ring usul gives moisture to the dead he felt fingers touch his damp cheek heard the awed whispers jessica hearing the voices felt the depth of the experience realized what terrible inhibitions there must be against shedding tears she focused on the words he gives moisture to the dead it was a gift to the shadow worldtears they would be sacred beyond a doubt nothing on this planet had so forcefully hammered into her the ultimate value of water not the watersellers not the dried skins of the natives not stillsuits or the rules of water discipline here there was a substance more precious than all othersit was life itself and entwined all around with symbolism and ritual water i touched his cheek someone whispered i felt the gift at first the fingers touching his face frightened paul he clutched the cold handle of the baliset feeling the strings bite his palm then he saw the faces beyond the groping handsthe eyes wide and wondering presently the hands withdrew the funeral ceremony resumed but now there was a subtle space around paul a drawing back as the troop honored him by a respectful isolation the ceremony ended with a low chant full moon calls thee shaihulud shall thou see red the night dusky sky bloody death didst thou die we pray to a moon she is round luck with us will then abound what we seek for shall be found in the land of solid ground a bulging sack remained at stilgars feet he crouched placed his palms against it someone came up beside him crouched at his elbow and paul recognized chanis face in the hood shadow jamis carried thirtythree liters and seven and threethirtyseconds drachms of the tribes water chani said i bless it now in the presence of a sayyadina ekkeriakairi this is the water fillissinfollasy of paulmuaddib kivi akavi never the more nakalas nakelas to be measured and counted ukairan by the heartbeats janjanjan of our friend jamis in an abrupt and profound silence chani turned stared at paul presently she said where i am flame be thou the coals where i am dew be thou the water bilal kaifa intoned the troop to paulmuaddib goes this portion chani said may he guard it for the tribe preserving it against careless loss may he be generous with it in time of need may he pass it on in his time for the good of the tribe bilal kaifa intoned the troop i must accept that water paul thought slowly he arose made his way to chanis side stilgar stepped back to make room for him took the baliset gently from his hand kneel chani said paul knelt she guided his hands to the waterbag held them against the resilient surface with this water the tribe entrusts thee she said jamis is gone from it take it in peace she stood pulling paul up with her stilgar returned the baliset extended a small pile of metal rings in one palm paul looked at them seeing the different sizes the way the light of the glowglobe reflected off them chani took the largest ring held it on a finger thirty liters she said one by one she took the others showing each to paul counting them two liters one liter seven watercounters of one drachm each one watercounter of threethirtyseconds drachms in allthirtythree liters and seven and threethirtyseconds drachms she held them up on her finger for paul to see do you accept them stilgar asked paul swallowed nodded yes later chani said i will show you how to tie them in a kerchief so they wont rattle and give you away when you need silence she extended her hand will you hold them for me paul asked chani turned a startled glance on stilgar he smiled said paulmuaddib who is usul does not yet know our ways chani hold his watercounters without commitment until its time to show him the manner of carrying them she nodded whipped a ribbon of cloth from beneath her robe linked the rings onto it with an intricate over and under weaving hesitated then stuffed them into the sash beneath her robe i missed something there paul thought he sensed the feeling of humor around him something bantering in it and his mind linked up a prescient memory watercounters offered to a womancourtship ritual watermasters stilgar said the troop arose in a hissing of robes two men stepped out lifted the waterbag stilgar took down the glowglobe led the way with it into the depths of the cave paul was pressed in behind chani noted the buttery glow of light over rock walls the way the shadows danced and he felt the troops lift of spirits contained in a hushed air of expectancy jessica pulled into the end of the troop by eager hands hemmed around by jostling bodies suppressed a moment of panic she had recognized fragments of the ritual identified the shards of chakobsa and bhotanijib in the words and she knew the wild violence that could explode out of these seemingly simple moments janjanjan she thought gogogo it was like a childs game that had lost all inhibition in adult hands stilgar stopped at a yellow rock wall he pressed an outcropping and the wall swung silently away from him opening along an irregular crack he led the way through past a dark honeycomb lattice that directed a cool wash of air across paul when he passed it paul turned a questioning stare on chani tugged her arm that air felt damp he said shhhh she whispered but a man behind them said plenty of moisture in the trap tonight jamis way of telling us hes satisfied jessica passed through the secret door heard it close behind she saw how the fremen slowed while passing the honeycomb lattice felt the dampness of the air as she came opposite it windtrap she thought theyve a concealed windtrap somewhere on the surface to funnel air down here into cooler regions and precipitate the moisture from it they passed through another rock door with latticework above it and the door closed behind them the draft of air at their backs carried a sensation of moisture clearly perceptible to both jessica and paul at the head of the troop the glowglobe in stilgars hands dropped below the level of the heads in front of paul presently he felt steps beneath his feet curving down to the left light reflected back up across hooded heads and a winding movement of people spiraling down the steps jessica sensed mounting tension in the people around her a pressure of silence that rasped her nerves with its urgency the steps ended and the troop passed through another low door the light of the glowglobe was swallowed in a great open space with a high curved ceiling paul felt chanis hand on his arm heard a faint dripping sound in the chill air felt an utter stillness come over the fremen in the cathedral presence of water i have seen this place in a dream he thought the thought was both reassuring and frustrating somewhere ahead of him on this path the fanatic hordes cut their gory path across the universe in his name the green and black atreides banner would become a symbol of terror wild legions would charge into battle screaming their war cry muaddib it must not be he thought i can not let it happen but he could feel the demanding race consciousness within him his own terrible purpose and he knew that no small thing could deflect the juggernaut it was gathering weight and momentum if he died this instant the thing would go on through his mother and his unborn sister nothing less than the deaths of all the troop gathered here and nowhimself and his mother includedcould stop the thing paul stared around him saw the troop spread out in a line they pressed him forward against a low barrier carved from native rock beyond the barrier in the glow of stilgars globe paul saw an unruffled dark surface of water it stretched away into shadowsdeep and blackthe far wall only faintly visible perhaps a hundred meters away jessica felt the dry pulling of skin on her cheeks and forehead relaxing in the presence of moisture the water pool was deep she could sense its deepness and resisted a desire to dip her hands into it a splashing sounded on her left she looked down the shadowy line of fremen saw stilgar with paul standing beside him and the watermasters emptying their load into the pool through a flowmeter the meter was a round gray eye above the pools rim she saw its glowing pointer move as the water flowed through it saw the pointer stop at thirtythree liters seven and threethirtyseconds drachms superb accuracy in water measurement jessica thought and she noted that the walls of the meter trough held no trace of moisture after the waters passage the water flowed off those walls without binding tension she saw a profound clue to fremen technology in the simple fact they were perfectionists jessica worked her way down the barrier to stilgars side way was made for her with casual courtesy she noted the withdrawn look in pauls eyes but the mystery of this great pool of water dominated her thoughts stilgar looked at her there were those among us in need of water he said yet they would come here and not touch this water do you know that i believe it she said he looked at the pool we have more than thirtyeight million decaliters here he said walled off from the little makers hidden and preserved a treasure trove she said stilgar lifted the globe to look into her eyes it is greater than treasure we have thousands of such caches only a few of us know them all he cocked his head to one side the globe cast a yellowshadowed glow across face and beard hear that they listened the dripping of water precipitated from the windtrap filled the room with its presence jessica saw that the entire troop was caught up in a rapture of listening only paul seemed to stand remote from it to paul the sound was like moments ticking away he could feel time flowing through him the instants never to be recaptured he sensed a need for decision but felt powerless to move it has been calculated with precision stilgar whispered we know to within a million decaliters how much we need when we have it we shall change the face of arrakis a hushed whisper of response lifted from the troop bilal kaifa we will trap the dunes beneath grass plantings stilgar said his voice growing stronger we will tie the water into the soil with trees and undergrowth bilal kaifa intoned the troop each year the polar ice retreats stilgar said bilal kaifa they chanted we shall make a homeworld of arrakiswith melting lenses at the poles with lakes in the temperate zones and only the deep desert for the maker and his spice bilal kaifa and no man ever again shall want for water it shall be his for dipping from well or pond or lake or canal it shall run down through the qanats to feed our plants it shall be there for any man to take it shall be his for holding out his hand bilal kaifa jessica felt the religious ritual in the words noted her own instinctively awed response theyre in league with the future she thought they have their mountain to climb this is the scientists dream and these simple people these peasants are filled with it her thoughts turned to lietkynes the emperors planetary ecologist the man who had gone nativeand she wondered at him this was a dream to capture mens souls and she could sense the hand of the ecologist in it this was a dream for which men would die willingly it was another of the essential ingredients that she felt her son needed people with a goal such people would be easy to imbue with fervor and fanaticism they could be wielded like a sword to win back pauls place for him we leave now stilgar said and wait for the first moons rising when jamis is safely on his way we will go home whispering their reluctance the troop fell in behind him turned back along the water barrier and up the stairs and paul walking behind chani felt that a vital moment had passed him that he had missed an essential decision and was now caught up in his own myth he knew he had seen this place before experienced it in a fragment of prescient dream on faraway caladan but details of the place were being filled in now that he had not seen he felt a new sense of wonder at the limits of his gift it was as though he rode within the wave of time sometimes in its trough sometimes on a crestand all around him the other waves lifted and fell revealing and then hiding what they bore on their surface through it all the wild jihad still loomed ahead of him the violence and the slaughter it was like a promontory above the surf the troop filed through the last door into the main cavern the door was sealed lights were extinguished hoods removed from the cavern openings revealing the night and the stars that had come over the desert jessica moved to the dry lip of the caverns edge looked up at the stars they were sharp and near she felt the stirring of the troop around her heard the sound of a baliset being tuned somewhere behind her and pauls voice humming the pitch there was a melancholy in his tone that she did not like chanis voice intruded from the deep cave darkness tell me about the waters of your birthworld paul muaddib and paul another time chani i promise such sadness its a good baliset chani said very good paul said do you think jamisll mind my using it he speaks of the dead in the present tense jessica thought the implications disturbed her a mans voice intruded he liked music betimes jamis did then sing me one of your songs chani pleaded such feminine allure in that girlchilds voice jessica thought i must caution paul about their women and soon this was a song of a friend of mine paul said i expect hes dead now gurney is he called it his evensong the troop grew still listening as pauls voice lifted in a sweet boy tenor with the baliset tinkling and strumming beneath it this clear time of seeing embers a goldbright suns lost in first dusk what frenzied senses desprate musk are consort of remembring jessica felt the verbal music in her breastpagan and charged with sounds that made her suddenly and intensely aware of herself feeling her own body and its needs she listened with a tense stillness nights pearlcensered requiem tis for us what joys run then bright in your eyes what flowerspangled amores pull at our hearts what flowerspangled amores fill our desires and jessica heard the afterstillness that hummed in the air with the last note why does my son sing a love song to that girlchild she asked herself she felt an abrupt fear she could sense life flowing around her and she had no grasp on its reins why did he choose that song she wondered the instincts are true sometimes why did he do this paul sat silently in the darkness a single stark thought dominating his awareness my mother is my enemy she does not know it but she is she is bringing the jihad she bore me she trained me she is my enemy the concept of progress acts as a protective mechanism to shield us from the terrors of the future from collected sayings of muaddib by the princess irulan on his seventeenth birthday feydrautha harkonnen killed his one hundredth slavegladiator in the family games visiting observers from the imperial courta count and lady fenringwere on the harkonnen homeworld of giedi prime for the event invited to sit that afternoon with the immediate family in the golden box above the triangular arena in honor of the nabarons nativity and to remind all harkonnens and subjects that feydrautha was heirdesignate it was holiday on giedi prime the old baron had decreed a meridiantomeridian rest from labors and effort had been spent in the family city of harko to create the illusion of gaiety banners flew from buildings new paint had been splashed on the walls along court way but off the main way count fenring and his lady noted the rubbish heaps the scabrous brown walls reflected in the dark puddles of the streets and the furtive scurrying of the people in the barons bluewalled keep there was fearful perfection but the count and his lady saw the price being paidguards everywhere and weapons with that special sheen that told a trained eye they were in regular use there were checkpoints for routine passage from area to area even within the keep the servants revealed their military training in the way they walked in the set of their shoulders in the way their eyes watched and watched and watched the pressures on the count hummed to his lady in their secret language the baron is just beginning to see the price he really paid to rid himself of the duke leto sometime i must recount for you the legend of the phoenix she said they were in the reception hall of the keep waiting to go to the family games it was not a large hallperhaps forty meters long and half that in widthbut false pillars along the sides had been shaped with an abrupt taper and the ceiling had a subtle arch all giving the illusion of much greater space ahhh here comes the baron the count said the baron moved down the length of the hall with that peculiar waddlingglide imparted by the necessities of guiding suspensorhung weight his jowls bobbed up and down the suspensors jiggled and shifted beneath his orange robe rings glittered on his hands and opafires shone where they had been woven into the robe at the barons elbow walked feydrautha his dark hair was dressed in close ringlets that seemed incongruously gay above sullen eyes he wore a tightfitting black tunic and snug trousers with a suggestion of bell at the bottom softsoled slippers covered his small feet lady fenring noting the young mans poise and the sure flow of muscles beneath the tunic thought heres one who wont let himself go to fat the baron stopped in front of them took feydrauthas arm in a possessive grip said my nephew the nabaron feydrautha harkonnen and turning his babyfat face toward feydrautha he said the count and lady fenring of whom ive spoken feydrautha dipped his head with the required courtesy he stared at the lady fenring she was goldenhaired and willowy her perfection of figure clothed in a flowing gown of ecrusimple fitness of form without ornament graygreen eyes stared back at him she had that bene gesserit serene repose about her that the young man found subtly disturbing ummmmahhmmmm said the count he studied feydrautha the hmmmm precise young man ah my hmmmm dear the count glanced at the baron my dear baron you say youve spoken of us to this precise young man what did you say i told my nephew of the great esteem our emperor holds for you count fenring the baron said and he thought mark him well feyd a killer with the manners of a rabbitthis is the most dangerous kind of course said the count and he smiled at his lady feydrautha found the mans actions and words almost insulting they stopped just short of something overt that would require notice the young man focused his attention on the count a small man weaklooking the face was weaselish with overlarge dark eyes there was gray at the temples and his movementshe moved a hand or turned his head one way then he spoke another way it was difficult to follow ummmmmahhhhmmm you come upon such mmmm preciseness so rarely the count said addressing the barons shoulder i ah congratulate you on the hmmm perfection of your ahhh heir in the light of the hmmm elder one might say you are too kind the baron said he bowed but feydrautha noted that his uncles eyes did not agree with the courtesy when youre mmmm ironic that ahhh suggests youre hmmmm thinking deep thoughts the count said there he goes again feydrautha thought it sounds like hes being insulting but theres nothing you can call out for satisfaction listening to the man gave feydrautha the feeling his head was being pushed through mush ummmahhhhmmmm feydrautha turned his attention back to the lady fenring were ahhh taking up too much of this young mans time she said i understand hes to appear in the arena today by the houris of the imperial hareem shes a lovely one feydrautha thought he said i shall make a kill for you this day my lady i shall make the dedication in the arena with your permission she returned his stare serenely but her voice carried whiplash as she said you do not have my permission feyd the baron said and he thought that imp does he want this deadly count to call him out but the count only smiled and said hmmmmummm you really must be getting ready for the arena feyd the baron said you must be rested and not take any foolish risks feydrautha bowed his face dark with resentment im sure everything will be as you wish uncle he nodded to count fenring sir to the lady my lady and he turned strode out of the hall barely glancing at the knot of families minor near the double doors hes so young the baron sighed ummmmah indeed hmmm the count said and the lady fenring thought can that be the young man the reverend mother meant is that a bloodline we must preserve weve more than an hour before going to the arena the baron sad perhaps we could have our little talk now count fenring he tipped his gross head to the right theres a considerable amount of progress to be discussed and the baron thought let us see now how the emperors errand boy gets across whatever message he carries without ever being so crass as to speak it right out the count spoke to his lady ummmmahhhhmmm you mmm will ahhh excuse us my dear each day some time each hour brings change she said mmmmm and she smiled sweetly at the baron before turning away her long skirts swished and she walked with a straightbacked regal stride toward the double doors at the end of the hall the baron noted how all conversation among the houses minor there stopped at her approach how the eyes followed her bene gesserit the baron thought the universe would be better rid of them all theres a cone of silence between two of the pillars over here on our left the baron said we can talk there without fear of being overheard he led the way with his waddling gait into the sounddeadening field feeling the noises of the keep become dull and distant the count moved up beside the baron and they turned facing the wall so their lips could not be read were not satisfied with the way you ordered the sardaukar off arrakis the count said straight talk the baron thought the sardaukar could not stay longer without risking that others would find out how the emperor helped me the baron said but your nephew rabban does not appear to be pressing strongly enough toward a solution of the fremen problem what does the emperor wish the baron asked there can not be more than a handful of fremen left on arrakis the southern desert is uninhabitable the northern desert is swept regularly by our patrols who says the southern desert is uninhabitable your own planetologist said it my dear count but doctor kynes is dead ah yes unfortunate that weve word from an overflight across the southern reaches the count said theres evidence of plant life has the guild then agreed to a watch from space you know better than that baron the emperor can not legally post a watch on arrakis and i can not afford it the baron said who made this overflight a smuggler someone has lied to you count the baron said smugglers can not navigate the southern reaches any better than can rabbans men storms sandstatic and all that you know navigation markers are knocked out faster than they can be installed well discuss various types of static another time the count said ahhhh the baron thought have you found some mistake in my accounting then he demanded when you imagine mistakes there can be no selfdefense the count said hes deliberately trying to arouse my anger the baron thought he took two deep breaths to calm himself he could smell his own sweat and the harness of the suspensors beneath his robe felt suddenly itchy and galling the emperor can not be unhappy about the death of the concubine and the boy the baron said they fled into the desert there was a storm yes there were so many convenient accidents the count agreed i do not like your tone count the baron said anger is one thing violence another the count said let me caution you should an unfortunate accident occur to me here the great houses all would learn what you did on arrakis theyve long suspected how you do business the only recent business i can recall the baron said was transportation of several legions of sardaukar to arrakis you think you could hold that over the emperors head i wouldnt think of it the count smiled sardaukar commanders could be found whod confess they acted without orders because they wanted a battle with your fremen scum many might doubt such a confession the baron said but the threat staggered him are sardaukar truly that disciplined he wondered the emperor does wish to audit your books the count said any time you ah have no objections none my choam company directorship will bear the closest scrutiny and he thought let him bring a false accusation against me and have it exposed i shall stand there promethean saying behold me i am wronged then let him bring any other accusation against me even a true one the great houses will not believe a second attack from an accuser once proved wrong no doubt your books will bear the closest scrutiny the count muttered why is the emperor so interested in exterminating the fremen the baron asked you wish the subject to be changed eh the count shrugged it is the sardaukar who wish it not the emperor they needed practice in killing and they hate to see a task left undone does he think to frighten me by reminding me that he is supported by bloodthirsty killers the baron wondered a certain amount of killing has always been an arm of business the baron said but a line has to be drawn somewhere someone must be left to work the spice the count emitted a short barking laugh you think you can harness the fremen there never were enough of them for that the baron said but the killing has made the rest of my population uneasy its reaching the point where im considering another solution to the arrakeen problem my dear fenring and i must confess the emperor deserves credit for the inspiration ahhh you see count i have the emperors prison planet salusa secundus to inspire me the count stared at him with glittering intensity what possible connection is there between arrakis and salusa secundus the baron felt the alertness in fenrings eyes said no connection yet yet you must admit itd be a way to develop a substantial work force on arrakisuse the place as a prison planet you anticipate an increase in prisoners there has been unrest the baron admitted ive had to squeeze rather severely fenring after all you know the price i paid that damnable guild to transport our mutual force to arrakis that money has to come from somewhere i suggest you not use arrakis as a prison planet without the emperors permission baron of course not the baron said and he wondered at the sudden chill in fenrings voice another matter the count said we learn that duke letos mentat thufir hawat is not dead but in your employ i could not bring myself to waste him the baron said you lied to our sardaukar commander when you said hawat was dead only a white lie my dear count i hadnt the stomach for a long argument with the man was hawat the real traitor oh goodness no it was the false doctor the baron wiped at perspiration on his neck you must understand fenring i was without a mentat you know that ive never been without a mentat it was most unsettling how could you get hawat to shift allegiance his duke was dead the baron forced a smile theres nothing to fear from hawat my dear count the mentats flesh has been impregnated with a latent poison we administer an antidote in his meals without the antidote the poison is triggeredhed die in a few days withdraw the antidote the count said but hes useful and he knows too many things no living man should know you said the emperor doesnt fear exposure dont play games with me baron when i see such an order above the imperial seal ill obey it the baron said but ill not submit to your whim you think it whim what else can it be the emperor has obligations to me too fenring i rid him of the troublesome duke with the help of a few sardaukar where else would the emperor have found a house to provide the disguising uniforms to hide his hand in this matter he has asked himself the same question baron but with a slightly different emphasis the baron studied fenring noting the stiffness of jaw muscles the careful control ahhh now the baron said i hope the emperor doesnt believe he can move against me in total secrecy he hopes it wont become necessary the emperor can not believe i threaten him the baron permitted anger and grief to edge his voice thinking let him wrong me in that i could place myself on the throne while still beating my breast over how id been wronged the counts voice went dry and remote as he said the emperor believes what his senses tell him dare the emperor charge me with treason before a full landsraad council and the baron held his breath with the hope of it the emperor need dare nothing the baron whirled away in his suspensors to hide his expression it could happen in my lifetime he thought emperor let him wrong me thenthe bribes and coercion the rallying of the great houses theyd flock to my banner like peasants running for shelter the thing they fear above all else is the emperors sardaukar loosed upon them one house at a time its the emperors sincere hope hell never have to charge you with treason the count said the baron found it difficult to keep irony out of his voice and permit only the expression of hurt but he managed ive been a most loyal subject these words hurt me beyond my capacity to express ummmmahhmmm said the count the baron kept his back to the count nodding presently he said its time to go to the arena indeed said the count they moved out of the cone of silence and side by side walked toward the clumps of houses minor at the end of the hall a bell began a slow tolling somewhere in the keeptwentyminute warning for the arena gathering the houses minor wait for you to lead them the count said nodding toward the people they approached double meaning double meaning the baron thought he looked up at the new talismans flanking the exit to his hallthe mounted bulls head and the oil painting of the old duke atreides the late duke letos father they filled the baron with an odd sense of foreboding and he wondered what thoughts these talismans had inspired in the duke leto as they hung in the halls of caladan and then on arrakisthe bravura father and the head of the bull that had killed him mankind has ah only one mmmm science the count said as they picked up their parade of followers and emerged from the hall into the waiting rooma narrow space with high windows and floor of patterned white and purple tile and what science is that the baron asked its the ummmahh science of ahhh discontent the count said the houses minor behind them sheepfaced and responsive laughed with just the right tone of appreciation but the sound carried a note of discord as it collided with the sudden blast of motors that came to them when pages threw open the outer doors revealing the line of ground cars their guidon pennants whipping in a breeze the baron raised his voice to surmount the sudden noise said i hope youll not be discontented with the performance of my nephew today count fenring i ahhh am filled ummm only with a hmmm sense of anticipation yes the count said always in the ahhh process verbal one ummm ahhh must consider the ahhh office of origin the baron hid his sudden stiffening of surprise by stumbling on the first step down from the exit process verbal that was a report of a crime against the imperium but the count chuckled to make it seem a joke and patted the barons arm all the way to the arena though the baron sat back among the armored cushions of his car casting covert glances at the count beside him wondering why the emperors errand boy had thought it necessary to make that particular kind of joke in front of the houses minor it was obvious that fenring seldom did anything he felt to be unnecessary or used two words where one would do or held himself to a single meaning in a single phrase they were seated in the golden box above the triangular arenahorns blaring the tiers above and around them jammed with a hubbub of people and waving pennantswhen the answer came to the baron my dear baron the count said leaning close to his ear you know dont you that the emperor has not given official sanction to your choice of heir the baron felt himself to be within a sudden personal cone of silence produced by his own shock he stared at fenring barely seeing the counts lady come through the guards beyond to join the party in the golden box thats really why im here today the count said the emperor wishes me to report on whether youve chosen a worthy successor theres nothing like the arena to expose the true person from beneath the mask eh the emperor promised me free choice of heir the baron grated we shall see fenring said and turned away to greet his lady she sat down smiling at the baron then giving her attention to the sand floor beneath them where feydrautha was emerging in giles and tightsthe black glove and the long knife in his right hand the white glove and the short knife in his left hand white for poison black for purity the lady fenring said a curious custom isnt it my love ummmm the count said the greeting cheer lifted from the family galleries and feydrautha paused to accept it looking up and scanning the facesseeing his cousines and cousins the demibrothers the concubines and outfreyn relations they were so many pink trumpet mouths yammering amidst a flutter of colorful clothing and banners it came to feydrautha then that the packed ranks of faces would look just as avidly at his blood as at that of the slavegladiator there was not a doubt of the outcome in this fight of course here was only the form of danger without its substanceyet feydrautha held up his knives to the sun saluted the three corners of the arena in the ancient manner the short knife in whitegloved hand white the sign of poison went first into its sheath then the long blade in the blackgloved handthe pure blade that now was unpure his secret weapon to turn this day into a purely personal victory poison on the black blade the adjustment of his body shield took only a moment and he paused to sense the skintightening at his forehead assuring him he was properly guarded this moment carried its own suspense and feydrautha dragged it out with the sure hand of a showman nodding to his handlers and distracters checking their equipment with a measuring staregyves in place with their prickles sharp and glistening the barbs and hooks waving with their blue streamers feydrautha signaled the musicians the slow march began sonorous with its ancient pomp and feydrautha led his troupe across the arena for obeisance at the foot of his uncles box he caught the ceremonial key as it was thrown the music stopped into the abrupt silence he stepped back two paces raised the key and shouted i dedicate this truth to and he paused knowing his uncle would think the young fools going to dedicate to lady fenring after all and cause a ruckus to my uncle and patron the baron vladimir harkonnen feydrautha shouted and he was delighted to see his uncle sigh the music resumed at the quickmarch and feydrautha led his men scampering back across the arena to the prudence door that admitted only those wearing the proper identification band feydrautha prided himself that he never used the prudoor and seldom needed distracters but it was good to know they were available this dayspecial plans sometimes involved special dangers again silence settled over the arena feydrautha turned faced the big red door across from him through which the gladiator would emerge the special gladiator the plan thufir hawat had devised was admirably simple and direct feydrautha thought the slave would not be druggedthat was the danger instead a key word had been drummed into the mans unconscious to immobilize his muscles at a critical instant feydrautha rolled the vital word in his mind mouthing it without sound scum to the audience it would appear that an undrugged slave had been slipped into the arena to kill the nabaron and all the carefully arranged evidence would point to the slavemaster a low humming arose from the red doors servomotors as they were armed for opening feydrautha focused all his awareness on the door this first moment was the critical one the appearance of the gladiator as he emerged told the trained eye much it needed to know all gladiators were supposed to be hyped on elacca drug to come out killready in fighting stancebut you had to watch how they hefted the knife which way they turned in defense whether they were actually aware of the audience in the stands the way a slave cocked his head could give the most vital clue to counter and feint the red door slammed open out charged a tall muscular man with shaved head and darkly pitted eyes his skin was carrotcolored as it should be from the elacca drug but feydrautha knew the color was paint the slave wore green leotards and the red belt of a semishieldthe belts arrow pointing left to indicate the slaves left side was shielded he held his knife swordfashion cocked slightly outward in the stance of a trained fighter slowly he advanced into the arena turning his shielded side toward feydrautha and the group at the prudoor i like not the look of this one said one of feydrauthas barbmen are you sure hes drugged mlord he has the color feydrautha said yet he stands like a fighter said another helper feydrautha advanced two steps onto the sand studied this slave what has he done to his arm asked one of the distracters feydrauthas attention went to a bloody scratch on the mans left forearm followed the arm down to the hand as it pointed to a design drawn in blood on the left hip of the green leotardsa wet shape there the formalized outline of a hawk hawk feydrautha looked up into the darkly pitted eyes saw them glaring at him with uncommon alertness its one of duke letos fighting men we took on arrakis feydrautha thought no simple gladiator this a chill ran through him and he wondered if hawat had another plan for this arenaa feint within a feint within a feint and only the slavemaster prepared to take the blame feydrauthas chief handler spoke at his ear i like not the look on that one mlord let me set a barb or two in his knife arm to try him ill set my own barbs feydrautha said he took a pair of the long hooked shafts from the handler hefted them testing the balance these barbs too were supposed to be druggedbut not this time and the chief handler might die because of that but it was all part of the plan youll come out of this a hero hawat had said killed your gladiator man to man and in spite of treachery the slavemaster will be executed and your man will step into his spot feydrautha advanced another five paces into the arena playing out the moment studying the slave already he knew the experts in the stands above him were aware that something was wrong the gladiator had the correct skin color for a drugged man but he stood his ground and did not tremble the aficionados would be whispering among themselves now see how he stands he should be agitatedattacking or retreating see how he conserves his strength how he waits he should not wait feydrautha felt his own excitement kindle let there be treachery in hawats mind he thought i can handle this slave and its my long knife that carries the poison this time not the short one even hawat doesnt know that hai harkonnen the slave called are you prepared to die deathly stillness gripped the arena slaves did not issue the challenge now feydrautha had a clear view of the gladiators eyes saw the cold ferocity of despair in them he marked the way the man stood loose and ready muscles prepared for victory the slave grapevine had carried hawats message to this one youll get a true chance to kill the nabaron that much of the scheme was as theyd planned it then a tight smile crossed feydrauthas mouth he lifted the barbs seeing success for his plans in the way the gladiator stood hai hai the slave challenged and crept forward two steps no one in the galleries can mistake it now feydrautha thought this slave should have been partly crippled by druginduced terror every movement should have betrayed his inner knowledge that there was no hope for himhe could not win he should have been filled with the stories of the poisons the nabaron chose for the blade in his whitegloved hand the nabaron never gave quick death he delighted in demonstrating rare poisons could stand in the arena pointing out interesting side effects on a writhing victim there was fear in the slave yesbut not terror feydrautha lifted the barbs high nodded in an almostgreeting the gladiator pounced his feint and defensive counter were as good as any feydrautha had ever seen a timed side blow missed by the barest fraction from severing the tendons of the nabarons left leg feydrautha danced away leaving a barbed shaft in the slaves right forearm the hooks completely buried in flesh where the man could not withdraw them without ripping tendons a concerted gasp lifted from the galleries the sound filled feydrautha with elation he knew now what his uncle was experiencing sitting up there with the fenrings the observers from the imperial court beside him there could be no interference with this fight the forms must be observed in front of witnesses and the baron would interpret the events in the arena only one waythreat to himself the slave backed holding knife in teeth and lashing the barbed shaft to his arm with the pennant i do not feel your needle he shouted again he crept forward knife ready left side presented his body bent backward to give it the greatest surface of protection from the halfshield that action too didnt escape the galleries sharp cries came from the family boxes feydrauthas handlers were calling out to ask if he needed them he waved them back to the prudoor ill give them a show such as theyve never had before feydrautha thought no tame killing where they can sit back and admire the style thisll be something to take them by the guts and twist them when im baron theyll remember this day and wont be a one of them can escape fear of me because of this day feydrautha gave ground slowly before the gladiators crablike advance arena sand grated underfoot he heard the slaves panting smelled his own sweat and a faint odor of blood on the air steadily the nabaron moved backward turning to the right his second barb ready the slave danced sideways feydrautha appeared to stumble heard the scream from the galleries again the slave pounced gods what a fighting man feydrautha thought as he leaped aside only youths quickness saved him but he left the second barb buried in the deltoid muscle of the slaves right arm shrill cheers rained from the galleries they cheer me now feydrautha thought he heard the wildness in the voices just as hawat had said he would theyd never cheered a family fighter that way before and he thought with an edge of grimness on a thing hawat had told him its easier to be terrified by an enemy you admire swiftly feydrautha retreated to the center of the arena where all could see clearly he drew his long blade crouched and waited for the advancing slave the man took only the time to lash the second barb tight to his arm then sped in pursuit let the family see me do this thing feydrautha thought i am their enemy let them think of me as they see me now he drew his short blade i do not fear you harkonnen swine the gladiator said your tortures can not hurt a dead man i can be dead on my own blade before a handler lays finger to my flesh and ill have you dead beside me feydrautha grinned offered now the long blade the one with the poison try this one he said and feinted with the short blade in his other hand the slave shifted knife hands turned inside both parry and feint to grapple the nabarons short bladethe one in the white gloved hand that tradition said should carry the poison you will die harkonnen the gladiator gasped they struggled sideways across the sand where feydrauthas shield met the slaves halfshield a blue glow marked the contact the air around them filled with ozone from the field die on your own poison the slave grated he began forcing the whitegloved hand inward turning the blade he thought carried the poison let them see this feydrautha thought he brought down the long blade felt it clang uselessly against the barbed shaft lashed to the slaves arm feydrautha felt a moment of desperation he had not thought the barbed shafts would be an advantage for the slave but they gave the man another shield and the strength of this gladiator the short blade was being forced inward inexorably and feydrautha focused on the fact that a man could also die on an unpoisoned blade scum feydrautha gasped at the key word the gladiators muscles obeyed with a momentary slackness it was enough for feydrautha he opened a space between them sufficient for the long blade its poisoned tip flicked out drew a red line down the slaves chest there was instant agony in the poison the man disengaged himself staggered backward now let my dear family watch feydrautha thought let them think on this slave who tried to turn the knife he thought poisoned and use it against me let them wonder how a gladiator could come into this arena ready for such an attempt and let them always be aware they can not know for sure which of my hands carries the poison feydrautha stood in silence watching the slowed motions of the slave the man moved within a hesitationawareness there was an orthographic thing on his face now for every watcher to recognize the death was written there the slave knew it had been done to him and he knew how it had been done the wrong blade had carried the poison you the man moaned feydrautha drew back to give death its space the paralyzing drug in the poison had yet to take full effect but the mans slowness told of its advance the slave staggered forward as though drawn by a stringone dragging step at a time each step was the only step in his universe he still clutched his knife but its point wavered one day one of us will get you he gasped a sad little moue contorted his mouth he sat sagged then stiffened and rolled away from feydrautha face down feydrautha advanced in the silent arena put a toe under the gladiator and rolled him onto his back to give the galleries a clear view of the face when the poison began its twisting wrenching work on the muscles but the gladiator came over with his own knife protruding from his breast in spite of frustration there was for feydrautha a measure of admiration for the effort this slave had managed in overcoming the paralysis to do this thing to himself with the admiration came the realization that here was truly a thing to fear that which makes a man superhuman is terrifying as he focused on this thought feydrautha became conscious of the eruption of noise from the stands and galleries around him they were cheering with utter abandon feydrautha turned looking up at them all were cheering except the baron who sat with hand to chin in deep contemplationand the count and his lady both of whom were staring down at him their faces masked by smiles count fenring turned to his lady said ahhhummm a resourceful ummmm young man eh mmmmah my dear his ahhh synaptic responses are very swift she said the baron looked at her at the count returned his attention to the arena thinking if someone could get that close to one of mine rage began to replace his fear ill have the slavemaster dead over a slow fire this night and if this count and his lady had a hand in it the conversation in the barons box was remote movement to feydrautha the voices drowned in the footstamping chant that came now from all around head head head head the baron scowled seeing the way feydrautha turned to him languidly controlling his rage with difficulty the baron waved his hand toward the young man standing in the arena beside the sprawled body of the slave give the boy a head he earned it by exposing the slavemaster feydrautha saw the signal of agreement thought they think they honor me let them see what i think he saw his handlers approaching with a sawknife to do the honors waved them back repeated the gesture as they hesitated they think they honor me with just a head he thought he bent and crossed the gladiators hands around the protruding knife handle then removed the knife and placed it in the limp hands it was done in an instant and he straightened beckoned his handlers bury this slave intact with his knife in his hands he said the man earned it in the golden box count fenring leaned close to the baron said a grand gesture thattrue bravura your nephew has style as well as courage he insults the crowd by refusing the head the baron muttered not at all lady fenring said she turned looking up at the tiers around them and the baron noted the line of her necka truly lovely flowing of muscleslike a young boys they like what your nephew did she said as the import of feydrauthas gesture penetrated to the most distant seats as the people saw the handlers carrying off the dead gladiator intact the baron watched them and realized she had interpreted the reaction correctly the people were going wild beating on each other screaming and stamping the baron spoke wearily i shall have to order a fete you can not send people home like this their energies unspent they must see that i share their elation he gave a hand signal to his guard and a servant above them dipped the harkonnen orange pennant over the boxonce twice three timessignal for a fete feydrautha crossed the arena to stand beneath the golden box his weapons sheathed arms hanging at his sides above the undiminished frenzy of the crowd he called a fete uncle the noise began to subside as people saw the conversation and waited in your honor feyd the baron called down and again he caused the pennant to be dipped in signal across the arena the prubarriers had been dropped and young men were leaping down into the arena racing toward feydrautha you ordered the prushields dropped baron the count asked no one will harm the lad the baron said hes a hero the first of the charging mass reached feydrautha lifted him on their shoulders began parading around the arena he could walk unarmed and unshielded through the poorest quarters of harko tonight the baron said theyd give him the last of their food and drink just for his company the baron pushed himself from his chair settled his weight into his suspensors you will forgive me please there are matters that require my immediate attention the guard will see you to the keep the count arose bowed certainly baron were looking forward to the fete ive ahhhmmmm never seen a harkonnen fete yes the baron said the fete he turned was enveloped by guards as he stepped into the private exit from the box a guard captain bowed to count fenring your orders my lord we will ahhh wait for the worst mmmm crush to ummm pass the count said yes mlord the man bowed himself back three paces count fenring faced his lady spoke again in their personal hummingcode tongue you saw it of course in the same humming tongue she said the lad knew the gladiator wouldnt be drugged there was a moment of fear yes but no surprise it was planned he said the entire performance without a doubt it stinks of hawat indeed she said i demanded earlier that the baron eliminate hawat that was an error my dear i see that now the harkonnens may have a new baron ere long if thats hawats plan that will bear examination true she said the young one will be more amenable to control for us after tonight she said you dont anticipate difficulty seducing him my little broodmother no my love you saw how he looked at me yes and i can see now why we must have that bloodline indeed and its obvious we must have a hold on him ill plant deep in his deepest self the necessary pranabindu phrases to bend him well leave as soon as possibleas soon as youre sure he said she shuddered by all means i should not want to bear a child in this terrible place the things we do in the name of humanity he said yours is the easy part she said there are some ancient prejudices i overcome he said theyre quite primordial you know my poor dear she said and patted his cheek you know this is the only way to be sure of saving that bloodline he spoke in a dry voice i quite understand what we do we wont fail she said guilt starts as a feeling of failure he reminded therell be no guilt she said hypnoligation of that feydrauthas psyche and his child in my wombthen we go that uncle he said have you ever seen such distortion hes pretty fierce she said but the nephew could well grow to be worse thanks to that uncle you know when you think what this lad couldve been with some other upbringingwith the atreides code to guide him for example its sad she said would that we couldve saved both the atreides youth and this one from what i heard of that young paula most admirable lad good union of breeding and training he shook his head but we shouldnt waste sorrow over the aristocracy of misfortune theres a bene gesserit saying she said you have sayings for everything he protested youll like this one she said it goes do not count a human dead until youve seen his body and even then you can make a mistake muaddib tells us in a time of reflection that his first collisions with arrakeen necessities were the true beginnings of his education he learned then how to pole the sand for its weather learned the language of the winds needles stinging his skin learned how the nose can buzz with sanditch and how to gather his bodys precious moisture around him to guard it and preserve it as his eyes assumed the blue of the ibad he learned the chakobsa way stilgars preface to muaddib the man by the princess irulan stilgars troop returning to the sietch with its two strays from the desert climbed out of the basin in the waning light of the first moon the robed figures hurried with the smell of home in their nostrils dawns gray line behind them was brightest at the notch in their horizoncalendar that marked the middle of autumn the month of caprock windraked dead leaves strewed the cliffbase where the sietch children had been gathering them but the sounds of the troops passage except for occasional blunderings by paul and his mother could not be distinguished from the natural sounds of the night paul wiped sweatcaked dust from his forehead felt a tug at his arm heard chanis voice hissing do as i told you bring the fold of your hood down over your forehead leave only the eyes exposed you waste moisture a whispered command behind them demanded silence the desert hears you a bird chirruped from the rocks high above them the troop stopped and paul sensed abrupt tension there came a faint thumping from the rocks a sound no louder than mice jumping in the sand again the bird chirruped a stir passed through the troops ranks and again the mousethumping pecked its way across the sand once more the bird chirruped the troop resumed its climb up into a crack in the rocks but there was a stillness of breath about the fremen now that filled paul with caution and he noted covert glances toward chani the way she seemed to withdraw pulling in upon herself there was rock underfoot now a faint gray swishing of robes around them and paul sensed a relaxing of discipline but still that quietoftheperson about chani and the others he followed a shadow shapeup steps a turn more steps into a tunnel past two moisturesealed doors and into a globelighted narrow passage with yellow rock walls and ceiling all around him paul saw the fremen throwing back their hoods removing nose plugs breathing deeply someone sighed paul looked for chani found that she had left his side he was hemmed in by a press of robed bodies someone jostled him said excuse me usul what a crush its always this way on his left the narrow bearded face of the one called farok turned toward paul the stained eyepits and blue darkness of eyes appeared even darker under the yellow globes throw off your hood usul farok said youre home and he helped paul releasing the hood catch elbowing a space around them paul slipped out his nose plugs swung the mouth baffle aside the odor of the place assailed him unwashed bodies distillate esters of reclaimed wastes everywhere the sour effluvia of humanity with over it all a turbulence of spice and spicelike harmonics why are we waiting farok paul asked for the reverend mother i think you heard the messagepoor chani poor chani paul asked himself he looked around wondering where she was where his mother had got to in all this crush farok took a deep breath the smells of home he said paul saw that the man was enjoying the stink of this air that there was no irony in his tone he heard his mother cough then and her voice came back to him through the press of the troop how rich the odors of your sietch stilgar i see you do much working with the spice you make paper plastics and isnt that chemical explosives you know this from what you smell it was another mans voice and paul realized she was speaking for his benefit that she wanted him to make a quick acceptance of this assault on his nostrils there came a buzz of activity at the head of the troop and a prolonged indrawn breath that seemed to pass through the fremen and paul heard hushed voices back down the line its true thenliet is dead liet paul thought then chani daughter of liet the pieces fell together in his mind liet was the fremen name of the planetologist paul looked at farok asked is it the liet known as kynes there is only one liet farok said paul turned stared at the robed back of a fremen in front of him then lietkynes is dead he thought it was harkonnen treachery someone hissed they made it seem an accident lost in the desert a thopter crash paul felt a burst of anger the man who had befriended them helped save them from the harkonnen hunters the man who had sent his fremen cohorts searching for two strays in the desert another victim of the harkonnens does usul hunger yet for revenge farok asked before paul could answer there came a low call and the troop swept forward into a wider chamber carrying paul with them he found himself in an open space confronted by stilgar and a strange woman wearing a flowing wraparound garment of brilliant orange and green her arms were bare to the shoulders and he could see she wore no stillsuit her skin was a pale olive dark hair swept back from her high forehead throwing emphasis on sharp cheekbones and aquiline nose between the dense darkness of her eyes she turned toward him and paul saw golden rings threaded with water tallies dangling from her ears this bested my jamis she demanded be silent harah stilgar said it was jamis doinghe invoked the tahaddi alburhan hes not but a boy she said she gave her head a sharp shake from side to side setting the water tallies to jingling my children made fatherless by another child surely twas an accident usul how many years have you stilgar asked fifteen standard paul said stilgar swept his eyes over the troop is there one among you cares to challenge me silence stilgar looked at the woman until ive learned his weirding ways id not challenge him she returned his stare but you saw the stranger woman who went with chani to the reverend mother stilgar asked shes an outfreyn sayyadina mother to this lad the mother and son are masters of the weirding ways of battle lisan algaib the woman whispered her eyes held awe as she turned them back toward paul the legend again paul thought perhaps stilgar said it hasnt been tested though he returned his attention to paul usul its our way that youve now the responsibility for jamis woman here and for his two sons his yali his quarters are yours his coffee service is yours and this his woman paul studied the woman wondering why isnt she mourning her man why does she show no hate for me abruptly he saw that the fremen were staring at him waiting someone whispered theres work to do say how you accept her stilgar said do you accept harah as woman or servant harah lifted her arms turning slowly on one heel i am still young usul its said i still look as young as when i was with geoff before jamis bested him jamis killed another to win her paul thought paul said if i accept her as servant may i yet change my mind at a later time youd have a year to change your decision stilgar said after that shes a free woman to choose as she wishes or you could free her to choose for herself at any time but shes your responsibility no matter what for one year and youll always share some responsibility for the sons of jamis i accept her as servant paul said harah stamped a foot shook her shoulders with anger but im young stilgar looked at paul said cautions a worthy trait in a man whod lead but im young harah repeated be silent stilgar commanded if a thing has merit itll be show usul to his quarters and see he has fresh clothing and a place to rest ohhhh she said paul had registered enough of her to have a first approximation he felt the impatience of the troop knew many things were being delayed here he wondered if he dared ask the whereabouts of his mother and chani saw from stilgars nervous stance that it would be a mistake he faced harah pitched his voice with tone and tremolo to accent her fear and awe said show me my quarters harah we will discuss your youth another time she backed away two steps cast a frightened glance at stilgar he has the weirding voice she husked stilgar paul said chanis father put heavy obligation on me if theres anything itll be decided in council stilgar said you can speak then he nodded in dismissal turned away with the rest of the troop following him paul took harahs arm noting how cool her flesh seemed feeling her tremble ill not harm you harah he said show me our quarters and he smoothed his voice with relaxants youll not cast me out when the years gone she said i know for true im not as young as once i was as long as i live youll have a place with me he said he released her arm come now where are our quarters she turned led the way down the passage turning right into a wide cross tunnel lighted by evenly spaced yellow overhead globes the stone floor was smooth swept clean of sand paul moved up beside her studied the aquiline profile as they walked you do not hate me harah why should i hate you she nodded to a cluster of children who stared at them from the raised ledge of a side passage paul glimpsed adult shapes behind the children partly hidden by filmy hangings i bested jamis stilgar said the ceremony was held and youre a friend of jamis she glanced sidelong at him stilgar said you gave moisture to the dead is that truth yes its more than ill do can do dont you mourn him in the time of mourning ill mourn him they passed an arched opening paul looked through it at men and women working with standmounted machinery in a large bright chamber there seemed an extra tempo of urgency to them whatre they doing in there paul asked she glanced back as they passed beyond the arch said they hurry to finish the quota in the plastics shop before we flee we need many dew collectors for the planting flee until the butchers stop hunting us or are driven from our land paul caught himself in a stumble sensing an arrested instant of time remembering a fragment a visual projection of presciencebut it was displaced like a montage in motion the bits of his prescient memory were not quite as he remembered them the sardaukar hunt us he said theyll not find much excepting an empty sietch or two she said and theyll find their share of death in the sand theyll find this place he asked likely yet we take the time to he motioned with his head toward the arch now far behind them make dew collectors the planting goes on whatre dew collectors he asked the glance she turned on him was full of surprise dont they teach you anything in the wherever it is you come from not about dew collectors hai she said and there was a whole conversation in the one word well what are they each bush each weed you see out there in the erg she said how do you suppose it lives when we leave it each is planted most tenderly in its own little pit the pits are filled with smooth ovals of chromoplastic light turns them white you can see them glistening in the dawn if you look down from a high place white reflects but when old father sun departs the chromoplastic reverts to transparency in the dark it cools with extreme rapidity the surface condenses moisture out of the air that moisture trickles down to keep our plants alive dew collectors he muttered enchanted by the simple beauty of such a scheme ill mourn jamis in the proper time for it she said as though her mind had not left his other question he was a good man jamis but quick to anger a good provider jamis and a wonder with the children he made no separation between geoffs boy my firstborn and his own true son they were equal in his eyes she turned a questing stare on paul would it be that way with you usul we dont have that problem but if harah she recoiled at the harsh edge in his voice they passed another brightly lighted room visible through an arch on their left whats made there he asked they repair the weaving machinery she said but it must be dismantled by tonight she gestured at a tunnel branching to their left through there and beyond thats food processing and stillsuit maintenance she looked at paul your suit looks new but if it needs work im good with suits i work in the factory in season they began coming on knots of people now and thicker clusterings of openings in the tunnels sides a file of men and women passed them carrying packs that gurgled heavily the smell of spice strong about them theyll not get our water harah said or our spice you can be sure of that paul glanced at the openings in the tunnel walls seeing the heavy carpets on the raised ledge glimpses of rooms with bright fabrics on the walls piled cushions people in the openings fell silent at their approach followed paul with untamed stares the people find it strange you bested jamis harah said likely youll have some proving to do when were settled in a new sietch i dont like killing he said thus stilgar tells it she said but her voice betrayed her disbelief a shrill chanting grew louder ahead of them they came to another side opening wider than any of the others paul had seen he slowed his pace staring in at a room crowded with children sitting crosslegged on a marooncarpeted floor at a chalkboard against the far wall stood a woman in a yellow wraparound a projectostylus in one hand the board was filled with designscircles wedges and curves snake tracks and squares flowing arcs split by parallel lines the woman pointed to the designs one after the other as fast as she could move the stylus and the children chanted in rhythm with her moving hand paul listened hearing the voices grow dimmer behind as he moved deeper into the sietch with harah tree the children chanted tree grass dune wind mountain hill fire lightning rock rocks dust sand heat shelter heat full winter cold empty erosion summer cavern day tension moon night caprock sandtide slope planting binder you conduct classes at a time like this paul asked her face went somber and grief edged her voice what liet taught us we can not pause an instant in that liet who is dead must not be forgotten its the chakobsa way she crossed the tunnel to the left stepped up onto a ledge parted gauzy orange hangings and stood aside your yali is ready for you usul paul hesitated before joining her on the ledge he felt a sudden reluctance to be alone with this woman it came to him that he was surrounded by a way of life that could only be understood by postulating an ecology of ideas and values he felt that this fremen world was fishing for him trying to snare him in its ways and he knew what lay in that snarethe wild jihad the religious war he felt he should avoid at any cost this is your yali harah said why do you hesitate paul nodded joined her on the ledge he lifted the hangings across from her feeling metal fibers in the fabric followed her into a short entrance way and then into a larger room square about six meters to a sidethick blue carpets on the floor blue and green fabrics hiding the rock walls glowglobes tuned to yellow overhead bobbing against draped yellow ceiling fabrics the effect was that of an ancient tent harah stood in front of him left hand on hip her eyes studying his face the children are with a friend she said they will present themselves later paul masked his unease beneath a quick scanning of the room thin hangings to the right he saw partly concealed a larger room with cushions piled around the walls he felt a soft breeze from an air duct saw the outlet cunningly hidden in a pattern of hangings directly ahead of him do you wish me to help you remove your stillsuit harah asked no thank you shall i bring food yes there is a reclamation chamber off the other room she gestured for your comfort and convenience when youre out of your stillsuit you said we have to leave this sietch paul said shouldnt we be packing or something it will be done in its time she said the butchers have yet to penetrate to our region still she hesitated staring at him what is it he demanded youve not the eyes of the ibad she said its strange but not entirely unattractive get the food he said im hungry she smiled at hima knowing womans smile that he found disquieting i am your servant she said and whirled away in one lithe motion ducking behind a heavy wall hanging that revealed another passage before falling back into place feeling angry with himself paul brushed through the thin hanging on the right and into the larger room he stood there a moment caught by uncertainty and he wondered where chani was chani who had just lost her father were alike in that he thought a wailing cry sounded from the outer corridors its volume muffled by the intervening hangings it was repeated a bit more distant and again paul realized someone was calling the time he focused on the fact that he had seen no clocks the faint smell of burning creosote bush came to his nostrils riding on the omnipresent stink of the sietch paul saw that he had already suppressed the odorous assault on his senses and he wondered again about his mother how the moving montage of the future would incorporate her and the daughter she bore mutable timeawareness danced around him he shook his head sharply focusing his attention on the evidences that spoke of profound depth and breadth in this fremen culture that had swallowed them with its subtle oddities he had seen a thing about the caverns and this room a thing that suggested far greater differences than anything he had yet encountered there was no sign of a poison snooper here no indication of their use anywhere in the cave warren yet he could smell poisons in the sietch stenchstrong ones common ones he heard a rustle of hangings thought it was harah returning with food and turned to watch her instead from beneath a displaced pattern of hangings he saw two young boysperhaps aged nine and tenstaring out at him with greedy eyes each wore a small kindjaltype of crysknife rested a hand on the hilt and paul recalled the stories of the frementhat their children fought as ferociously as the adults the hands move the lips move ideas gush from his words and his eyes devour he is an island of selfdom description from a manual of muaddib by the princess irulan phosphortubes in the faraway upper reaches of the cavern cast a dim light onto the thronged interior hinting at the great size of this rockenclosed space larger jessica saw than even the gathering hall of her bene gesserit school she estimated there were more than five thousand people gathered out there beneath the ledge where she stood with stilgar and more were coming the air was murmurous with people your son has been summoned from his rest sayyadina stilgar said do you wish him to share in your decision could he change my decision certainly the air with which you speak comes from your own lungs but the decision stands she said but she felt misgivings wondering if she should use paul as an excuse for backing out of a dangerous course there was an unborn daughter to think of as well what endangered the flesh of the mother endangered the flesh of the daughter men came with rolled carpets grunting under the weight of them stirring up dust as the loads were dropped onto the ledge stilgar took her arm led her back into the acoustical horn that formed the rear limits of the ledge he indicated a rock bench within the horn the reverend mother will sit here but you may rest yourself until she comes i prefer to stand jessica said she watched the men unroll the carpets covering the ledge looked out at the crowd there were at least ten thousand people on the rock floor now and still they came out on the desert she knew it already was red nightfall but here in the cavern hall was perpetual twilight a gray vastness thronged with people come to see her risk her life a way was opened through the crowd to her right and she saw paul approaching flanked by two small boys there was a swaggering air of selfimportance about the children they kept hands on knives scowled at the wall of people on either side the sons of jamis who are now the sons of usul stilgar said they take their escort duties seriously he ventured a smile at jessica jessica recognized the effort to lighten her mood and was grateful for it but could not take her mind from the danger that confronted her i had no choice but to do this she thought we must move swiftly if were to secure our place among these fremen paul climbed to the ledge leaving the children below he stopped in front of his mother glanced at stilgar back to jessica what is happening i thought i was being summoned to council stilgar raised a hand for silence gestured to his left where another way had been opened in the throng chani came down the lane opened there her elfin face set in lines of grief she had removed her stillsuit and wore a graceful blue wraparound that exposed her thin arms near the shoulder on her left arm a green kerchief had been tied green for mourning paul thought it was one of the customs the two sons of jamis had explained to him by indirection telling him they wore no green because they accepted him as guardianfather are you the lisan algaib they had asked and paul had sensed the jihad in their words shrugged off the question with one of his ownlearning then that kaleff the elder of the two was ten and the natural son of geoff orlop the younger was eight the natural son of jamis it had been a strange day with these two standing guard over him because he asked it keeping away the curious allowing him the time to nurse his thoughts and prescient memories to plan a way to prevent the jihad now standing beside his mother on the cavern ledge and looking out at the throng he wondered if any plan could prevent the wild outpouring of fanatic legions chani nearing the ledge was followed at a distance by four women carrying another woman in a litter jessica ignored chanis approach focusing all her attention on the woman in the littera crone a wrinkled and shriveled ancient thing in a black gown with hood thrown back to reveal the tight knot of gray hair and the stringy neck the littercarriers deposited their burden gently on the ledge from below and chani helped the old woman to her feet so this is their reverend mother jessica thought the old woman leaned heavily on chani as she hobbled toward jessica looking like a collection of sticks draped in the black robe she stopped in front of jessica peered upward for a long moment before speaking in a husky whisper so youre the one the old head nodded once precariously on the thin neck the shadout mapes was right to pity you jessica spoke quickly scornfully i need no ones pity that remains to be seen husked the old woman she turned with surprising quickness and faced the throng tell them stilgar must i he asked we are the people of misr the old woman rasped since our sunni ancestors fled from nilotic alourouba we have known flight and death the young go on that our people shall not die stilgar took a deep breath stepped forward two paces jessica felt the hush come over the crowded cavernsome twenty thousand people now standing silently almost without movement it made her feel suddenly small and filled with caution tonight we must leave this sietch that has sheltered us for so long and go south into the desert stilgar said his voice boomed out across the uplifted faces reverberating with the force given it by the acoustical horn behind the ledge still the throng remained silent the reverend mother tells me she can not survive another hajra stilgar said we have lived before without a reverend mother but it is not good for people to seek a new home in such straits now the throng stirred rippling with whispers and currents of disquiet that this may not come to pass stilgar said our new sayyadina jessica of the weirding has consented to enter the rite at this time she will attempt to pass within that we not lose the strength of our reverend mother jessica of the weirding jessica thought she saw paul staring at her his eyes filled with questions but his mouth held silent by all the strangeness around them if i die in the attempt what will become of him jessica asked herself again she felt the misgivings fill her mind chani led the old reverend mother to a rock bench deep in the acoustical horn returned to stand beside stilgar that we may not lose all if jessica of the weirding should fail stilgar said chani daughter of liet will be consecrated in the sayyadina at this time he stepped one pace to the side from deep in the acoustical horn the old womans voice came out to them an amplified whisper harsh and penetrating chani has returned from her hajrachani has seen the waters a sussurant response arose from the crowd she has seen the waters i consecrate the daughter of liet in the sayyadina husked the old woman she is accepted the crowd responded paul barely heard the ceremony his attention still centered on what had been said of his mother if she should fail he turned and looked back at the one they called reverend mother studying the dried crone features the fathomless blue fixation of her eyes she looked as though a breeze would blow her away yet there was that about her which suggested she might stand untouched in the path of a coriolis storm she carried the same aura of power that he remembered from the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam who had tested him with agony in the way of the gom jabbar i the reverend mother ramallo whose voice speaks as a multitude say this to you the old woman said it is fitting that chani enter the sayyadina it is fitting the crowd responded the old woman nodded whispered i give her the silver skies the golden desert and its shining rocks the green fields that will be i give these to sayyadina chani and lest she forget that shes servant of us all to her fall the menial tasks in this ceremony of the seed let it be as shaihulud will have it she lifted a brownstick arm dropped it jessica feeling the ceremony close around her with a current that swept her beyond all turning back glanced once at pauls question filled face then prepared herself for the ordeal let the watermasters come forward chani said with only the slightest quaver of uncertainty in her girlchild voice now jessica felt herself at the focus of danger knowing its presence in the watchfulness of the throng in the silence a band of men made its way through a serpentine path opened in the crowd moving up from the back in pairs each pair carried a small skin sack perhaps twice the size of a human head the sacks sloshed heavily the two leaders deposited their load at chanis feet on the ledge and stepped back jessica looked at the sack then at the men they had their hoods thrown back exposing long hair tied in a roll at the base of the neck the black pits of their eyes stared back at her without wavering a furry redolence of cinnamon arose from the sack wafted across jessica the spice she wondered is there water chani asked the watermaster on the left a man with a purple scar line across the bridge of his nose nodded once there is water sayyadina he said but we can not drink of it is there seed chani asked there is seed the man said chani knelt and put her hands to the sloshing sack blessed is the water and its seed there was familiarity to the rite and jessica looked back at the reverend mother ramallo the old womans eyes were closed and she sat hunched over as though asleep sayyadina jessica chani said jessica turned to see the girl staring up at her have you tasted the blessed water chani asked before jessica could answer chani said it is not possible that you have tasted the blessed water you are outworlder and unprivileged a sigh passed through the crowd a sussuration of robes that made the nape hairs creep on jessicas neck the crop was large and the maker has been destroyed chani said she began unfastening a coiled spout fixed to the top of the sloshing sack now jessica felt the sense of danger boiling around her she glanced at paul saw that he was caught up in the mystery of the ritual and had eyes only for chani has he seen this moment in time jessica wondered she rested a hand on her abdomen thinking of the unborn daughter there asking herself do i have the right to risk us both chani lifted the spout toward jessica said here is the water of life the water that is greater than waterkan the water that frees the soul if you be a reverend mother it opens the universe to you let shaihulud judge now jessica felt herself torn between duty to her unborn child and duty to paul for paul she knew she should take that spout and drink of the sacks contents but as she bent to the proffered spout her senses told her its peril the stuff in the sack had a bitter smell subtly akin to many poisons that she knew but unlike them too you must drink it now chani said theres no turning back jessica reminded herself but nothing in all her bene gesserit training came into her mind to help her through this instant what is it jessica asked herself liquor a drug she bent over the spout smelled the esters of cinnamon remembering then the drunkenness of duncan idaho spice liquor she asked herself she took the siphon tube in her mouth pulled up only the most minuscule sip it tasted of the spice a faint bite acrid on the tongue chani pressed down on the skin bag a great gulp of the stuff surged into jessicas mouth and before she could help herself she swallowed it fighting to retain her calmness and dignity to accept a little death is worse than death itself chani said she stared at jessica waiting and jessica stared back still holding the spout in her mouth she tasted the sacks contents in her nostrils in the roof of her mouth in her cheeks in her eyesa biting sweetness now cool again chani sent the liquid gushing into jessicas mouth delicate jessica studied chanis faceelfin featuresseeing the traces of lietkynes there as yet unfixed by time this is a drug they feed me jessica told herself but it was unlike any other drug of her experience and bene gesserit training included the taste of many drugs chanis features were so clear as though outlined in light a drug whirling silence settled around jessica every fiber of her body accepted the fact that something profound had happened to it she felt that she was a conscious mote smaller than any subatomic particle yet capable of motion and of sensing her surroundings like an abrupt revelationthe curtains whipped awayshe realized she had become aware of a psychokinesthetic extension of herself she was the mote yet not the mote the cavern remained around herthe people she sensed them paul chani stilgar the reverend mother ramallo reverend mother at the school there had been rumors that some did not survive the reverend mother ordeal that the drug took them jessica focused her attention on the reverend mother ramallo aware now that all this was happening in a frozen instant of timesuspended time for her alone why is time suspended she asked herself she stared at the frozen expressions around her seeing a dust mote above chanis head stopped there waiting the answer to this instant came like an explosion in her consciousness her personal time was suspended to save her life she focused on the psychokinesthetic extension of herself looking within and was confronted immediately with a cellular core a pit of blackness from which she recoiled that is the place where we can not look she thought there is the place the reverend mothers are so reluctant to mentionthe place where only a kwisatz haderach may look this realization returned a small measure of confidence and again she ventured to focus on the psychokinesthetic extension becoming a moteself that searched within her for danger she found it within the drug she had swallowed the stuff was dancing particles within her its motions so rapid that even frozen time could not stop them dancing particles she began recognizing familiar structures atomic linkages a carbon atom here helical wavering a glucose molecule an entire chain of molecules confronted her and she recognized a protein a methylprotein configuration ahhh it was a soundless mental sigh within her as she saw the nature of the poison with her psychokinesthetic probing she moved into it shifted an oxygen mote allowed another carbon mote to link reattached a linkage of oxygen hydrogen the change spread faster and faster as the catalyzed reaction opened its surface of contact the suspension of time relaxed its hold upon her and she sensed motion the tube spout from the sack was touched to her mouthgently collecting a drop of moisture chanis taking the catalyst from my body to change the poison in that sack jessica thought why someone eased her to a sitting position she saw the old reverend mother ramallo being brought to sit beside her on the carpeted ledge a dry hand touched her neck and there was another psychokinesthetic mote within her awareness jessica tried to reject it but the mote swept closer closer they touched it was like an ultimate simpatico being two people at once not telepathy but mutual awareness with the old reverend mother but jessica saw that the reverend mother didnt think of herself as old an image unfolded before the mutual minds eye a young girl with a dancing spirit and tender humor within the mutual awareness the young girl said yes that is how i am jessica could only accept the words not respond to them youll have it all soon jessica the inward image said this is hallucination jessica told herself you know better than that the inward image said swiftly now do not fight me there isnt much time we there came a long pause then you shouldve told us you were pregnant jessica found the voice that talked within the mutual awareness why this changes both of you holy mother what have we done jessica sensed a forced shift in the mutual awareness saw another motepresence with the inward eye the other mote darted wildly here there circling it radiated pure terror youll have to be strong the old reverend mothers imagepresence said be thankful its a daughter you carry this wouldve killed a male fetus now carefully gently touch your daughterpresence be your daughterpresence absorb the fear soothe use your courage and your strength gently now gently the other whirling mote swept near and jessica compelled herself to touch it terror threatened to overwhelm her she fought it the only way she knew i shall not fear fear is the mind killer the litany brought a semblance of calm the other mote lay quiescent against her words wont work jessica told herself she reduced herself to basic emotional reactions radiated love comfort a warm snuggling of protection the terror receded again the presence of the old reverend mother asserted itself but now there was a tripling of mutual awarenesstwo active and one that lay quietly absorbing time compels me the reverend mother said within the awareness i have much to give you and i do not know if your daughter can accept all this while remaining sane but it must be the needs of the tribe are paramount what remain silent and accept experiences began to unroll before jessica it was like a lecture strip in a subliminal training projector at the bene gesserit school but faster blindingly faster yet distinct she knew each experience as it happened there was a lovervirile bearded with the fremen eyes and jessica saw his strength and tenderness all of him in one blinkmoment through the reverend mothers memory there was no time now to think of what this might be doing to the daughter fetus only time to accept and record the experiences poured in on jessicabirth life deathimportant matters and unimportant an outpouring of singleview time why should a fall of sand from a clifftop stick in the memory she asked herself too late jessica saw what was happening the old woman was dying and in dying pouring her experiences into jessicas awareness as water is poured into a cup the other mote faded back into prebirth awareness as jessica watched it and dyinginconception the old reverend mother left her life in jessicas memory with one last sighing blur of words ive been a long time waiting for you she said here is my life there it was encapsuled all of it even the moment of death i am now a reverend mother jessica realized and she knew with a generalized awareness that she had become in truth precisely what was meant by a bene gesserit reverend mother the poison drug had transformed her this wasnt exactly how they did it at the bene gesserit school she knew no one had ever introduced her to the mysteries of it but she knew the end result was the same jessica sensed the daughtermote still touching her inner awareness probed it without response a terrible sense of loneliness crept through jessica in the realization of what had happened to her she saw her own life as a pattern that had slowed and all life around her speeded up so that the dancing interplay became clearer the sensation of moteawareness faded slightly its intensity easing as her body relaxed from the threat of the poison but still she felt that other mote touching it with a sense of guilt at what she had allowed to happen to it i did it my poor unformed dear little daughter i brought you into this universe and exposed your awareness to all its varieties without any defenses a tiny outflowing of lovecomfort like a reflection of what she had poured into it came from the other mote before jessica could respond she felt the adab presence of demanding memory there was something that needed doing she groped for it realizing she was being impeded by a muzziness of the changed drug permeating her senses i could change that she thought i could take away the drug action and make it harmless but she sensed this would be an error im within a rite of joining then she knew what she had to do jessica opened her eyes gestured to the watersack now being held above her by chani it has been blessed jessica said mingle the waters let the change come to all that the people may partake and share in the blessing let the catalyst do its work she thought let the people drink of it and have their awareness of each other heightened for awhile the drug is safe now now that a reverend mother has changed it still the demanding memory worked on her thrusting there was another thing she had to do she realized but the drug made it difficult to focus ahhhhh the old reverend mother i have met the reverend mother ramallo jessica said she is gone but she remains let her memory be honored in the rite now where did i get those words jessica wondered and she realized they came from another memory the life that had been given to her and now was part of herself something about that gift felt incomplete though let them have their orgy the othermemory said within her theyve little enough pleasure out of living yes and you and i need this little time to become acquainted before i recede and pour out through your memories already i feel myself being tied to bits of you ahhh youve a mind filled with interesting things so many things id never imagined and the memorymind encapsulated within her opened itself to jessica permitting a view down a wide corridor to other reverend mothers until there seemed no end to them jessica recoiled fearing she would become lost in an ocean of oneness still the corridor remained revealing to jessica that the fremen culture was far older than she had suspected there had been fremen on poritrin she saw a people grown soft with an easy planet fair game for imperial raiders to harvest and plant human colonies on bela tegeuse and salusa secundus oh the wailing jessica sensed in that parting far down the corridor an imagevoice screamed they denied us the hajj jessica saw the slave cribs on bela tegeuse down that inner corridor saw the weeding out and the selecting that spread men to rossak and harmonthep scenes of brutal ferocity opened to her like the petals of a terrible flower and she saw the thread of the past carried by sayyadina after sayyadinafirst by word of mouth hidden in the sand chanteys then refined through their own reverend mothers with the discovery of the poison drug on rossak and now developed to subtle strengthen arrakis in the discovery of the water of life far down the inner corridor another voice screamed never to forgive never to forget but jessicas attention was focused on the revelation of the water of life seeing its source the liquid exhalation of a dying sandworm a maker and as she saw the killing of it in her new memory she suppressed a gasp the creature was drowned mother are you all right pauls voice intruded on her and jessica struggled out of the inner awareness to stare up at him conscious of duty to him but resenting his presence im like a person whose hands were kept numb without sensation from the first moment of awarenessuntil one day the ability to feel is forced into them the thought hung in her mind an enclosing awareness and i say look i have no hands but the people all around me say what are hands are you all right paul repeated yes is this all right for me to drink he gestured to the sack in chanis hands they want me to drink it she heard the hidden meaning in his words realized he had detected the poison in the original unchanged substance that he was concerned for her it occurred to jessica then to wonder about the limits of pauls prescience his question revealed much to her you may drink it she said it has been changed and she looked beyond him to see stilgar staring down at her the darkdark eyes studying now we know you can not be false he said she sensed hidden meaning here too but the muzziness of the drug was overpowering her senses how warm it was and soothing how beneficent these fremen to bring her into the fold of such companionship paul saw the drug take hold of his mother he searched his memorythe fixed past the fluxlines of the possible futures it was like scanning through arrested instants of time disconcerting to the lens of the inner eye the fragments were difficult to understand when snatched out of the flux this drughe could assemble knowledge about it understand what it was doing to his mother but the knowledge lacked a natural rhythm lacked a system of mutual reflection he realized suddenly that it was one thing to see the past occupying the present but the true test of prescience was to see the past in the future things persisted in not being what they seemed drink it chani said she waved the hornspout of a watersack under his nose paul straightened staring at chani he felt carnival excitement in the air he knew what would happen if he drank this spice drug with its quintessence of the substance that brought the change onto him he would return to the vision of pure time of timebecomespace it would perch him on the dizzying summit and defy him to understand from behind chani stilgar said drink it lad you delay the rite paul listened to the crowd then hearing the wildness in their voiceslisan algaib they said muaddib he looked down at his mother she appeared peacefully asleep in a sitting positionher breathing even and deep a phrase out of the future that was his lonely past came into his mind she sleeps in the waters of life chani tugged at his sleeve paul took the hornspout into his mouth hearing the people shout he felt the liquid gush into his throat as chani pressed the sack sensed giddiness in the fumes chani removed the spout handed the sack into hands that reached for it from the floor of the cavern his eyes focused on her arm the green band of mourning there as she straightened chani saw the direction of his gaze said i can mourn him even in the happiness of the waters this was something he gave us she put her hand into his pulling him along the ledge we are alike in a thing usul we have each lost a father to the harkonnens paul followed her he felt that his head had been separated from his body and restored with odd connections his legs were remote and rubbery they entered a narrow side passage its walls dimly lighted by spacedout glowglobes paul felt the drug beginning to have its unique effect on him opening time like a flower he found need to steady himself against chani as they turned through another shadowed tunnel the mixture of whipcord and softness he felt beneath her robe stirred his blood the sensation mingled with the work of the drug folding future and past into the present leaving him the thinnest margin of trinocular focus i know you chani he whispered weve sat upon a ledge above the sand while i soothed your fears weve caressed in the dark of the sietch weve he found himself losing focus tried to shake his head stumbled chani steadied him led him through thick hangings into the yellow warmth of a private apartmenttow tables cushions a sleeping pad beneath an orange spread paul grew aware that they had stopped that chani stood facing him and that her eyes betrayed a look of quiet terror you must tell me she whispered you are sihaya he said the desert spring when the tribe shares the water she said were togetherall of us we share i can sense the others with me but im afraid to share with you why he tried to focus on her but past and future were merging into the present blurring her image he saw her in countless ways and positions and settings theres something frightening in you she said when i took you away from the others i did it because i could feel what the others wanted you press on people you make us see things he forced himself to speak distinctly what do you see she looked down at her hands i see a child in my arms its our child yours and mine she put a hand to her mouth how can i know every feature of you theyve a little of the talent his mind told him but they suppress it because it terrifies in a moment of clarity he saw how chani was trembling what is it you want to say he asked usul she whispered and still she trembled you can not back into the future he said a profound compassion for her swept through him he pulled her against him stroked her head chani chani dont fear usul help me she cried as she spoke he felt the drug complete its work within him ripping away the curtains to let him see the distant gray turmoil of his future youre so quiet chani said he held himself poised in the awareness seeing time stretch out in its weird dimension delicately balanced yet whirling narrow yet spread like a net gathering countless worlds and forces a tightwire that he must walk yet a teetertotter on which he balanced on one side he could see the imperium a harkonnen called feydrautha who flashed toward him like a deadly blade the sardaukar raging off their planet to spread pogrom on arrakis the guild conniving and plotting the bene gesserit with their scheme of selective breeding they lay massed like a thunderhead on his horizon held back by no more than the fremen and their muaddib the sleeping giant fremen poised for their wild crusade across the universe paul felt himself at the center at the pivot where the whole structure turned walking a thin wire of peace with a measure of happiness chani at his side he could see it stretching ahead of him a time of relative quiet in a hidden sietch a moment of peace between periods of violence theres no other place for peace he said usul youre crying chani murmured usul my strength do you give moisture to the dead to whose dead to ones not yet dead he said then let them have their time of life she said he sensed through the drug fog how right she was pulled her against him with savage pressure sihaya he said she put a palm against his cheek im no longer afraid usul look at me i see what you see when you hold me thus what do you see he demanded i see us giving love to each other in a time of quiet between storms its what we were meant to do the drug had him again and he thought so many times youve given me comfort and forgetfulness he felt anew the hyperillumination with its highrelief imagery of time sensed his future becoming memoriesthe tender indignities of physical love the sharing and communion of selves the softness and the violence youre the strong one chani he muttered stay with me always she said and kissed his cheek book three the prophet no woman no man no child ever was deeply intimate with my father the closest anyone ever came to casual camaraderie with the padishah emperor was the relationship offered by count hasimir fenring a companion from childhood the measure of count fenrings friendship may be seen first in a positive thing he allayed the landsraads suspicions after the arrakis affair it cost more than a billion solaris in spice bribes so my mother said and there were other gifts as well slave women royal honors and tokens of rank the second major evidence of the counts friendship was negative he refused to kill a man even though it was within his capabilities and my father commanded it i will relate this presently count fenring a profile by the princess irulan the baron vladimir harkonnen raged down the corridor from his private apartments flitting through patches of late afternoon sunlight that poured down from high windows he bobbed and twisted in his suspensors with violent movements past the private kitchen he stormed past the library past the small reception room and into the servants antechamber where the evening relaxation already had set in the guard captain iakin nefud squatted on a divan across the chamber the stupor of semuta dullness in his flat face the eerie wailing of semuta music around him his own court sat near to do his bidding nefud the baron roared men scrambled nefud stood his face composed by the narcotic but with an overlay of paleness that told of his fear the semuta music had stopped my lord baron nefud said only the drug kept the trembling out of his voice the baron scanned the faces around him seeing the looks of frantic quiet in them he returned his attention to nefud and spoke in a silken tone how long have you been my guard captain nefud nefud swallowed since arrakis my lord almost two years and have you always anticipated dangers to my person such has been my only desire my lord then where is feydrautha the baron roared nefud recoiled mlord you do not consider feydrautha a danger to my person again the voice was silken nefud wet his lips with his tongue some of the semuta dullness left his eyes feydrauthas in the slave quarters my lord with the women again eh the baron trembled with the effort of suppressing anger sire it could be hes silence the baron advanced another step into the antechamber noting how the men moved back clearing a subtle space around nefud dissociating themselves from the object of wrath did i not command you to know precisely where the nabaron was at all times the baron asked he moved a step closer did i not say to you that you were to know precisely what the nabaron was saying at all times and to whom another step did i not say to you that you were to tell me whenever he went into the quarters of the slave women nefud swallowed perspiration stood out on his forehead the baron held his voice flat almost devoid of emphasis did i not say these things to you nefud nodded and did i not say to that you were to check all slave boys sent to me and that you were to do this yourself personally again nefud nodded did you perchance not see the blemish on the thigh of the one sent me this evening the baron asked is it possible you uncle the baron whirled stared at feydrautha standing in the doorway the presence of his nephew here now the look of hurry that the young man could not quite conceal all revealed much feydrautha had his own spy system focused on the baron there is a body in my chambers that i wish removed the baron said and he kept his hand at the projectile weapon beneath his robes thankful that his shield was the best feydrautha glanced at two guardsmen against the right wall nodded the two detached themselves scurried out the door and down the hall toward the barons apartments those two eh the baron thought ah this young monster has much to learn yet about conspiracy i presume you left matters peaceful in the slave quarters feyd the baron said ive been playing cheops with the slavemaster feydrautha said and he thought what has gone wrong the boy we sent to my uncle has obviously been killed but he was perfect for the job even hawat couldnt have made a better choice the boy was perfect playing pyramid chess the baron said how nice did you win i ah yes uncle and feydrautha strove to contain his disquiet the baron snapped his fingers nefud you wish to be restored to my good graces sire what have i done nefud quavered thats unimportant now the baron said feyd has beaten the slavemaster at cheops did you hear that yes sire i wish you to take three men and go to the slavemaster the baron said garrote the slavemaster bring his body to me when youve finished that i may see it was done properly we can not have such inept chess players in our employ feydrautha went pale took a step forward but uncle i later feyd the baron said and waved a hand later the two guards who had gone to the barons quarters for the slave boys body staggered past the antechamber door with their load sagging between them arms trailing the baron watched until they were out of sight nefud stepped up beside the baron you wish me to kill the slavemaster now my lord now the baron said and when youve finished add those two who just passed to your list i dont like the way they carried that body one should do such things neatly ill wish to see their carcasses too nefud said my lord is it anything that ive do as your master has ordered feydrautha said and he thought all i can hope for now is to save my own skin good the baron thought he yet knows how to cut his losses and the baron smiled inwardly at himself thinking the lad knows too what will please me and be most apt to stay my wrath from falling on him he knows i must preserve him who else do i have who could take the reins i must leave someday i have no other as capable but he must learn and i must preserve myself while hes learning nefud signaled men to assist him led them out the door would you accompany me to my chambers feyd the baron asked i am yours to command feydrautha said he bowed thinking im caught after you the baron said and he gestured to the door feydrautha indicated his fear by only the barest hesitation have i failed utterly he asked himself will he slip a poisoned blade into my back slowly through the shield does he have an alternative successor let him experience this moment of terror the baron thought as he walked along behind his nephew he will succeed me but at a time of my choosing ill not have him throwing away what ive built feydrautha tried not to walk too swiftly he felt the skin crawling on his back as though his body itself wondered when the blow could come his muscles alternately tensed and relaxed have you heard the latest word from arrakis the baron asked no uncle feydrautha forced himself not to look back he turned down the hall out of the servants wing theyve a new prophet or religious leader of some kind among the fremen the baron said they call him muaddib very funny really it means the mouse ive told rabban to let them have their religion itll keep them occupied thats very interesting uncle feydrautha said he turned into the private corridor to his uncles quarters wondering why does he talk about religion is it some subtle hint to me yes isnt it the baron said they came into the barons apartments through the reception salon to the bedchamber subtle signs of a struggle greeted them here a suspensor lamp displaced a bedcushion on the floor a sootherreel spilled open across a bedstand it was a clever plan the baron said he kept his body shield tuned to maximum stopped facing his nephew but not clever enough tell me feyd why didnt you strike me down yourself youve had opportunity enough feydrautha found a suspensor chair accomplished a mental shrug as he sat down in it without being asked i must be bold now he thought you taught me that my own hands must remain clean he said ah yes the baron said when you face the emperor you must be able to say truthfully that you did not do the deed the witch at the emperors elbow will hear your words and know their truth or falsehood yes i warned you about that why havent you ever bought a bene gesserit uncle feydrautha asked with a truthsayer at your side you know my tastes the baron snapped feydrautha studied his uncle said still one would be valuable for i trust them not the baron snarled and stop trying to change the subject feydrautha spoke mildly as you wish uncle i remember a time in the arena several years ago the baron said it seemed there that day a slave had been set to kill you is that truly how it was its been so long ago uncle after all i no evasions please the baron said and the tightness of his voice exposed the rein on his anger feydrautha looked at his uncle thinking he knows else he wouldnt ask it was a sham uncle i arranged it to discredit your slavemaster very clever the baron said brave too that slavegladiator almost took you didnt he yes if you had finesse and subtlety to match such courage youd be truly formidable the baron shook his head from side to side and as he had done many times since that terrible day on arrakis he found himself regretting the loss of piter the mentat thered been a man of delicate devilish subtlety it hadnt saved him though again the baron shook his head fate was sometimes inscrutable feydrautha glanced around the bedchamber studying the signs of the struggle wondering how his uncle had overcome the slave theyd prepared so carefully how did i best him the baron asked ahhh now feyd let me keep some weapons to preserve me in my old age its better we use this time to strike a bargain feydrautha stared at him a bargain he means to keep me as his heir for certain then else why bargain one bargains with equals or near equals what bargain uncle and feydrautha felt proud that his voice remained calm and reasonable betraying none of the elation that filled him the baron too noted the control he nodded youre good material feyd i dont waste good material you persist however in refusing to learn my true value to you you are obstinate you do not see why i should be preserved as someone of the utmost value to you this he gestured at the evidence of the struggle in the bedchamber this was foolishness i do not reward foolishness get to the point you old fool feydrautha thought you think of me as an old fool the baron said i must dissuade you of that you speak of a bargain ah the impatience of youth the baron said well this is the substance of it then you will cease these foolish attempts on my life and i when you are ready for it will step aside in your favor i will retire to an advisory position leaving you in the seat of power retire uncle you still think me the fool the baron said and this but confirms it eh you think im begging you step cautiously feyd this old fool saw through the shielded needle youd planted in that slave boys thigh right where id put my hand on it eh the smallest pressure and snick a poison needle in the old fools palm ahhh feyd the baron shook his head thinking it wouldve worked too if hawat hadnt warned me well let the lad believe i saw the plot on my own in a way i did i was the one who saved hawat from the wreckage of arrakis and this lad needs greater respect for my prowess feydrautha remained silent struggling with himself is he being truthful does he really mean to retire why not im sure to succeed him one day if i move carefully he cant live forever perhaps it was foolish to try hurrying the process you speak of a bargain feydrautha said what pledge do we give to bind it how can we trust each other eh the baron asked well feyd as for you im setting thufir hawat to watch over you i trust hawats mentat capabilities in this do you understand me and as for me youll have to take me on faith but i cant live forever can i feyd and perhaps you should begin to suspect now that therere things i know which you should know i give you my pledge and what do you give me feydrautha asked i let you go on living the baron said again feydrautha studied his uncle he sets hawat over me what would he say if i told him hawat planned the trick with the gladiator that cost him his slavemaster hed likely say i was lying in the attempt to discredit hawat no the good thufir is a mentat and has anticipated this moment well what do you say the baron asked what can i say i accept of course and feydrautha thought hawat he plays both ends against the middle is that it has he moved to my uncles camp because i didnt counsel with him over the slave boy attempt you havent said anything about my setting hawat to watch you the baron said feydrautha betrayed anger by a flaring of nostrils the name of hawat had been a danger signal in the harkonnen family for so many years and now it had a new meaning still dangerous hawats a dangerous toy feydrautha said toy dont be stupid i know what i have in hawat and how to control it hawat has deep emotions feyd the man without emotions is the one to fear but deep emotions ah now those can be bent to your needs uncle i dont understand you yes thats plain enough only a flicker of eyelids betrayed the passage of resentment through feydrautha and you do not understand hawat the baron said nor do you feydrautha thought who does hawat blame for his present circumstances the baron asked me certainly but he was an atreides tool and bested me for years until the imperium took a hand thats how he sees it his hate for me is a casual thing now he believes he can best me any time believing this he is bested for i direct his attention where i want it against the imperium tensions of a new understanding drew tight lines across feydrauthas forehead thinned his mouth against the emperor let my dear nephew try the taste of that the baron thought let him say to himself the emperor feydrautha harkonnen let him ask himself how much thats worth surely it must be worth the life of one old uncle who could make that dream come to pass slowly feydrautha wet his lips with his tongue could it be true what the old fool was saying there was more here than there seemed to be and what has hawat to do with this feydrautha asked he thinks he uses us to wreak his revenge upon the emperor and when thats accomplished he does not think beyond his revenge hawats a man who must serve others and doesnt even know this about himself ive learned much from hawat feydrautha agreed and felt the truth of the words as he spoke them but the more i learn the more i feel we should dispose of him and soon you dont like the idea of his watching you hawat watches everybody and he may put you on a throne hawat is subtle he is dangerous devious but ill not yet withhold the antidote from him a sword is dangerous too feyd we have the scabbard for this one though the poisons in him when we withdraw the antidote death will sheathe him in a way its like the arena feydrautha said feints within feints within feints you watch to see which way the gladiator leans which way he looks how he holds his knife he nodded to himself seeing that these words pleased his uncle but thinking yes like the arena and the cutting edge is the mind now you see how you need me the baron said im yet of use feyd a sword to be wielded until hes too blunt for use feydrautha thought yes uncle he said and now the baron said we will go down to the slave quarters we two and i will watch while you with your own hands kill all the women in the pleasure wing uncle there will be other women feyd but i have said that you do not make a mistake casually with me feydrauthas face darkened uncle you you will accept your punishment and learn something from it the baron said feydrautha met the gloating stare in his uncles eyes and i must remember this night he thought and remembering it i must remember other nights you will not refuse the baron said what could you do if i refused old man feydrautha asked himself but he knew there might be some other punishment perhaps a more subtle one a more brutal lever to bend him i know you feyd the baron said you will not refuse all right feydrautha thought i need you now i see that the bargains made but ill not always need you and someday deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense but the real universe is always one step beyond logic from the sayings of muaddib by the princess irulan ive sat across from many rulers of great houses but never seen a more gross and dangerous pig than this one thufir hawat told himself you may speak plainly with me hawat the baron rumbled he leaned back in his suspensor chair the eyes in their folds of fat boring into hawat the old mentat looked down at the table between him and the baron vladimir harkonnen noting the opulence of its grain even this was a factor to consider in assessing the baron as were the red walls of this private conference room and the faint sweet herb scent that hung on the air masking a deeper musk you didnt have me send that warning to rabban as an idle whim the baron said hawats leathery old face remained impassive betraying none of the loathing he felt i suspect many things my lord he said yes well i wish to know how arrakis figures in your suspicions about salusa secundus it is not enough that you say to me the emperor is in a ferment about some association between arrakis and his mysterious prison planet now i rushed the warning out to rabban only because the courier had to leave on that heighliner you said there could be no delay well and good but now i will have an explanation he babbles too much hawat thought hes not like leto who could tell me a thing with the lift of an eyebrow or the wave of a hand nor like the old duke who could express an entire sentence in the way he accented a single word this is a clod destroying him will be a service to mankind you will not leave here until ive had a full and complete explanation the baron said you speak too casually of salusa secundus hawat said its a penal colony the baron said the worst riffraff in the galaxy are sent to salusa secundus what else do we need to know that conditions on the prison planet are more oppressive than anywhere else hawat said you hear that the mortality rate among new prisoners is higher than sixty per cent you hear that the emperor practices every form of oppression there you hear all this and do not ask questions the emperor doesnt permit the great houses to inspect his prison the baron growled but he hasnt seen into my dungeons either and curiosity about salusa secundus is ah hawat put a bony finger to his lips discouraged so hes not proud of some of the things he must do there hawat allowed the faintest of smiles to touch his dark lips his eyes glinted in the glowtube light as he stared at the baron and youve never wondered where the emperor gets his sardaukar the baron pursed his fat lips this gave his features the look of a pouting baby and his voice carried a tone of petulance as he said why he recruits that is to say there are the levies and he enlists from faaa hawat snapped the stories you hear about the exploits of the sardaukar theyre not rumors are they those are firsthand accounts from the limited number of survivors whove fought against the sardaukar eh the sardaukar are excellent fighting men no doubt of it the baron said but i think my own legions a pack of holiday excursionists by comparison hawat snarled you think i dont know why the emperor turned against house atreides this is not a realm open to your speculation the baron warned is it possible that even he doesnt know what motivated the emperor in this hawat asked himself any area is open to my speculation if it does what youve hired me to do hawat said i am a mentat you do not withhold information or computation lines from a mentat for a long minute the baron stared at him then say what you must say mentat the padishah emperor turned against house atreides because the dukes warmasters gurney halleck and duncan idaho had trained a fighting force a small fighting force to within a hair as good as the sardaukar some of them were even better and the duke was in a position to enlarge his force to make it every bit as strong as the emperors the baron weighed this disclosure then what has arrakis to do with this it provides a pool of recruits already conditioned to the bitterest survival training the baron shook his head you can not mean the fremen i mean the fremen hah then why warn rabban there can not be more than a handful of fremen left after the sardaukar pogrom and rabbans oppression hawat continued to stare at him silently not more than a handful the baron repeated rabban killed six thousand of them last year alone still hawat stared at him and the year before it was nine thousand the baron said and before they left the sardaukar mustve accounted for at least twenty thousand what are rabbans troop losses for the past two years hawat asked the baron rubbed his jowls well he has been recruiting rather heavily to be sure his agents make rather extravagant promises and shall we say thirty thousand in round numbers hawat asked that would seem a little high the baron said quite the contrary hawat said i can read between the lines of rabbans reports as well as you can and you certainly mustve understood my reports from our agents arrakis is a fierce planet the baron said storm losses can we both know the figure for storm accretion hawat said what if he has lost thirty thousand the baron demanded and blood darkened his face by your own count hawat said he killed fifteen thousand over two years while losing twice that number you say the sardaukar accounted for another twenty thousand possibly a few more and ive seen the transportation manifests for their return from arrakis if they killed twenty thousand they lost almost five for one why wont you face these figures baron and understand what they mean the baron spoke in a coldly measured cadence this is your job mentat what do they mean i gave you duncan idahos head count on the sietch he visited hawat said it all fits if they had just two hundred and fifty such sietch communities their population would be about five million my best estimate is that they had at least twice that many communities you scatter your population on such a planet ten million the barons jowls quivered with amazement at least the baron pursed his fat lips the beady eyes stared without wavering at hawat is this true mentat computation he wondered how could this be and no one suspect we havent even cut heavily into their birthrategrowth figure hawat said weve just weeded out some of their less successful specimens leaving the strong to grow stronger just like on salusa secundus salusa secundus the baron barked what has this to do with the emperors prison planet a man who survives salusa secundus starts out being tougher than most others hawat said when you add the very best of military training nonsense by your argument i could recruit from among the fremen after the way theyve been oppressed by my nephew hawat spoke in a mild voice dont you oppress any of your troops well i but oppression is a relative thing hawat said your fighting men are much better off than those around them heh they see unpleasant alternative to being soldiers of the baron heh the baron fell silent eyes unfocused the possibilities had rabban unwittingly given house harkonnen its ultimate weapon presently he said how could you be sure of the loyalty of such recruits i would take them in small groups not larger than platoon strength hawat said id remove them from their oppressive situation and isolate them with a training cadre of people who understood their background preferably people who had preceded them from the same oppressive situation then id fill them with the mystique that their planet had really been a secret training ground to produce just such superior beings as themselves and all the while id show them what such superior beings could earn rich living beautiful women fine mansions whatever they desired the baron began to nod the way the sardaukar live at home the recruits come to believe in time that such a place as salusa secundus is justified because it produced them the elite the commonest sardaukar trooper lives a life in many respects as exalted as that of any member of a great house such an idea the baron whispered you begin to share my suspicions hawat said where did such a thing start the baron asked ah yes where did house corrino originate were there people on salusa secundus before the emperor sent his first contingents of prisoners there even the duke leto a cousin on the distaff side never knew for sure such questions are not encouraged the barons eyes glazed with thought yes a very carefully kept secret theyd use every device of besides whats there to conceal hawat asked that the padishah emperor has a prison planet everyone knows this that he has count fenring the baron blurted hawat broke off studied the baron with a puzzled frown what of count fenring at my nephews birthday several years ago the baron said this imperial popinjay count fenring came as official observer and to ah conclude a business arrangement between the emperor and myself so i ah during one of our conversations i believe i said something about making a prison planet of arrakis fenring what did you say exactly hawat asked exactly that was quite a while ago and my lord baron if you wish to make the best use of my services you must give me adequate information wasnt this conversation recorded the barons face darkened with anger youre as bad as piter i dont like these piter is no longer with you my lord hawat said as to that whatever did happen to piter he became too familiar too demanding of me the baron said you assure me you dont waste a useful man hawat said will you waste me by threats and quibbling we were discussing what you said to count fenring slowly the baron composed his features when the time comes he thought ill remember his manner with me yes i will remember one moment the baron said and he thought back to the meeting in his great hall it helped to visualize the cone of silence in which they had stood i said something like this the baron said the emperor knows a certain amount of killing has always been an arm of business i was referring to our work force losses then i said something about considering another solution to the arrakeen problem and i said the emperors prison planet inspired me to emulate him witch blood hawat snapped what did fenring say thats when he began questioning me about you hawat sat back closed his eyes in thought so thats why they started looking into arrakis he said well the things done he opened his eyes they must have spies all over arrakis by now two years but certainly my innocent suggestion that nothing is innocent in an emperors eyes what were your instructions to rabban merely that he should teach arrakis to fear us hawat shook his head you now have two alternatives baron you can kill off the natives wipe them out entirely or waste an entire work force would you prefer to have the emperor and those great houses he can still swing behind him come in here and perform a curettement scrape out giedi prime like a hollow gourd the baron studied his mentat then he wouldnt dare wouldnt he the barons lips quivered what is your alternative abandon your dear nephew rabban aband the baron broke off stared at hawat send him no more troops no aid of any kind dont answer his messages other than to say youve heard of the terrible way hes handled things on arrakis and you intend to take corrective measures as soon as youre able ill arrange to have some of your messages intercepted by imperial spies but what of the spice the revenues the demand your baronial profits but be careful how you make your demands require fixed sums of rabban we can the baron turned his hands palms up but how can i be certain that my weasel nephew isnt we still have our spies on arrakis tell rabban he either meets the spice quotas you set him or hell be replaced i know my nephew the baron said this would only make him oppress the population even more of course he will hawat snapped you dont want that stopped now you merely want your own hands clean let rabban make your salusa secundus for you theres no need even to send him any prisoners he has all the population required if rabban is driving his people to meet your spice quotas then the emperor need suspect no other motive thats reason enough for putting the planet on the rack and you baron will not show by word or action that theres any other reason for this the baron could not keep the sly tone of admiration out of his voice ah hawat you are a devious one now how do we move into arrakis and make use of what rabban prepares thats the simplest thing of all baron if you set each years quota a bit higher than the one before matters will soon reach a head there production will drop off you can remove rabban and take over yourself to correct the mess it fits the baron said but i can feel myself tiring of all this im preparing another to take over arrakis for me hawat studied the fat round face across from him slowly the old soldierspy began to nod his head feydrautha he said so thats the reason for the oppression now youre very devious yourself baron perhaps we can incorporate these two schemes yes your feydrautha can go to arrakis as their savior he can win the populace yes the baron smiled and behind his smile he asked himself now how does this fit in with hawats personal scheming and hawat seeing that he was dismissed arose and left the redwalled room as he walked he could not put down the disturbing unknowns that cropped into every computation about arrakis this new religious leader that gurney halleck hinted at from his hiding place among the smugglers this muaddib perhaps i should not have told the baron to let this religion flourish where it will even among the folk of pan and graben he told himself but its well known that repression makes a religion flourish and he thought about hallecks reports on fremen battle tactics the tactics smacked of halleck himself and idaho and even of hawat did idaho survive he asked himself but this was a futile question he did not yet ask himself if it was possible that paul had survived he knew the baron was convinced that all atreides were dead the bene gesserit witch had been his weapon the baron admitted and that could only mean an end to all even to the womans own son what a poisonous hate she mustve had for the atreides he thought something like the hate i hold for this baron will my blow be as final and complete as hers there is in all things a pattern that is part of our universe it has symmetry elegance and grace those qualities you find always in that which the true artist captures you can find it in the turning of the seasons in the way sand trails along a ridge in the branch clusters of the creosote bush or the pattern of its leaves we try to copy these patterns in our lives and our society seeking the rhythms the dances the forms that comfort yet it is possible to see peril in the finding of ultimate perfection it is clear that the ultimate pattern contains its own fixity in such perfection all things move toward death from the collected sayings of muaddib by the princess irulan paulmuaddib remembered that there had been a meal heavy with spice essence he clung to this memory because it was an anchor point and he could tell himself from this vantage that his immediate experience must be a dream i am a theater of processes he told himself i am a prey to the imperfect vision to the race consciousness and its terrible purpose yet he could not escape the fear that he had somehow overrun himself lost his position in time so that past and future and present mingled without distinction it was a kind of visual fatigue and it came he knew from the constant necessity of holding the prescient future as a kind of memory that was in itself a thing intrinsically of the past chani prepared the meal for me he told himself yet chani was deep in the south in the cold country where the sun was hot secreted in one of the new sietch strongholds safe with their son leto ii or was that a thing yet to happen no he reassured himself for aliathestrangeone his sister had gone there with his mother and with chani a twentythumper trip into the south riding a reverend mothers palanquin fixed to the back of a wild maker he shied away from thought of riding the giant worms asking himself or is alia yet to be born i was on razzia paul recalled we went raiding to recover the water of our dead in arrakeen and i found the remains of my father in the funeral pyre i enshrined the skull of my father in a fremen rock mound overlooking harg pass or was that a thing yet to be my wounds are real paul told himself my scars are real the shrine of my fathers skull is real still in the dreamlike state paul remembered that harah jamis wife had intruded on him once to say thered been a fight in the sietch corridor that had been the interim sietch before the women and children had been sent into the deep south harah had stood there in the entrance to the inner chamber the black wings of her hair tied back by water rings on a chain she had held aside the chambers hangings and told him that chani had just killed someone this happened paul told himself this was real not born out of its time and subject to change paul remembered he had rushed out to find chani standing beneath the yellow globes of the corridor clad in a brilliant blue wraparound robe with hood thrown back a flush of exertion on her elfin features she had been sheathing her crysknife a huddled group had been hurrying away down the corridor with a burden and paul remembered telling himself you always know when theyre carrying a body chanis water rings worn openly in sietch on a cord around her neck tinkled as she turned toward him chani what is this he asked i dispatched one who came to challenge you in single combat usul you killed him yes but perhaps i shouldve left him for harah and paul recalled how the faces of the people around them had showed appreciation for these words even harah had laughed but he came to challenge me you trained me yourself in the weirding way usul certainly but you shouldnt i was born in the desert usul i know how to use a crysknife he suppressed his anger tried to talk reasonably this may all be true chani but i am no longer a child hunting scorpions in the sietch by the light of a handglobe usul i do not play games paul glared at her caught by the odd ferocity beneath her casual attitude he was not worthy usul chani said id not disturb your meditations with the likes of him she moved closer looking at him out of the corners of her eyes dropping her voice so that only he might hear and beloved when its learned that a challenger may face me and be brought to shameful death by muaddibs woman therell be fewer challengers yes paul told himself that had certainly happened it was truepast and the number of challengers testing the new blade of muaddib did drop dramatically somewhere in a world notofthedream there was a hint of motion the cry of a nightbird i dream paul reassured himself its the spice meal still there was about him a feeling of abandonment he wondered it if might be possible that his ruhspirit had slipped over somehow into the world where the fremen believed he had his true existence into the alam almithal the world of similitudes that metaphysical realm where all physical limitations were removed and he knew fear at the thought of such a place because removal of all limitations meant removal of all points of reference in the landscape of a myth he could not orient himself and say i am i because i am here his mother had said once the people are divided some of them in how they think of you i must be waking from the dream paul told himself for this had happened these words from his mother the lady jessica who was now a reverend mother of the fremen these words had passed through reality jessica was fearful of the religious relationship between himself and the fremen paul knew she didnt like the fact that people of both sietch and graben referred to muaddib as him and she went questioning among the tribes sending out her sayyadina spies collecting their answers and brooding on them she had quoted a bene gesserit proverb to him when religion and politics travel in the same cart the riders believe nothing can stand in their way their movement become headlong faster and faster and faster they put aside all thought of obstacles and forget that a precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until its too late paul recalled that he had sat there in his mothers quarters in the inner chamber shrouded by dark hangings with their surfaces covered by woven patterns out of fremen mythology he had sat there hearing her out noting the way she was always observing even when her eyes were lowered her oval face had new lines in it at the corners of the mouth but the hair was still like polished bronze the wideset green eyes though hid beneath their overcasting of spiceimbued blue the fremen have a simple practical religion he said nothing about religion is simple she warned but paul seeing the clouded future that still hung over them found himself swayed by anger he could only say religion unifies our forces its our mystique you deliberately cultivate this air this bravura she charged you never cease indoctrinating thus you yourself taught me he said but she had been full of contentions and arguments that day it had been the day of the circumcision ceremony for little leto paul had understood some of the reasons for her upset she had never accepted his liaison the marriage of youth with chani but chani had produced an atreides son and jessica had found herself unable to reject the child with the mother jessica had stirred finally under his stare said you think me an unnatural mother of course not i see the way you watch me when im with your sister you dont understand about your sister i know why alia is different he said she was unborn part of you when you changed the water of life she you know nothing of it and paul suddenly unable to express the knowledge gained out of its time said only i dont think you unnatural she saw his distress said there is a thing son yes i do love your chani i accept her this was real paul told himself this wasnt the imperfect vision to be changed by the twistings out of times own birth the reassurance gave him a new hold on his world bits of solid reality began to dip through the dream state into his awareness he knew suddenly that he was in a hiereg a desert camp chani had planted their stilltent on floursand for its softness that could only mean chani was near by chani his soul chani his sihaya sweet as the desert spring chani up from the palmaries of the deep south now he remembered her singing a sand chanty to him in the time for sleep o my soul have no taste for paradise this night and i swear by shaihulud you will go there obedient to my love and she had sung the walking song lovers shared on the sand its rhythm like the drag of the dunes against the feet tell me of thine eyes and i will tell thee of thy heart tell me of thy feet and i will tell thee of thy hands tell me of thy sleeping and i will tell thee of thy waking tell me of thy desires and i will tell thee of thy need he had heard someone strumming a baliset in another tent and hed thought then of gurney halleck reminded by the familiar instrument he had thought of gurney whose face he had seen in a smuggler band but who had not seen him could not see him or know of him lest that inadvertently lead the harkonnens to the son of the duke they had killed but the style of the player in the night the distinctiveness of the fingers on the balisets strings brought the real musician back to pauls memory it had been chatt the leaper captain of the fedaykin leader of the death commandos who guarded muaddib we are in the desert paul remembered we are in the central erg beyond the harkonnen patrols i am here to walk the sand to lure a maker and mount him by my own cunning that i may be a fremen entire he felt now the maula pistol at his belt the crysknife he felt the silence surrounding him it was that special premorning silence when the nightbirds had gone and the day creatures had not yet signaled their alertness to their enemy the sun you must ride the sand in the light of day that shaihulud shall see and know you have no fear stilgar had said thus we turn our time around and set ourselves to sleep this night quietly paul sat up feeling the looseness of a slacked stillsuit around his body the shadowed stilltent beyond so softly he moved yet chani heard him she spoke from the tents gloom another shadow there its not yet full light beloved sihaya he said speaking with half a laugh in his voice you call me your desert spring she said but this day im thy goad i am the sayyadina who watches that the rites be obeyed he began tightening his stillsuit you told me once the words of the kitab alibar he said you told me woman is thy field go then to thy field and till it i am the mother of thy firstborn she agreed he saw her in the grayness matching him movement for movement securing her stillsuit for the open desert you should get all the rest you can she said he recognized her love for him speaking then and chided her gently the sayyadina of the watch does not caution or warn the candidate she slid across to his side touched his cheek with her palm today i am both the watcher and the woman you shouldve left this duty to another he said waiting is bad enough at best she said id sooner be at thy side he kissed her palm before securing the faceflap of his suit then turned and cracked the seal of the tent the air that came in to them held the chill notquitedryness that would precipitate trace dew in the dawn with it came the smell of a prespice mass the mass they had detected off to the northeast and that told them there would be a maker near by paul crawled through the sphincter opening stood on the sand and stretched the sleep from his muscles a faint greenpearl luminescence etched the eastern horizon the tents of his troop were small false dunes around him in the gloom he saw movement off to the left the guard and knew they had seen him they knew the peril he faced this day each fremen had faced it they gave him this last few moments of isolation now that he might prepare himself it must be done today he told himself he thought of the power he wielded in the face of the pogrom the old men who sent their sons to him to be trained in the weirding way of battle the old men who listened to him now in council and followed his plans the men who returned to pay him that highest fremen compliment your plan worked muaddib yet the meanest and smallest of the fremen warriors could do a thing that he had never done and paul knew his leadership suffered from the omnipresent knowledge of this difference between them he had not ridden the maker oh hed gone up with the others for training trips and raids but he had not made his own voyage until he did his world was bounded by the abilities of others no true fremen could permit this until he did this thing himself even the great southlands the area some twenty thumpers beyond the erg were denied him unless he ordered a palanquin and rode like a reverend mother or one of the sick and wounded memory returned to him of his wrestling with his inner awareness during the night he saw a strange parallel here if he mastered the maker his rule was strengthened if he mastered the inward eye this carried its own measure of command but beyond them both lay the clouded area the great unrest where all the universe seemed embroiled the differences in the ways he comprehended the universe haunted him accuracy matched with inaccuracy he saw it in situ yet when it was born when it came into the pressures of reality the now had its own life and grew with its own subtle differences terrible purpose remained race consciousness remained and over all loomed the jihad bloody and wild chani joined him outside the tent hugging her elbows looking up at him from the corners of her eyes the way she did when she studied his mood tell me again about the waters of thy birthworld usul she said he saw that she was trying to distract him ease his mind of tensions before the deadly test it was growing lighter and he noted that some of his fedaykin were already striking their tents id rather you told me about the sietch and about our son he said does our leto yet hold my mother in his palm its alia he holds as well she said and he grows rapidly hell be a big man whats it like in the south he asked when you ride the maker youll see for yourself she said but i wish to see it first through your eyes its powerfully lonely she said he touched the nezhoni scarf at her forehead where it protruded from her stillsuit cap why will you not talk about the sietch i have talked about it the sietch is a lonely place without our men its a place of work we labor in the factories and the potting rooms there are weapons to be made poles to plant that we may forecast the weather spice to collect for the bribes there are dunes to be planted to make them grow and to anchor them there are fabrics and rugs to make fuel cells to charge there are children to train that the tribes strength may never be lost is nothing then pleasant in the sietch he asked the children are pleasant we observe the rites we have sufficient food sometimes one of us may come north to be with her man life must go on my sister alia is she accepted yet by the people chani turned toward him in the growing dawnlight her eyes bored into him its a thing to be discussed another time beloved let us discuss it now you should conserve your energies for the test she said he saw that he had touched something sensitive hearing the withdrawal in her voice the unknown brings its own worries he said presently she nodded said there is yet misunderstanding because of alias strangeness the women are fearful because a child little more than an infant talks of things that only an adult should know they do not understand the change in the womb that made alia different there is trouble he asked and he thought ive seen visions of trouble over alia chani looked toward the growing line of the sunrise some of the women banded to appeal to the reverend mother they demanded she exorcise the demon in her daughter they quoted the scripture suffer not a witch to live among us and what did my mother say to them she recited the law and sent the women away abashed she said if alia incites trouble it is the fault of authority for not foreseeing and preventing the trouble and she tried to explain how the change had worked on alia in the womb but the women were angry because they had been embarrassed they went away muttering there will be trouble because of alia he thought a crystal blowing of sand touched the exposed portions of his face bringing the scent of the prespice mass el sayal the rain of sand that brings the morning he said he looked out across the gray light of the desert landscape the landscape beyond pity the sand that was form absorbed in itself dry lightning streaked a dark corner to the south sign that a storm had built up its static charge there the roll of thunder boomed long after the voice that beautifies the land chani said more of his men were stirring out of their tents guards were coming in from the rims everything around him moved smoothly in the ancient routine that required no orders give as few orders as possible his father had told him once long ago once youve given orders on a subject you must always give orders on that subject the fremen knew this rule instinctively the troops watermaster began the morning chanty adding to it now the call for the rite to initiate a sandrider the world is a carcass the man chanted his voice wailing across the dunes who can turn away the angel of death what shaihulud has decreed must be paul listened recognizing that these were the words that also began the death chant of his fedaykin the words the death commandos recited as they buried themselves into battle will there be a rock shrine here this day to mark the passing of another soul paul asked himself will fremen stop here in the future each to add another stone and think on muaddib who died in this place he knew this was among the alternatives today a fact along lines of the future radiating from this position in timespace the imperfect vision plagued him the more he resisted his terrible purpose and fought against the coming of the jihad the greater the turmoil that wove through his prescience his entire future was becoming like a river hurtling toward a chasm the violent nexus beyond which all was fog and clouds stilgar approaches chani said i must stand apart now beloved now i must be sayyadina and observe the rite that it may be reported truly in the chronicles she looked up at him and for a moment her reserve slipped then she had herself under control when this is past i shall prepare thy breakfast with my own hands she said she turned away stilgar moved toward him across the flour sand stirring up little dust puddles the dark niches of his eyes remained steady on paul with their untamed stare the glimpse of black beard above the stillsuit mask the lines of craggy cheeks could have been windetched from the native rock for all their movement the man carried pauls banner on its staff the green and black banner with a water tube in the staff that already was a legend in the land half pridefully paul thought i can not do the simplest thing without its becoming a legend they will mark how i parted from chani how i greet stilgar every move i make this day live or die it is a legend i must not die then it will be only legend and nothing to stop the jihad stilgar planted the staff in the sand beside paul dropped his hands to his sides the bluewithinblue eyes remained level and intent and paul thought how his own eyes already were assuming this mask of color from the spice they denied us the hajj stilgar said with ritual solemnity as chani had taught him paul responded who can deny a fremen the right to walk or ride where he wills i am a naib stilgar said never to be taken alive i am a leg of the death tripod that will destroy our foes silence settled over them paul glanced at the other fremen scattered over the sand beyond stilgar the way they stood without moving for this moment of personal prayer and he thought of how the fremen were a people whose living consisted of killing an entire people who had lived with rage and grief all of their days never once considering what might take the place of either except for a dream with which lietkynes had infused them before his death where is the lord who led us through the land of desert and of pits stilgar asked he is ever with us the fremen chanted stilgar squared his shoulders stepped closer to paul and lowered his voice now remember what i told you do it simply and directly nothing fancy among our people we ride the maker at the age of twelve you are more than six years beyond that age and not born to this life you dont have to impress anyone with your courage we know you are brave all you must do is call the maker and ride him i will remember paul said see that you do ill not have you shame my teaching stilgar pulled a plastic rod about a meter long from beneath his robe the thing was pointed at one end had a springwound clapper at the other end i prepared this thumper myself its a good one take it paul felt the warm smoothness of the plastic as he accepted the thumper shishakli has your hooks stilgar said hell hand them to you as you step out onto that dune over there he pointed to his right call a big maker usul show us the way paul marked the tone of stilgars voice half ritual and half that of a worried friend in that instant the sun seemed to bound above the horizon the sky took on the silvered grayblue that warned this would be a day of extreme heat and dryness even for arrakis it is the time of the scalding day stilgar said and now his voice was entirely ritual go usul and ride the maker travel the sand as a leader of men paul saluted his banner noting how the green and black flag hung limply now that the dawn wind had died he turned toward the dune stilgar had indicated a dirty tan slope with an strack crest already most of the troop was moving out in the opposite direction climbing the other dune that had sheltered their camp one robed figure remained in pauls path shishakli a squad leader of the fedaykin only his slopelidded eyes visible between stillsuit cap and mask shishakli presented two thin whiplike shafts as paul approached the shafts were about a meter and a half long with glistening plasteel hoods at one end roughened at the other end for a firm grip paul accepted them both in his left hand as required by the ritual they are my own hooks shishakli said in a husky voice they never have failed paul nodded maintaining the necessary silence moved past the man and up the dune slope at the crest he glanced back saw the troop scattering like a flight of insects their robes fluttering he stood alone now on the sandy ridge with only the horizon in front of him the flat and unmoving horizon this was a good dune stilgar had chosen higher than its companions for the viewpoint vantage stooping paul planted the thumper deep into the windward face where the sand was compacted and would give maximum transmission to the drumming then he hesitated reviewing the lessons reviewing the lifeanddeath necessities that faced him when he threw the latch the thumper would begin its summons across the sand a giant worm a maker would hear and come to the drumming with the whiplike hookstaffs paul knew he could mount the makers high curving back for as long as a forward edge of a worms ring segment was held open by a hook open to admit abrasive sand into the more sensitive interior the creature would not retreat beneath the desert it would in fact roll its gigantic body to bring the opened segment as far away from the desert surface as possible i am a sandrider paul told himself he glanced down at the hooks in his left hand thinking that he had only to shift those hooks down the curve of a makers immense side to make the creature roll and turn guiding it where he willed he had seen it done he had been helped up the side of a worm for a short ride in training the captive worm could be ridden until it lay exhausted and quiescent upon the desert surface and a new maker must be summoned once he was past this test paul knew he was qualified to make the twentythumper journey into the southland to rest and restore himself into the south where the women and the families had been hidden from the pogrom among the new palmaries and sietch warrens he lifted his head and looked to the south reminding himself that the maker summoned wild from the erg was an unknown quantity and the one who summoned it was equally unknown to this test you must gauge the approaching maker carefully stilgar had explained you must stand close enough that you can mount it as it passes yet not so close that it engulfs you with abrupt decision paul released the thumpers latch the clapper began revolving and the summons drummed through the sand a measured lump lump lump he straightened scanning the horizon remembering stilgars words judge the line of approach carefully remember a worm seldom makes an unseen approach to a thumper listen all the same you may often hear it before you see it and chanis words of caution whispered at night when her fear for him overcame her filled his mind when you take your stand along the makers path you must remain utterly still you must think like a patch of sand hide beneath your cloak and become a little dune in your very essence slowly he scanned the horizon listening watching for the signs he had been taught it came from the southeast a distant hissing a sandwhisper presently he saw the faraway outline of the creatures track against the dawnlight and realized he had never before seen a maker this large never heard of one this size it appeared to be more than half a league long and the rise of the sandwave at its cresting head was like the approach of a mountain this is nothing i have seen by vision or in life paul cautioned himself he hurried across the path of the thing to take his stand caught up entirely by the rushing needs of this moment control the coinage and the courts let the rabble have the rest thus the padishah emperor advises you and he tells you if you want profits you must rule there is truth in these words but i ask myself who are the rabble and who are the ruled muaddibs secret message to the landsraad from arrakis awakening by the princess irulan a thought came unbidden to jessicas mind paul will be undergoing his sandrider test at any moment now they try to conceal this fact from me but its obvious and chani has gone on some mysterious errand jessica sat in her resting chamber catching a moment of quiet between the nights classes it was a pleasant chamber but not as large as the one she had enjoyed in sietch tabr before their flight from the pogrom still this place had thick rugs on the floor soft cushions a low coffee table near at hand multicolored hangings on the walls and soft yellow glowglobes overhead the room was permeated with the distinctive acrid furry odor of a fremen sietch that she had come to associate with a sense of security yet she knew she would never overcome a feeling of being in an alien place it was the harshness that the rugs and hangings attempted to conceal a faint tinklingdrummingslapping penetrated to the resting chamber jessica knew it for a birth celebration probably subiays her time was near and jessica knew shed see the baby soon enough a blueeyed cherub brought to the reverend mother for blessing she knew also that her daughter alia would be at the celebration and would report on it it was not yet time for the nightly prayer of parting they wouldnt have started a birth celebration near the time of ceremony that mourned the slave raids of poritrin bela tegeuse rossak and harmonthep jessica sighed she knew she was trying to keep her thoughts off her son and the dangers he faced the pit traps with their poisoned barbs the harkonnen raids although these were growing fewer as the fremen took their toll of aircraft and raiders with the new weapons paul had given them and the natural dangers of the desert makers and thirst and dust chasms she thought of calling for coffee and with the thought came that everpresent awareness of paradox in the fremen way of life how well they lived in these sietch caverns compared to the graben pyons yet how much more they endured in the open hajr of the desert than anything the harkonnen bondsmen endured a dark hand inserted itself through the hangings beside her deposited a cup upon the table and withdrew from the cup arose the aroma of spiced coffee an offering from the birth celebration jessica thought she took the coffee and sipped it smiling at herself in what other society of our universe she asked herself could a person of my station accept an anonymous drink and quaff that drink without fear i could alter any poison now before it did me harm or course but the donor doesnt realize this she drained the cup feeling the energy and lift of its contents hot and delicious and she wondered what other society would have such a natural regard for her privacy and comfort that the giver would intrude only enough to deposit the gift and not inflict her with the donor respect and love had sent the gift with only a slight tinge of fear another element of the incident forced itself into her awareness she had thought of coffee and it had appeared there was nothing of telepathy here she knew it was the tau the oneness of the sietch community a compensation from the subtle poison of the spice diet they shared the great mass of the people could never hope to attain the enlightenment the spice seed brought to her they had not been trained and prepared for it their minds rejected what they could not understand or encompass still they felt and reacted sometimes like a single organism and the thought of coincidence never entered their minds has paul passed his test on the sand jessica asked herself hes capable but accident can strike down even the most capable the waiting its the dreariness she thought you can wait just so long then the dreariness of the waiting overcomes you there was all manner of waiting in their lives more than two years weve been here she thought and twice that number at least to go before we can even hope to think of trying to wrest arrakis from the harkonnen governor the mudir nahya the beast rabban reverend mother the voice from outside the hangings at her door was that of harah the other woman in pauls menage yes harah the hangings parted and harah seemed to glide through them she wore sietch sandals a redyellow wraparound that exposed her arms almost to the shoulders her black hair was parted in the middle and swept back like the wings of an insect flat and oily against her head the jutting predatory features were drawn into an intense frown behind harah came alia a girlchild of about two years seeing her daughter jessica was caught as she frequently was by alias resemblance to paul at that age the same wideeyed solemnity to her questing look the dark hair and firmness of mouth but there were subtle differences too and it was in these that most adults found alia disquieting the child little more than a toddler carried herself with a calmness and awareness beyond her years adults were shocked to find her laughing at a subtle play of words between the sexes or theyd catch themselves listening to her halflisping voice still blurred as it was by an unformed soft palate and discover in her words sly remarks that could only be based on experiences no twoyearold had ever encountered harah sank to a cushion with an exasperated sigh frowned at the child alia jessica motioned to her daughter the child crossed to a cushion beside her mother sank to it and clasped her mothers hand the contact of flesh restored that mutual awareness they had shared since before alias birth it wasnt a matter of shared thoughts although there were bursts of that if they touched while jessica was changing the spice poison for a ceremony it was something larger an immediate awareness of another living spark a sharp and poignant thing a nervesympatico that made them emotionally one in the formal manner that befitted a member of her sons household jessica said subakh ul kuhar harah this night finds you well with the same traditional formality she said subakh un nar i am well the words were almost toneless again she sighed jessica sensed amusement from alia my brothers ghanima is annoyed with me alia said in her halflisp jessica marked the term alia used to refer to harah ghanima in the subtleties of the fremen tongue the word meant something acquired in battle and with the added overtone that the something no longer was used for its original purpose an ornament a spearhead used as a curtain weight harah scowled at the child dont try to insult me child i know my place what have you done this time alia jessica asked harah answered not only has she refused to play with the other children today but she intruded where i hid behind the hangings and watched subiays child being born alia said its a boy he cried and cried what a set of lungs when hed cried long enough she came out and touched him harah said and he stopped crying everyone knows a fremen baby must get his crying done at birth if hes in sietch because he can never cry again lest he betray us on hajr hed cried enough alia said i just wanted to feel his spark his life thats all and when he felt me he didnt want to cry anymore its just made more talk among the people harah said subiays boy is healthy jessica asked she saw that something was troubling harah deeply and wondered at it healthy as any mother could ask harah said they know alia didnt hurt him they didnt so much mind her touching him he settled down right away and was happy it was harah shrugged its the strangeness of my daughter is that it jessica asked its the way she speaks of things beyond her years and of things no child her age could know things of the past how could she know what a child looked like on bela tegeuse harah demanded but he does alia said subiays boy looks just like the son of mitha born before the parting alia jessica said i warned you but mother i saw it and it was true and jessica shook her head seeing the signs of disturbance in harahs face what have i borne jessica asked herself a daughter who knew at birth everything that i knew and more everything revealed to her out of the corridors of the past by the reverend mothers within me its not just the things she says harah said its the exercises too the way she sits and stares at a rock moving only one muscle beside her nose or a muscle on the back of a finger or those are the bene gesserit training jessica said you know that harah would you deny my daughter her inheritance reverend mother you know these things dont matter to me harah said its the people and the way they mutter i feel danger in it they say your daughters a demon that other children refuse to play with her that shes she has so little in common with the other children jessica said shes no demon its just the of course shes not jessica found herself surprised at the vehemence in harahs tone glanced down at alia the child appeared lost in thought radiating a sense of waiting jessica returned her attention to harah i respect the fact that youre a member of my sons household jessica said alia stirred against her hand you may speak openly with me of whatevers troubling you i will not be a member of your sons household much longer harah said ive waited this long for the sake of my sons the special training they receive as the children of usul its little enough i could give them since its known i dont share your sons bed again alia stirred beside her halfsleeping warm youd have made a good companion for my son though jessica said and she added to herself because such thoughts were ever with her companion not a wife jessicas thoughts went then straight to the center to the pang that came from the common talk in the sietch that her sons companionship with chani had become a permanent thing the marriage i love chani jessica thought but she reminded herself that love might have to step aside for royal necessity royal marriages had other reasons than love you think i dont know what you plan for your son harah asked what do you mean jessica demanded you plan to unite the tribes under him harah said is that bad i see danger for him and alia is part of that danger alia nestled closer to her mother eyes opened now and studying harah ive watched you two together harah said the way you touch and alia is like my own flesh because shes sister to one who is like my brother ive watched over her and guarded her from the time she was a mere baby from the time of the razzia when we fled here ive seen many things about her jessica nodded feeling disquiet begin to grow in alia beside her you know what i mean harah said the way she knew from the first what we were saying to her when has there been another baby who knew the water discipline so young what other babys first words to her nurse were i love you harah harah stared at alia why do you think i accept her insults i know theres no malice in them alia looked up at her mother yes i have reasoning powers reverend mother harah said i could have been of the sayyadina i have seen what i have seen harah jessica shrugged i dont know what to say and she felt surprise at herself because this literally was true alia straightened squared her shoulders jessica felt the sense of waiting ended an emotion compounded of decision and sadness we made a mistake alia said now we need harah it was the ceremony of the seed harah said when you changed the water of life reverend mother when alia was yet unborn within you need harah jessica asked herself who else can talk among the people and make them begin to understand me alia asked what would you have her do jessica asked she already knows what to do alia said i will tell them the truth harah said her face seemed suddenly old and sad with its olive skin drawn into frown wrinkles a witchery in the sharp features i will tell them that alia only pretends to be a little girl that she has never been a little girl alia shook her head tears ran down her cheeks and jessica felt the wave of sadness from her daughter as though the emotion were her own i know im a freak alia whispered the adult summation coming from the child mouth was like a bitter confirmation youre not a freak harah snapped who dared say youre a freak again jessica marveled at the fierce note of protectiveness in harahs voice jessica saw then that alia had judged correctly they did need harah the tribe would understand harah both her words and her emotions for it was obvious she loved alia as though this were her own child who said it harah repeated nobody alia used a corner of jessicas aba to wipe the tears from her face she smoothed the robe where she had dampened and crumpled it then dont you say it harah ordered yes harah now harah said you may tell me what it was like so that i may tell the others tell me what it is that happened to you alia swallowed looked up at her mother jessica nodded one day i woke up alia said it was like waking from sleep except that i could not remember going to sleep i was in a warm dark place and i was frightened listening to the halflisping voice of her daughter jessica remembered that day in the big cavern when i was frightened alia said i tried to escape but there was no way to escape then i saw a spark but it wasnt exactly like seeing it the spark was just there with me and i felt the sparks emotions soothing me comforting me telling me that way that everything would be all right that was my mother harah rubbed at her eyes smiled reassuringly at alia yet there was a look of wildness in the eyes of the fremen woman an intensity as though they too were trying to hear alias words and jessica thought what do we really know of how such a one thinks out of her unique experiences and training and ancestry just when i felt safe and reassured alia said there was another spark with us and everything was happening at once the other spark was the old reverend mother she was trading lives with my mother everything and i was there with them seeing it all everything and it was over and i was them and all the others and myself only it took me a long time to find myself again there were so many others it was a cruel thing jessica said no being should wake into consciousness thus the wonder of it is you could accept all that happened to you i couldnt do anything else alia said i didnt know how to reject or hide my consciousness or shut if off everything just happened everything we didnt know harah murmured when we gave your mother the water to change we didnt know you existed within her dont be sad about it harah alia said i shouldnt feel sorry for myself after all theres cause for happiness here im a reverend mother the tribe has two rev she broke off tipping her head to listen harah rocked back on her heels against the sitting cushion stared at alia bringing her attention then up to jessicas face didnt you suspect jessica asked shhhh alia said a distant rhythmic chanting came to them through the hangings that separated them from the sietch corridors it grew louder carrying distinct sounds now ya ya yawm ya ya yawm mu zein wallah ya ya yawm mu zein wallah the chanters passed the outer entrance and their voices boomed through to the inner apartments slowly the sound receded when the sound had dimmed sufficiently jessica began the ritual the sadness in her voice it was ramadhan and april on bela tegeuse my family sat in their pool courtyard harah said in air bathed by the moisture that arose from the spray of a fountain there was a tree of portyguls round and deep in color near at hand there was a basket with mish mish and baklawa and mugs of liban all manner of good things to eat in our gardens and in our flocks there was peace peace in all the land life was full with happiness until the raiders came alia said blood ran cold at the scream of friends jessica said and she felt the memories rushing through her out of all those other pasts she shared la la la the women cried said harah the raiders came through the mushtamal rushing at us with their knives dripping red from the lives of our men jessica said silence came over the three of them as it was in all the apartments of the sietch the silence while they remembered and kept their grief thus fresh presently harah uttered the ritual ending to the ceremony giving the words a harshness that jessica had never before heard in them we will never forgive and we will never forget harah said in the thoughtful quiet that followed her words they heard a muttering of people the swish of many robes jessica sensed someone standing beyond the hangings that shielded her chamber reverend mother a womans voice and jessica recognized it the voice of tharthar one of stilgars wives what is it tharthar there is trouble reverend mother jessica felt a constriction at her heart an abrupt fear for paul paul she gasped tharthar spread the hangings stepped into the chamber jessica glimpsed a press of people in the outer room before the hangings fell she looked up at tharthar a small dark woman in a redfigured robe of black the total blue of her eyes trained fixedly on jessica the nostrils of her tiny nose dilated to reveal the plug scars what is it jessica demanded there is word from the sand tharthar said usul meets the maker for his test it is today the young men say he can not fail he will be a sandrider by nightfall the young men are banding for a razzia they will raid in the north and meet usul there they say they will raise the cry then they say they will force him to call out stilgar and assume command of the tribes gathering water planting the dunes changing their world slowly but surely these are no longer enough jessica thought the little raids the certain raids these are no longer enough now that paul and i have trained them they feel their power they want to fight tharthar shifted from one foot to the other cleared her throat we know the need for cautious waiting jessica thought but theres the core of our frustration we know also the harm that waiting extended too long can do us we lose our senses of purpose if the waitings prolonged the young men say if usul does not call out stilgar then he must be afraid tharthar said she lowered her gaze so thats the way of it jessica muttered and she thought well i saw it coming as did stilgar again tharthar cleared her throat even my brother shoab says it she said they will leave usul no choice then it has come jessica thought and paul will have to handle it himself the reverend mother dare not become involved in the succession alia freed her hand from her mothers said i will go with tharthar and listen to the young men perhaps there is a way jessica met tharthars gaze but spoke to alia go then and report to me as soon as you can we do not want this thing to happen reverend mother tharthar said we do not want it jessica agreed the tribe needs all its strength she glanced at harah will you go with them harah answered the unspoken part of the question tharthar will allow no harm to befall alia she knows we will soon be wives together she and i to share the same man we have talked tharthar and i harah looked up at tharthar back to jessica we have an understanding tharthar held out a hand for alia said we must hurry the young men are leaving they pressed through the hangings the childs hand in the small womans hand but the child seemed to be leading if paulmuaddib slays stilgar this will not serve the tribe harah said always before it has been the way of succession but times have changed times have changed for you as well jessica said you can not think i doubt the outcome of such a battle harah said usul could not but win that was my meaning jessica said and you think my personal feelings enter into my judgment harah said she shook her head her water rings tinkling at her neck how wrong you are perhaps you think as well that i regret not being the chosen of usul that i am jealous of chani you make your own choice as you are able jessica said i pity chani harah said jessica stiffened what do you mean i know what you think of chani harah said you think she is not the wife for your son jessica settled back relaxed on her cushions she shrugged perhaps you could be right harah said if you are you may find a surprising ally chani herself she wants whatever is best for him jessica swallowed past a sudden tightening in her throat chanis very dear to me she said she could be no your rugs are very dirty in here harah said she swept her gaze around the floor avoiding jessicas eyes so many people tramping through here all the time you really should have them cleaned more often you can not avoid the interplay of politics within an orthodox religion this power struggle permeates the training educating and disciplining of the orthodox community because of this pressure the leaders of such a community inevitably must face that ultimate internal question to succumb to complete opportunism as the price of maintaining their rule or risk sacrificing themselves for the sake of the orthodox ethic from muaddib the religious issues by the princess irulan paul waited on the sand outside the gigantic makers line of approach i must not wait like a smuggler impatient and jittering he reminded himself i must be part of the desert the thing was only minutes away now filling the morning with the frictionhissing of its passage its great teeth within the caverncircle of its mouth spread like some enormous flower the spice odor from it dominated the air pauls stillsuit rode easily on his body and he was only distantly aware of his nose plugs the breathing mask stilgars teaching the painstaking hours on the sand overshadowed all else how far outside the makers radius must you stand in pea sand stilgar had asked him and he had answered correctly half a meter for every meter of the makers diameter why to avoid the vortex of its passage and still have time to run in and mount it youve ridden the little ones bred for the seed and the water of life stilgar had said but what youll summon for your test is a wild maker an old man of the desert you must have proper respect for such a one now the thumpers deep drumming blended with the hiss of the approaching worm paul breathed deeply smelling mineral bitterness of sand even through his filters the wild maker the old man of the desert loomed almost on him its cresting front segments threw a sandwave that would sweep across his knees come up you lovely monster he thought up you hear me calling come up come up the wave lifted his feet surface dust swept across him he steadied himself his world dominated by the passage of that sandclouded curving wall that segmented cliff the ring lines sharply defined in it paul lifted his hooks sighted along them leaned in he felt them bite and pull he leaped upward planting his feet against that wall leaning out against the clinging barbs this was the true instant of the testing if he had planted the hooks correctly at the leading edge of a ring segment opening the segment the worm would not roll down and crush him the worm slowed it glided across the thumper silencing it slowly it began to roll up up bringing those irritant barbs as high as possible away from the sand that threatened the soft inner lapping of its ring segment paul found himself riding upright atop the worm he felt exultant like an emperor surveying his world he suppressed a sudden urge to cavort there to turn the worm to show off his mastery of this creature suddenly he understood why stilgar had warned him once about brash young men who danced and played with these monsters doing handstands on their backs removing both hooks and replanting them before the worm could spill them leaving one hook in place paul released the other and planted it lower down the side when the second hook was firm and tested he brought down the first one thus worked his way down the side the maker rolled and as it rolled it turned coming around the sweep of flour sand where the others waited paul saw them come up using their hooks to climb but avoiding the sensitive ring edges until they were on top they rode at last in a triple line behind him steadied against their hooks stilgar moved up through the ranks checked the positioning of pauls hooks glanced up at pauls smiling face you did it eh stilgar asked raising his voice above the hiss of their passage thats what you think you did it he straightened now i tell you that was a very sloppy job we have twelveyearolds who do better there was drumsand to your left where you waited you could not retreat there if the worm turned that way the smile slipped from pauls face i saw the drumsand then why did you not signal for one of us to take up position secondary to you it was a thing you could do even in the test paul swallowed faced into the wind of their passage you think it bad of me to say this now stilgar said it is my duty i think of your worth to the troop if you had stumbled into that drumsand the maker wouldve turned toward you in spite of a surge of anger paul knew that stilgar spoke the truth it took a long minute and the full effort of the training he had received from his mother for paul to recapture a feeling of calm i apologize he said it will not happen again in a tight position always leave yourself a secondary someone to take the maker if you can not stilgar said remember that we work together that way were certain we work together eh he slapped pauls shoulder we work together paul agreed now stilgar said and his voice was harsh show me you know how to handle a maker which side are we on paul glanced down at the scaled ring surface on which they stood noted the character and size of the scales the way they grew larger off to his right smaller to his left every worm he knew moved characteristically with one side up more frequently as it grew older the characteristic upside became an almost constant thing bottom scales grew larger heavier smoother top scales could be told by size alone on a big worm shifting his hooks paul moved to the left he motioned flankers down to open segments along the side and keep the worm on a straight course as it rolled when he had it turned he motioned two steersmen out of the line and into positions ahead ach haiiiiiyoh he shouted in the traditional call the leftside steersman opened a ring segment there in a majestic circle the maker turned to protect its opened segment full around it came and when it was headed back to the south paul shouted geyrat the steersman released his hook the maker lined out in a straight course stilgar said very good paul muaddib with plenty of practice you may yet become a sandrider paul frowned thinking was i not first up from behind him there came sudden laughter the troop began chanting flinging his name against the sky muaddib muaddib muaddib muaddib and far to the rear along the worms surface paul heard the beat of the goaders pounding the tail segments the worm began picking up speed their robes flapped in the wind the abrasive sound of their passage increased paul looked back through the troop found chanis face among them he looked at her as he spoke to stilgar then i am a sandrider stil hal yawm you are a sandrider this day then i may choose our destination thats the way of it and i am a fremen born this day here in the habbanya erg i have had no life before this day i was as a child until this day not quite a child stilgar said he fastened a corner of his hood where the wind was whipping it but there was a cork sealing off my world and that cork has been pulled there is no cork i would go south stilgar twenty thumpers i would see this land we make this land that ive only seen through the eyes of others and i would see my son and my family he thought i need time now to consider the future that is a past within my mind the turmoil comes and if im not where i can unravel it the thing will run wild stilgar looked at him with a steady measuring gaze paul kept his attention on chani seeing the interest quicken in her face noting also the excitement his words had kindled in the troop the men are eager to raid with you in the harkonnen sinks stilgar said the sinks are only a thumper away the fedaykin have raided with me paul said theyll raid with me again until no harkonnen breathes arrakeen air stilgar studied him as they rode and paul realized the man was seeing this moment through the memory of how he had risen to command of the tabr sietch and to leadership of the council of leaders now that lietkynes was dead he has heard the reports of unrest among the young fremen paul thought do you wish a gathering of the leaders stilgar asked eyes blazed among the young men of the troop they swayed as they rode and they watched and paul saw the look of unrest in chanis glance the way she looked from stilgar who was her uncle to paulmuaddib who was her mate you can not guess what i want paul said and he thought i can not back down i must hold control over these people you are mudir of the sandride this day stilgar said cold formality rang in his voice how do you use this power we need time to relax time for cool reflection paul thought we shall go south paul said even if i say we shall turn back to the north when this day is over we shall go south paul repeated a sense of inevitable dignity enfolded stilgar as he pulled his robe tightly around him there will be a gathering he said i will send the messages he thinks i will call him out paul thought and he knows he can not stand against me paul faced south feeling the wind against his exposed cheeks thinking of the necessities that went into his decisions they do not know how it is he thought but he knew he could not let any consideration deflect him he had to remain on the central line of the time storm he could see in the future there would come an instant when it could be unraveled but only if he were where he could cut the central knot of it i will not call him out if it can be helped he thought if theres another way to prevent the jihad well camp for the evening meal and prayer at cave of birds beneath habbanya ridge stilgar said he steadied himself with one hook against the swaying of the maker gestured ahead at a low rock barrier rising out of the desert paul studied the cliff the great streaks of rock crossing it like waves no green no blossom softened that rigid horizon beyond it stretched the way to the southern desert a course of at least ten days and nights as fast as they could goad the makers twenty thumpers the way led far beyond the harkonnen patrols he knew how it would be the dreams had shown him one day as they went there d be a faint change of color on the far horizon such a slight change that he might feel he was imagining it out of his hopes and there would be the new sietch does my decision suit muaddib stilgar asked only the faintest touch of sarcasm tinged his voice but fremen ears around them alert to every tone in a birds cry or a cielagos piping message heard the sarcasm and watched paul to see what he would do stilgar heard me swear my loyalty to him when we consecrated the fedaykin paul said my death commandos know i spoke with honor does stilgar doubt it real pain exposed itself in pauls voice stilgar heard it and lowered his gaze usul the companion of my sietch him i would never doubt stilgar said but you are paulmuaddib the atreides duke and you are the lisan algaib the voice from the outer world these men i dont even know paul turned away to watch the habbanya ridge climb out of the desert the maker beneath them still felt strong and willing it could carry them almost twice the distance of any other in fremen experience he knew it there was nothing outside the stories told to children that could match this old man of the desert it was the stuff of a new legend paul realized a hand gripped his shoulder paul looked at it followed the arm to the face beyond it the dark eyes of stilgar exposed between filter mask and stillsuit hood the one who led tabr sietch before me stilgar said he was my friend we shared dangers he owed me his life many a time and i owed him mine i am your friend stilgar paul said no man doubts it stilgar said he removed his hand shrugged its the way paul saw that stilgar was too immersed in the fremen way to consider the possibility of any other here a leader took the reins from the dead hands of his predecessor or slew among the strongest of his tribe if a leader died in the desert stilgar had risen to be a naib in that way we should leave this maker in deep sand paul said yes stilgar agreed we could walk to the cave from here weve ridden him far enough that hell bury himself and sulk for a day or so paul said youre the mudir of the sandride stilgar said say when we he broke off stared at the eastern sky paul whirled the spiceblue overcast on his eyes made the sky appear dark a richly filtered azure against which a distant rhythmic flashing stood out in sharp contrast ornithopter one small thopter stilgar said could be a scout paul said do you think theyve seen us at this distance were just a worm on the surface stilgar said he motioned with his left hand off scatter on the sand the troop began working down the worms sides dropping off blending with the sand beneath their cloaks paul marked where chani dropped presently only he and stilgar remained first up last off paul said stilgar nodded dropped down the side on his hooks leaped onto the sand paul waited until the maker was safely clear of the scatter area then released his hooks this was the tricky moment with a worm not completely exhausted freed of its goads and hooks the big worm began burrowing into the sand paul ran lightly back along its broad surface judged his moment carefully and leaped off he landed running lunged against the slipface of a dune the way he had been taught and hid himself beneath the cascade of sand over his robe now the waiting paul turned gently exposed a crack of sky beneath a crease in his robe he imagined the others back along their path doing the same he heard the beat of the thopters wings before he saw it there was a whisper of jetpods and it came over his patch of desert turned in a broad arc toward the ridge an unmarked thopter paul noted it flew out of sight beyond habbanya ridge a bird cry sounded over the desert another paul shook himself free of sand climbed to the dune top other figures stood out in a line trailing away from the ridge he recognized chani and stilgar among them stilgar signaled toward the ridge they gathered and began the sandwalk gliding over the surface in a broken rhythm that would disturb no maker stilgar paced himself beside paul along the windpacked crest of a dune it was a smuggler craft stilgar said so it seemed paul said but this is deep into the desert for smugglers theyve their difficulties with patrols too stilgar said if they come this deep they may go deeper paul said true it wouldnt be well for them to see what they could see if they ventured too deep into the south smugglers sell information too they were hunting spice dont you think stilgar asked there will be a wing and a crawler waiting somewhere for that one paul said weve spice lets bait a patch of sand and catch us some smugglers they should be taught that this is our land and our men need practice with the new weapons now usul speaks stilgar said usul thinks fremen but usul must give way to decisions that match a terrible purpose paul thought and the storm was gathering when law and duty are one united by religion you never become fully conscious fully aware of yourself you are always a little less than an individual from muaddib the ninetynine wonders of the universe by princess irulan the smugglers spice factory with its parent carrier and ring of drone ornithopters came over a lifting of dunes like a swarm of insects following its queen ahead of the swarm lay one of the low rock ridges that lifted from the desert floor like small imitations of the shield wall the dry beaches of the ridge were swept clean by a recent storm in the conbubble of the factory gurney halleck leaned forward adjusted the oil lenses of his binoculars and examined the landscape beyond the ridge he could see a dark patch that might be a spiceblow and he gave the signal to a hovering ornithopter that sent it to investigate the thopter waggled its wings to indicate it had the signal it broke away from the swarm sped down toward the darkened sand circled the area with its detectors dangling close to the surface almost immediately it went through the wingtucked dip and circle that told the waiting factory that spice had been found gurney sheathed his binoculars knowing the others had seen the signal he liked this spot the ridge offered some shielding and protection this was deep in the desert an unlikely place for an ambush still gurney signaled for a crew to hover over the ridge to scan it sent reserves to take up station in pattern around the area not too high because then they could be seen from afar by harkonnen detectors he doubted though that harkonnen patrols would be this far south this was still fremen country gurney checked his weapons damning the fate that made shields useless out here anything that summoned a worm had to be avoided at all costs he rubbed the inkvine scar along his jaw studying the scene decided it would be safest to lead a ground party through the ridge inspection on foot was still the most certain you couldnt be too careful when fremen and harkonnen were at each others throats it was fremen that worried him here they didnt mind trading for all the spice you could afford but they were devils on the warpath if you stepped foot where they forbade you to go and they were so devilishly cunning of late it annoyed gurney the cunning and adroitness in battle of these natives they displayed a sophistication in warfare as good as anything he had ever encountered and he had been trained by the best fighters in the universe then seasoned in battles where only the superior few survived again gurney scanned the landscape wondering why he felt uneasy perhaps it was the worm they had seen but that was on the other side of the ridge a head popped up into the conbubble beside gurney the factory commander a oneeyed old pirate with full beard the blue eyes and milky teeth of a spice diet looks like a rich patch sir the factory commander said shall i take er in come down at the edge of that ridge gurney ordered let me disembark with my men you can tractor out to the spice from there well have a look at that rock aye in case of trouble gurney said save the factory well lift in the thopters the factory commander saluted aye sir he popped back down through the hatch again gurney scanned the horizon he had to respect the possibility that there were fremen here and he was trespassing fremen worried him their toughness and unpredictability many things about this business worried him but the rewards were great the fact that he couldnt send spotters high overhead worried him too the necessity of radio silence added to his uneasiness the factory crawler turned began to descend gently it glided down to the dry beach at the foot of the ridge treads touched sand gurney opened the bubble dome released his safety straps the instant the factory stopped he was out slamming the bubble closed behind him scrambling out over the tread guards to swing down to the sand beyond the emergency netting the five men of his personal guard were out with him emerging from the nose hatch others released the factorys carrier wing it detached lifted away to fly in a parking circle low overhead immediately the big factory crawler lurched off swinging away from the ridge toward the dark patch of spice out on the sand a thopter swooped down nearby skidded to a stop another followed and another they disgorged gurneys platoon and lifted to hoverflight gurney tested his muscles in his stillsuit stretching he left the filter mask off his face losing moisture for the sake of a greater need the carrying power of his voice if he had to shout commands he began climbing up into the rocks checking the terrain pebbles and pea sand underfoot the smell of spice good site for an emergency base he thought might be sensible to bury a few supplies here he glanced back watching his men spread out as they followed him good men even the new ones he hadnt had time to test good men didnt have to be told every time what to do not a shield glimmer showed on any of them no cowards in this bunch carrying shields into the desert where a worm could sense the field and come to rob them of the spice they found from this slight elevation in the rocks gurney could see the spice patch about half a kilometer away and the crawler just reaching the near edge he glanced up at the coverflight noting the altitude not too high he nodded to himself turned to resume his climb up the ridge in that instant the ridge erupted twelve roaring paths of flame streaked upward to the hovering thopters and carrier wing there came a blasting of metal from the factory crawler and the rocks around gurney were full of hooded fighting men gurney had time to think by the horns of the great mother rockets they dare to use rockets then he was face to face with a hooded figure who crouched low crysknife at the ready two more men stood waiting on the rocks above to left and right only the eyes of the fighting man ahead of him were visible to gurney between hood and veil of a sandcolored burnoose but the crouch and readiness warned him that here was a trained fighting man the eyes were the blueinblue of the deepdesert fremen gurney moved one hand toward his own knife kept his eyes fixed on the others knife if they dared use rockets theyd have other projectile weapons this moment argued extreme caution he could tell by sound alone that at least part of his skycover had been knocked out there were gruntings too the noise of several struggles behind him the eyes of the fighting man ahead of gurney followed the motion of hand toward knife came back to glare into gurneys eyes leave the knife in its sheath gurney halleck the man said gurney hesitated that voice sounded oddly familiar even through a stillsuit filter you know my name he said youve no need of a knife with me gurney the man said he straightened slipped his crysknife into its sheath back beneath his robe tell your men to stop their useless resistance the man threw his hood back swung the filter aside the shock of what he saw froze gurneys muscles he thought at first he was looking at a ghost image of duke leto atreides full recognition came slowly paul he whispered then louder is it truly paul dont you trust your own eyes paul asked they said you were dead gurney rasped he took a halfstep forward tell your men to submit paul commanded he waved toward the lower reaches of the ridge gurney turned reluctant to take his eyes off paul he saw only a few knots of struggle hooded desert men seemed to be everywhere around the factory crawler lay silent with fremen standing atop it there were no aircraft overhead stop the fighting gurney bellowed he took a deep breath cupped his hands for a megaphone this is gurney halleck stop the fight slowly warily the struggling figures separated eyes turned toward him questioning these are friends gurney called fine friends someone shouted back half our people murdered its a mistake gurney said dont add to it he turned back to paul stared into the youths blueblue fremen eyes a smile touched pauls mouth but there was a hardness in the expression that reminded gurney of the old duke pauls grandfather gurney saw then the sinewy harshness in paul that had never before been seen in an atreides a leathery look to the skin a squint to the eyes and calculation in the glance that seemed to weigh everything in sight they said you were dead gurney repeated and it seemed the best protection to let them think so paul said gurney realized that was all the apology hed ever get for having been abandoned to his own resources left to believe his young duke his friend was dead he wondered then if there were anything left here of the boy he had known and trained in the ways of fighting men paul took a step closer to gurney found that his eyes were smarting gurney it seemed to happen of itself and they were embracing pounding each other on the back feeling the reassurance of solid flesh you young pup you young pup gurney kept saying and paul gurney man gurney man presently they stepped apart looked at each other gurney took a deep breath so youre why the fremen have grown so wise in battle tactics i mightve known they keep doing things i couldve planned myself if id only known he shook his head if youd only got word to me lad nothing wouldve stopped me id have come arunning and a look in pauls eyes stopped him the hard weighing stare gurney sighed sure and thered have been those who wondered why gurney halleck went arunning and some wouldve done more than question theyd have gone hunting for answers paul nodded glanced to the waiting fremen around them the looks of curious appraisal on the faces of the fedaykin he turned from the death commandos back to gurney finding his former swordmaster filled him with elation he saw it as a good omen a sign that he was on the course of the future where all was well with gurney at my side paul glanced down the ridge past the fedaykin studied the smuggler crew who had come with halleck how do your men stand gurney he asked theyre smugglers all gurney said they stand where the profit is little enough profit in our venture paul said and he noted the subtle finger signal flashed to him by gurneys right hand the old hand code out of their past there were men to fear and distrust in the smuggler crew paul pulled at his lip to indicate he understood looked up at the men standing guard above them on the rocks he saw stilgar there memory of the unsolved problem with stilgar cooled some of pauls elation stilgar he said this is gurney halleck of whom youve heard me speak my fathers masterofarms one of the swordmasters who instructed me an old friend he can be trusted in any venture i hear stilgar said you are his duke paul stared at the dark visage above him wondering at the reasons which had impelled stilgar to say just that his duke there had been a strange subtle intonation in stilgars voice as though he would rather have said something else and that wasnt like stilgar who was a leader of fremen a man who spoke his mind my duke gurney thought he looked anew at paul yes with leto dead the title fell on pauls shoulders the pattern of the fremen war on arrakis began to take on new shape in gurneys mind my duke a place that had been dead within him began coming alive only part of his awareness focused on pauls ordering the smuggler crew disarmed until they could be questioned gurneys mind returned to the command when he heard some of his men protesting he shook his head whirled are you men deaf he barked this is the rightful duke of arrakis do as he commands grumbling the smugglers submitted paul moved up beside gurney spoke in a low voice id not have expected you to walk into this trap gurney im properly chastened gurney said ill wager yon patch of spice is little more than a sand grains thickness a bait to lure us thats a wager youd win paul said he looked down at the men being disarmed are there any more of my fathers men among your crew none were spread thin therere a few among the free traders most have spent their profits to leave this place but you stayed i stayed because rabban is here paul said i thought i had nothing left but revenge gurney said an oddly chopped cry sounded from the ridgetop gurney looked up to see a fremen waving his kerchief a maker comes paul said he moved out to a point of rock with gurney following looked off to the southwest the burrow mound of a worm could be seen in the middle distance a dustcrowned track that cut directly through the dunes on a course toward the ridge hes big enough paul said a clattering sound lifted from the factory crawler below them it turned on its treads like a giant insect lumbered toward the rocks too bad we couldnt have saved the carryall paul said gurney glanced at him looked back to the patches of smoke and debris out on the desert where carryall and ornithopters had been brought down by fremen rockets he felt a sudden pang for the men lost there his men and he said your father wouldve been more concerned for the men he couldnt save paul shot a hard stare at him lowered his gaze presently he said they were your friends gurney i understand to us though they were trespassers who might see things they shouldnt see you must understand that i understand it well enough gurney said now im curious to see what i shouldnt paul looked up to see the old and wellremembered wolfish grin on hallecks face the ripple of the inkvine scar along the mans jaw gurney nodded toward the desert below them fremen were going about their business all over the landscape it struck him that none of them appeared worried by the approach of the worm a thumping sounded from the open dunes beyond the baited patch of spice a deep drumming that seemed to be heard through their feet gurney saw fremen spread out across the sand there in the path of the worm the worm came on like some great sandfish cresting the surface its rings rippling and twisting in a moment from his vantage point above the desert gurney saw the taking of a worm the daring leap of the first hookman the turning of the creature the way an entire band of men went up the scaly glistening curve of the worms side theres one of the things you shouldnt have seen paul said theres been stories and rumors gurney said but its not a thing easy to believe without seeing it he shook his head the creature all men on arrakis fear you treat it like a riding animal you heard my father speak of desert power paul said there it is the surface of this planet is ours no storm nor creature nor condition can stop us us gurney thought he means the fremen he speaks of himself as one of them again gurney looked at the spice blue in pauls eyes his own eyes he knew had a touch of the color but smugglers could get offworld foods and there was a subtle caste implication in the tone of the eyes among them they spoke of the touch of the spicebrush to mean a man had gone too native and there was always a hint of distrust in the idea there was a time when we did not ride the maker in the light of day in these latitudes paul said but rabban has little enough air cover left that he can waste it looking for a few specks in the sand he looked at gurney your aircraft were a shock to us here to us to us gurney shook his head to drive out such thoughts we werent the shock to you that you were to us he said whats the talk of rabban in the sinks and villages paul asked they say theyve fortified the graben villages to the point where you can not harm them they say they need only sit inside their defenses while you wear yourselves out in futile attack in a word paul said theyre immobilized while you can go where you will gurney said its a tactic i learned from you paul said theyve lost the initiative which means theyve lost the war gurney smiled a slow knowing expression our enemy is exactly where i want him to be paul said he glanced at gurney well gurney do you enlist with me for the finish of this campaign enlist gurney stared at him my lord ive never left your service youre the only one left me to think you dead and i being cast adrift made what shrift i could waiting for the moment i might sell my life for what its worth the death of rabban an embarrassed silence settled over paul a woman came climbing up the rocks toward them her eyes between stillsuit hood and facemask flicking between paul and his companion she stopped in front of paul gurney noted the possessive air about her the way she stood close to paul chani paul said this is gurney halleck youve heard me speak of him she looked at halleck back to paul i have heard where did the men go on the maker paul asked they but diverted it to give us time to save the equipment well then paul broke off sniffed the air theres wind coming chani said a voice called out from the ridgetop above them ho there the wind gurney saw a quickening of motion among the fremen now a rushing about and sense of hurry a thing the worm had not ignited was brought about by fear of the wind the factory crawler lumbered up onto the dry beach below them and a way was opened for it among the rocks and the rocks closed behind it so neatly that the passage escaped his eyes have you many such hiding places gurney asked many times many paul said he looked at chani find korba tell him that gurney has warned me there are men among this smuggler crew whore not to be trusted she looked once at gurney back to paul nodded and was off down the rocks leaping with a gazellelike agility she is your woman gurney said the mother of my firstborn paul said theres another leto among the atreides gurney accepted this with only a widening of the eyes paul watched the action around them with a critical eye a curry color dominated the southern sky now and there came fitful bursts and gusts of wind that whipped dust around their heads seal your suit paul said and he fastened the mask and hood about his face gurney obeyed thankful for the filters paul spoke his voice muffled by the filter which of your crew dont you trust gurney therere some new recruits gurney said offworlders he hesitated wondering at himself suddenly offworlders the word had come so easily to his tongue yes paul said theyre not like the usual fortunehunting lot we get gurney said theyre tougher harkonnen spies paul asked i think mlord that they report to no harkonnen i suspect theyre men of the imperial service they have a hint of salusa secundus about them paul shot a sharp glance at him sardaukar gurney shrugged they could be but its well masked paul nodded thinking how easily gurney had fallen back into the pattern of atreides retainer but with subtle reservations differences arrakis had changed him too two hooded fremen emerged from the broken rock below them began climbing upward one of them carried a large black bundle over one shoulder where are my crew now gurney asked secure in the rocks below us paul said weve a cave here cave of birds well decide what to do with them after the storm a voice called from above them muaddib paul turned at the call saw a fremen guard motioning them down to the cave paul signaled he had heard gurney studying him with a new expression youre muaddib he asked youre the willothesand its my fremen name paul said gurney turned away feeling an oppressive sense of foreboding half his own crew dead on the sand the others captive he did not care about the new recruits the suspicious ones but among the others were good men friends people for whom he felt responsible well decide what to do with them after the storm thats what paul had said muaddib had said and gurney recalled the stories told of muaddib the lisan algaib how he had taken the skin of a harkonnen officer to make his drumheads how he was surrounded by death commandos fedaykin who leaped into battle with their death chants on their lips him the two fremen climbing up the rocks leaped lightly to a shelf in front of paul the darkfaced one said all secure muaddib we best get below now right gurney noted the tone of the mans voice half command and half request this was the man called stilgar another figure of the new fremen legends paul looked at the bundle the other man carried said korba whats in the bundle stilgar answered twas in the crawler it had the initial of your friend here and it contains a baliset many times have i heard you speak of the prowess of gurney halleck on the baliset gurney studied the speaker seeing the edge of black beard above the stillsuit mask the hawk stare the chiseled nose youve a companion who thinks mlord gurney said thank you stilgar stilgar signaled for his companion to pass the bundle to gurney said thank your lord duke his countenance earns your admittance here gurney accepted the bundle puzzled by the hard undertones in this conversation there was an air of challenge about the man and gurney wondered if it could be a feeling of jealousy in the fremen here was someone called gurney halleck whod known paul even in the times before arrakis a man who shared a camaraderie that stilgar could never invade you are two id have be friends paul said stilgar the fremen is a name of renown gurney said any killer of harkonnens id feel honored to count among my friends will you touch hands with my friend gurney halleck stilgar paul asked slowly stilgar extended his hand gripped the heavy calluses of gurneys swordhand therere few who havent heard the name of gurney halleck he said and released his grip he turned to paul the storm comes rushing at once paul said stilgar turned away led them down through the rocks a twisting and turning path into a shadowed cleft that admitted them to the low entrance of a cave men hurried to fasten a doorseal behind them glowglobes showed a broad domeceilinged space with a raised ledge on one side and a passage leading off from it paul leaped to the ledge with gurney right behind him led the way into the passage the others headed for another passage opposite the entrance paul led the way through an anteroom and into a chamber with dark winecolored hangings on its walls we can have some privacy here for a while paul said the others will respect my an alarm cymbal clanged from the outer chamber was followed by shouting and clashing of weapons paul whirled ran back through the anteroom and out onto the atrium lip above the outer chamber gurney was right behind weapon drawn beneath them on the floor of the cave swirled a melee of struggling figures paul stood an instant assessing the scene separating the fremen robes and bourkas from the costumes of those they opposed senses that his mother had trained to detect the most subtle clues picked out a significant fact the fremen fought against men wearing smuggler robes but the smugglers were crouched in trios backed into triangles where pressed that habit of close fighting was a trademark of the imperial sardaukar a fedaykin in the crowd saw paul and his battlecry was lifted to echo in the chamber muaddib muaddib muaddib another eye had also picked paul out a black knife came hurtling toward him paul dodged heard the knife clatter against stone behind him glanced to see gurney retrieve it the triangular knots were being pressed back now gurney held the knife up in front of pauls eyes pointed to the hairline yellow coil of imperial color the golden lion crest multifaceted eyes at the pommel sardaukar for certain paul stepped out to the lip of the ledge only three of the sardaukar remained bloody rag mounds of sardaukar and fremen lay in a twisted pattern across the chamber hold paul shouted the duke paul atreides commands you to hold the fighting wavered hesitated you sardaukar paul called to the remaining group by whose orders do you threaten a ruling duke and quickly as his men started to press in around the sardaukar hold i say one of the cornered trio straightened who says were sardaukar he demanded paul took the knife from gurney held it aloft this says youre sardaukar then who says youre a ruling duke the man demanded paul gestured to the fedaykin these men say im a ruling duke your own emperor bestowed arrakis on house atreides i am house atreides the sardaukar stood silent fidgeting paul studied the man tall flatfeatured with a pale scar across half his left cheek anger and confusion were betrayed in his manner but still there was that pride about him without which a sardaukar appeared undressed and with which he could appear fully clothed though naked paul glanced to one of his fedaykin lieutenants said korba how came they to have weapons they held back knives concealed in cunning pockets within their stillsuits the lieutenant said paul surveyed the dead and wounded across the chamber brought his attention back to the lieutenant there was no need for words the lieutenant lowered his eyes where is chani paul asked and waited breath held for the answer stilgar spirited her aside he nodded toward the other passage glanced at the dead and wounded i hold myself responsible for this mistake muaddib how many of these sardaukar were there gurney paul asked ten paul leaped lightly to the floor of the chamber strode across to stand within striking distance of the sardaukar spokesman a tense air came over the fedaykin they did not like him thus exposed to danger this was the thing they were pledged to prevent because the fremen wished to preserve the wisdom of muaddib without turning paul spoke to his lieutenant how many are our casualties four wounded two dead muaddib paul saw motion beyond the sardaukar chani and stilgar were standing in the other passage he returned his attention to the sardaukar staring into the offworld whites of the spokesmans eyes you what is your name paul demanded the man stiffened glanced left and right dont try it paul said its obvious to me that you were ordered to seek out and destroy muaddib ill warrant you were the ones suggested seeking spice in the deep desert a gasp from gurney behind him brought a thin smile to pauls lips blood suffused the sardaukars face what you see before you is more than muaddib paul said seven of you are dead for two of us three for one pretty good against sardaukar eh the man came up on his toes sank back as the fedaykin pressed forward i asked your name paul said and he called up the subtleties of voice tell me your name captain aramsham imperial sardaukar the man snapped his jaw dropped he stared at paul in confusion the manner about him that had dismissed this cavern as a barbarian warren melted away well captain aramsham paul said the harkonnens would pay dearly to learn what you now know and the emperor what he wouldnt give to learn an atreides still lives despite his treachery the captain glanced left and right at the two men remaining to him paul could almost see the thoughts turning over in the mans head sardaukar did not submit but the emperor had to learn of this threat still using the voice paul said submit captain the man at the captains left leaped without warning toward paul met the flashing impact of his own captains knife in his chest the attacker hit the floor in a sodden heap with the knife still in him the captain faced his sole remaining companion i decide what best serves his majesty he said understood the other sardaukars shoulders slumped drop your weapon the captain said the sardaukar obeyed the captain returned his attention to paul i have killed a friend for you he said let us always remember that youre my prisoners paul said you submitted to me whether you live or die is of no importance he motioned to his guard to take the two sardaukar signaled the lieutenant who had searched the prisoners the guard moved in hustled the sardaukar away paul bent toward his lieutenant muaddib the man said i failed you in the failure was mine korba paul said i shouldve warned you what to seek in the future when searching sardaukar remember this remember too that each has a false toenail or two that can be combined with other items secreted about their bodies to make an effective transmitter theyll have more than one false tooth they carry coils of shigawire in their hair so fine you can barely detect it yet strong enough to garrote a man and cut off his head in the process with sardaukar you must scan them scope them both reflex and hard ray cut off every scrap of body hair and when youre through be certain you havent discovered everything he looked up at gurney who had moved close to listen then we best kill them the lieutenant said paul shook his head still looking at gurney no i want them to escape gurney stared at him sire he breathed yes your man here is right kill those prisoners at once destroy all evidence of them youve shamed imperial sardaukar when the emperor learns that hell not rest until he has you over a slow fire the emperors not likely to have that power over me paul said he spoke slowly coldly something had happened inside him while he faced the sardaukar a sum of decisions had accumulated in his awareness gurney he said are there many guildsmen around rabban gurney straightened eyes narrowed your question makes no are there paul barked arrakis is crawling with guild agents theyre buying spice as though it were the most precious thing in the universe why else do you think we ventured this far into it is the most precious thing in the universe paul said to them he looked toward stilgar and chani who were now crossing the chamber toward him and we control it gurney the harkonnens control it gurney protested the people who can destroy a thing they control it paul said he waved a hand to silence further remarks from gurney nodded to stilgar who stopped in front of paul chani beside him paul took the sardaukar knife in his left hand presented it to stilgar you live for the good of the tribe paul said could you draw my lifes blood with that knife for the good of the tribe stilgar growled then use that knife paul said are you calling me out stilgar demanded if i do paul said i shall stand there without weapon and let you slay me stilgar drew in a quick sharp breath chani said usul then glanced at gurney back to paul while stilgar was still weighing his words paul said you are stilgar a fighting man when the sardaukar began fighting here you were not in the front of battle your first thought was to protect chani shes my niece stilgar said if thered been any doubt of your fedaykin handling those scum why was your first thought of chani paul demanded it wasnt oh it was of you stilgar admitted do you think you could lift your hand against me paul asked stilgar began to tremble its the way he muttered its the way to kill offworld strangers found in the desert and take their water as a gift from shaihulud paul said yet you permitted two such to live one night my mother and myself as stilgar remained silent trembling staring at him paul said ways change stil you have changed them yourself stilgar looked down at the yellow emblem on the knife he held when i am duke in arrakeen with chani by my side do you think ill have time to concern myself with every detail of governing tabr sietch paul asked do you concern yourself with the internal problems of every family stilgar continued staring at the knife do you think i wish to cut off my right arm paul demanded slowly stilgar looked up at him you paul said do you think i wish to deprive myself or the tribe of your wisdom and strength in a low voice stilgar said the young man of my tribe whose name is known to me this young man i could kill on the challenge floor shaihulud willing the lisan algaib him i could not harm you knew this when you handed me this knife i knew it paul agreed stilgar opened his hand the knife clattered against the stone of the floor ways change he said chani paul said go to my mother send her here that her counsel will be available in but you said we would go to the south she protested i was wrong he said the harkonnens are not there the war is not there she took a deep breath accepting this as a desert woman accepted all necessities in the midst of a life involved with death you will give my mother a message for her ears alone paul said tell her that stilgar acknowledges me duke of arrakis but a way must be found to make the young men accept this without combat chani glanced at stilgar do as he says stilgar growled we both know he could overcome me and i could not raise my hand against him for the good of the tribe i shall return with your mother chani said send her paul said stilgars instinct was right i am stronger when you are safe you will remain in the sietch she started to protest swallowed it sihaya paul said using his intimate name for her he whirled away to the right met gurneys glaring eyes the interchange between paul and the older fremen had passed as though in a cloud around gurney since pauls reference to his mother your mother gurney said idaho saved us the night of the raid paul said distracted by the parting with chani right now weve what of duncan idaho mlord gurney asked hes dead buying us a bit of time to escape the shewitch alive gurney thought the one i swore vengeance against alive and its obvious duke paul doesnt know what manner of creature gave him birth the evil one betrayed his own father to the harkonnens paul pressed past him jumped up to the ledge he glanced back noted that the wounded and dead had been removed and he thought bitterly that here was another chapter in the legend of paul muaddib i didnt even draw my knife but itll be said of this day that i slew twenty sardaukar by my own hand gurney followed with stilgar stepping on ground that he did not even feel the cavern with its yellow light of glowglobes was forced out of his thoughts by rage the shewitch alive while those she betrayed are bones in lonesome graves i must contrive it that paul learns the truth about her before i slay her how often it is that the angry man rages denial of what his inner self is telling him the collected sayings of muaddib by the princess irulan the crowd in the cavern assembly chamber radiated that pack feeling jessica had sensed the day paul killed jamis there was murmuring nervousness in the voices little cliques gathered like knots among the robes jessica tucked a message cylinder beneath her robe as she emerged to the ledge from pauls private quarters she felt rested after the long journey up from the south but still rankled that paul would not yet permit them to use the captured ornithopters we do not have full control of the air he had said and we must not become dependent upon offworld fuel both fuel and aircraft must be gathered and saved for the day of maximum effort paul stood with a group of the younger men near the ledge the pale light of glowglobes gave the scene a tinge of unreality it was like a tableau but with the added dimension of warren smells the whispers the sounds of shuffling feet she studied her son wondering why he had not yet trotted out his surprise gurney halleck thought of gurney disturbed her with its memories of an easier past days of love and beauty with pauls father stilgar waited with a small group of his own at the other end of the ledge there was a feeling of inevitable dignity about him the way he stood without talking we must not lose that man jessica thought pauls plan must work anything else would be highest tragedy she strode down the ledge passing stilgar without a glance stepped down into the crowd a way was made for her as she headed toward paul and silence followed her she knew the meaning of the silence the unspoken questions of the people awe of the reverend mother the young men drew back from paul as she came up to him and she found herself momentarily dismayed by the new deference they paid him all men beneath your position covet your station went the bene gesserit axiom but she found no covetousness in these faces they were held at a distance by the religious ferment around pauls leadership and she recalled another bene gesserit saying prophets have a way of dying by violence paul looked at her its time she said and passed the message cylinder to him one of pauls companions bolder than the others glanced across at stilgar said are you going to call him out muaddib nows the time for sure theyll think you a coward if you who dares call me coward paul demanded his hand flashed to his crysknife hilt bated silence came over the group spreading out into the crowd theres work to do paul said as the man drew back from him paul turned away shouldered through the crowd to the ledge leaped lightly up to it and faced the people do it someone shrieked murmurs and whispers arose behind the shriek paul waited for silence it came slowly amidst scattered shufflings and coughs when it was quiet in the cavern paul lifted his chin spoke in a voice that carried to the farthest corners you are tired of waiting paul said again he waited while the cries of response died out indeed they are tired of waiting paul thought he hefted the message cylinder thinking of what it contained his mother had showed it to him explaining how it had been taken from a harkonnen courier the message was explicit rabban was being abandoned to his own resources here on arrakis he could not call for help or reinforcements again paul raised his voice you think its time i called out stilgar and changed the leadership of the troops before they could respond paul hurled his voice at them in anger do you think the lisan algaib that stupid there was stunned silence hes accepting the religious mantle jessica thought he must not do it its the way someone shouted paul spoke dryly probing the emotional undercurrents ways change an angry voice lifted from a corner of the cavern well say whats to change there were scattered shouts of agreement through the throng as you wish paul said and jessica heard the subtle intonations as he used the powers of voice she had taught him you will say he agreed but first you will hear my say stilgar moved along the ledge his bearded face impassive that is the way too he said the voice of any fremen may be heard in council paulmuaddib is a fremen the good of the tribe that is the most important thing eh paul asked still with that flatvoiced dignity stilgar said thus our steps are guided all right paul said then who rules this troop of our tribe and who rules all the tribes and troops through the fighting instructors weve trained in the weirding way paul waited looking over the heads of the throng no answer came presently he said does stilgar rule all this he says himself that he does not do i rule even stilgar does my bidding on occasion and the sages the wisest of the wise listen to me and honor me in council there was shuffling silence among the crowd so paul said does my mother rule he pointed down to jessica in her black robes of office among them stilgar and all the other troop leaders ask her advice in almost every major decision you know this but does a reverend mother walk the sand or lead a razzia against the harkonnens frowns creased the foreheads of those paul could see but still there were angry murmurs this is a dangerous way to do it jessica thought but she remembered the message cylinder and what it implied and she saw pauls intent go right to the depth of their uncertainty dispose of that and all the rest must follow no man recognizes leadership without the challenge and the combat eh paul asked thats the way someone shouted whats our goal paul asked to unseat rabban the harkonnen beast and remake our world into a place where we may raise our families in happiness amidst an abundance of water is this our goal hard tasks need hard ways someone shouted do you smash your knife before a battle paul demanded i say this as fact not meaning it as boast or challenge there isnt a man here stilgar included who could stand against me in single combat this is stilgars own admission he knows it so do you all again the angry mutters lifted from the crowd many of you have been with me on the practice floor paul said you know this isnt idle boast i say it because its fact known to us all and id be foolish not to see it for myself i began training in these ways earlier than you did and my teachers were tougher than any youve ever seen how else do you think i bested jamis at an age when your boys are still fighting only mock battles hes using the voice well jessica thought but thats not enough with these people theyve good insulation against vocal control he must catch them also with logic so paul said we come to this he lifted the message cylinder removed its scrap of tape this was taken from a harkonnen courier its authenticity is beyond question it is addressed to rabban it tells him that his request for new troops is denied that his spice harvest is far below quota that he must wring more spice from arrakis with the people he has stilgar moved up beside paul how many of you see what this means paul asked stilgar saw it immediately theyre cut off someone shouted paul pushed message and cylinder into his sash from his neck he took a braided shigawire cord and removed a ring from the cord holding the ring aloft this was my fathers ducal signet he said i swore never to wear it again until i was ready to lead my troops over all of arrakis and claim it as my rightful fief he put the ring on his finger clenched his fist utter stillness gripped the cavern who rules here paul asked he raised his fist i rule here i rule on every square inch of arrakis this is my ducal fief whether the emperor says yea or nay he gave it to my father and it comes to me through my father paul lifted himself onto his toes settled back to his heels he studied the crowd feeling their temper almost he thought there are men here who will hold positions of importance on arrakis when i claim those imperial rights which are mine paul said stilgar is one of those men not because i wish to bribe him not out of gratitude though im one of many here who owe him life for life no but because hes wise and strong because he governs this troop by his own intelligence and not just by rules do you think me stupid do you think ill cut off my right arm and leave it bloody on the floor of this cavern just to provide you with a circus paul swept a hard gaze across the throng who is there here to say im not the rightful ruler on arrakis must i prove it by leaving every fremen tribe in the erg without a leader beside paul stilgar stirred looked at him questioningly will i subtract from our strength when we need it most paul asked i am your ruler and i say to you that it is time we stopped killing off our best men and started killing our real enemies the harkonnens in one blurred motion stilgar had his crysknife out and pointed over the heads of the throng long live duke paulmuaddib he shouted a deafening roar filled the cavern echoed and reechoed they were cheering and chanting ya hya chouhada muaddib muaddib muaddib ya hya chouhada jessica translated it to herself long live the fighters of muaddib the scene she and paul and stilgar had cooked up between them had worked as theyd planned the tumult died slowly when silence was restored paul faced stilgar said kneel stilgar stilgar dropped to his knees on the ledge hand me your crysknife paul said stilgar obeyed this was not as we planned it jessica thought repeat after me stilgar paul said and he called up the words of investiture as he had heard his own father use them i stilgar take this knife from the hands of my duke i stilgar take this knife from the hands of my duke stilgar said and accepted the milky blade from paul where my duke commands there shall i place this blade paul said stilgar repeated the words speaking slowly and solemnly remembering the source of the rite jessica blinked back tears shook her head i know the reasons for this she thought i shouldnt let it stir me i dedicate this blade to the cause of my duke and the death of his enemies for as long as our blood shall flow paul said stilgar repeated it after him kiss the blade paul ordered stilgar obeyed then in the fremen manner kissed pauls knife arm at a nod from paul he sheathed the blade got to his feet a sighing whisper of awe passed through the crowd and jessica heard the words the prophecy a bene gesserit shall show the way and a reverend mother shall see it and from farther away she shows us through her son stilgar leads this tribe paul said let no man mistake that he commands with my voice what he tells you it is as though i told you wise jessica thought the tribal commander must lose no face among those who should obey him paul lowered his voice said stilgar i want sandwalkers out this night and cielagos sent to summon a council gathering when youve sent them bring chatt korba and otheym and two other lieutenants of your own choosing bring them to my quarters for battle planning we must have a victory to show the council of leaders when they arrive paul nodded for his mother to accompany him led the way down off the ledge and through the throng toward the central passage and the living chambers that had been prepared there as paul pressed through the crowd hands reached out to touch him voices called out to him my knife goes where stilgar commands it paulmuaddib let us fight soon paulmuaddib let us wet our world with the blood of harkonnens feeling the emotions of the throng jessica sensed the fighting edge of these people they could not be more ready we are taking them at the crest she thought in the inner chamber paul motioned his mother to be seated said wait here and he ducked through the hangings to the side passage it was quiet in the chamber after paul had gone so quiet behind the hangings that not even the faint soughing of the wind pumps that circulated air in the sietch penetrated to where she sat he is going to bring gurney halleck here she thought and she wondered at the strange mingling of emotions that filled her gurney and his music had been a part of so many pleasant times on caladan before the move to arrakis she felt that caladan had happened to some other person in the nearly three years since then she had become another person having to confront gurney forced a reassessment of the changes pauls coffee service the fluted alloy of silver and jasmium that he had inherited from jamis rested on a low table to her right she stared at it thinking of how many hands had touched that metal chani had served paul from it within the month what can his desert woman do for a duke except serve him coffee she asked herself she brings him no power no family paul has only one major chance to ally himself with a powerful great house perhaps even with the imperial family there are marriageable princesses after all and every one of them bene gesserit trained jessica imagined herself leaving the rigors of arrakis for the life of power and security she could know as mother of a royal consort she glanced at the thick hangings that obscured the rock of this cavern cell thinking of how she had come here riding amidst a host of worms the palanquins and pack platforms piled high with necessities for the coming campaign as long as chani lives paul will not see his duty jessica thought she has given him a son and that is enough a sudden longing to see her grandson the child whose likeness carried so much of the grandfathers features so like leto swept through her jessica placed her palms against her cheeks began the ritual breathing that stilled emotion and clarified the mind then bent forward from the waist in the devotional exercise that prepared the body for the minds demands pauls choice of this cave of birds as his command post could not be questioned she knew it was ideal and to the north lay wind pass opening onto a protected village in a cliffwalled sink it was a key village home of artisans and technicians maintenance center for an entire harkonnen defensive sector a cough sounded outside the chamber hangings jessica straightened took a deep breath exhaled slowly enter she said draperies were flung aside and gurney halleck bounded into the room she had only time for a glimpse of his face with its odd grimace then he was behind her lifting her to her feet with one brawny arm beneath her chin gurney you fool what are you doing she demanded then she felt the touch of the knife tip against her back chill awareness spread out from that knife tip she knew in that instant that gurney meant to kill her why she could think of no reason for he wasnt the kind to turn traitor but she felt certain of his intention knowing it her mind churned here was no man to be overcome easily here was a killer wary of the voice wary of every combat stratagem wary of every trick of death and violence here was an instrument she herself had helped train with subtle hints and suggestions you thought you had escaped eh witch gurney snarled before she could turn the question over in her mind or try to answer the curtains parted and paul entered here he is moth paul broke off taking in the tensions of the scene you will stand where you are mlord gurney said what paul shook his head jessica started to speak felt the arm tighten against her throat you will speak only when i permit it witch gurney said i want only one thing from you for your son to hear it and i am prepared to send this knife into your heart by reflex at the first sign of a counter against me your voice will remain in a monotone certain muscles you will not tense or move you will act with the most extreme caution to gain yourself a few more seconds of life and i assure you these are all you have paul took a step forward gurney man what is stop right where you are gurney snapped one more step and shes dead pauls hand slipped to his knife hilt he spoke in a deadly quiet you had best explain yourself gurney i swore an oath to slay the betrayer of your father gurney said do you think i can forget the man who rescued me from a harkonnen slave pit gave me freedom life and honor gave me friendship a thing i prized above all else i have his betrayer under my knife no one can stop me from you couldnt be more wrong gurney paul said and jessica thought so thats it what irony wrong am i gurney demanded let us hear it from the woman herself and let her remember that i have bribed and spied and cheated to confirm this charge ive even pushed semuta on a harkonnen guard captain to get part of the story jessica felt the arm at her throat ease slightly but before she could speak paul said the betrayer was yueh i tell you this once gurney the evidence is complete can not be controverted it was yueh i do not care how you came by your suspicion for it can be nothing else but if you harm my mother paul lifted his crysknife from its scabbard held the blade in front of him ill have your blood yueh was a conditioned medic fit for a royal house gurney snarled he could not turn traitor i know a way to remove that conditioning paul said evidence gurney insisted the evidence is not here paul said its in tabr sietch far to the south but if this is a trick gurney snarled and his arm tightened on jessicas throat no trick gurney paul said and his voice carried such a note of terrible sadness that the sound tore at jessicas heart i saw the message captured from the harkonnen agent gurney said the note pointed directly at i saw it too paul said my father showed it to me the night he explained why it had to be a harkonnen trick aimed at making him suspect the woman he loved ayah gurney said youve not be quiet paul said and the monotone stillness of his words carried more command than jessica had ever heard in another voice he has the great control she thought gurneys arm trembled against her neck the point of the knife at her back moved with uncertainty what you have not done paul said is heard my mother sobbing in the night over her lost duke you have not seen her eyes stab flame when she speaks of killing harkonnens so he has listened she thought tears blinded her eyes what you have not done paul went on is remembered the lessons you learned in a harkonnen slave pit you speak of pride in my fathers friendship didnt you learn the difference between harkonnen and atreides so that you could smell a harkonnen trick by the stink they left on it didnt you learn that atreides loyalty is bought with love while the harkonnen coin is hate couldnt you see through to the very nature of this betrayal but yueh gurney muttered the evidence we have is yuehs own message to us admitting his treachery paul said i swear this to you by the love i hold for you a love i will still hold even after i leave you dead on this floor hearing her son jessica marveled at the awareness in him the penetrating insight of his intelligence my father had an instinct for his friends paul said he gave his love sparingly but with never an error his weakness lay in misunderstanding hatred he thought anyone who hated harkonnens could not betray him he glanced at his mother she knows this ive given her my fathers message that he never distrusted her jessica felt herself losing control bit at her lower lip seeing the stiff formality in paul she realized what these words were costing him she wanted to run to him cradle his head against her breast as she never had done but the arm against her throat had ceased its trembling the knifepoint at her back pressed still and sharp one of the most terrible moments in a boys life paul said is when he discovers his father and mother are human beings who share a love that he can never quite taste its a loss an awakening to the fact that the world is there and here and we are in it alone the moment carries its own truth you cant evade it i heard my father when he spoke of my mother shes not the betrayer gurney jessica found her voice said gurney release me there was no special command in the words no trick to play on his weaknesses but gurneys hand fell away she crossed to paul stood in front of him not touching him paul she said there are other awakenings in this universe i suddenly see how ive used you and twisted you and manipulated you to set you on a course of my choosing a course i had to choose if thats any excuse because of my own training she swallowed past a lump in her throat looked up into her sons eyes paul i want you to do something for me choose the course of happiness your desert woman marry her if thats your wish defy everyone and everything to do this but choose your own course i she broke off stopped by the low sound of muttering behind her gurney she saw pauls eyes directed beyond her turned gurney stood in the same spot but had sheathed his knife pulled the robe away from his breast to expose the slick grayness of an issue stillsuit the type the smugglers traded for among the sietch warrens put your knife right here in my breast gurney muttered i say kill me and have done with it ive besmirched my name ive betrayed my own duke the finest be still paul said gurney stared at him close that robe and stop acting like a fool paul said ive had enough foolishness for one day kill me i say gurney raged you know me better than that paul said how many kinds of an idiot do you think i am must i go through this with every man i need gurney looked at jessica spoke in a forlorn pleading note so unlike him then you my lady please you kill me jessica crossed to him put her hands on his shoulders gurney why do you insist the atreides must kill those they love gently she pulled the spread robe out of his fingers closed and fastened the fabric over his chest gurney spoke brokenly but i you thought you were doing a thing for leto she said and for this i honor you my lady gurney said he dropped his chin to his chest squeezed his eyelids closed against the tears let us think of this as a misunderstanding among old friends she said and paul heard the soothers the adjusting tones in her voice its over and we can be thankful well never again have that sort of misunderstanding between us gurney opened eyes bright with moisture looked down at her the gurney halleck i knew was a man adept with both blade and baliset jessica said it was the man of the baliset i most admired doesnt that gurney halleck remember how i used to enjoy listening by the hour while he played for me do you still have a baliset gurney ive a new one gurney said brought from chusuk a sweet instrument plays like a genuine varota though theres no signature on it i think myself it was made by a student of varotas who he broke off what can i say to you my lady here we prattle about not prattle gurney paul said he crossed to stand beside his mother eye to eye with gurney not prattle but a thing that brings happiness between friends id take it a kindness if youd play for her now battle planning can wait a little while well not be going into the fight till tomorrow at any rate i ill get my baliset gurney said its in the passage he stepped around them and through the hangings paul put a hand on his mothers arm found that she was trembling its over mother he said without turning her head she looked up at him from the corners of her eyes over of course gurneys gurney oh yes she lowered her gaze the hangings rustled as gurney returned with his baliset he began tuning it avoiding their eyes the hangings on the walls dulled the echoes making the instrument sound small and intimate paul led his mother to a cushion seated her there with her back to the thick draperies of the wall he was suddenly struck by how old she seemed to him with the beginnings of desertdried lines in her face the stretching at the corners of her blueveiled eyes shes tired he thought we must find some way to ease her burdens gurney strummed a chord paul glanced at him said ive things that need my attention wait here for me gurney nodded his mind seemed far away as though he dwelled for this moment beneath the open skies of caladan with cloud fleece on the horizon promising rain paul forced himself to turn away let himself out through the heavy hangings over the side passage he heard gurney take up a tune behind him and paused a moment outside the room to listen to the muted music orchards and vineyards and fullbreasted houris and a cup overflowing before me why do i babble of battles and mountains reduced to dust why do i feel these tears heavens stand open and scatter their riches my hands need but gather their wealth why do i think of an ambush and poison in molten cup why do i feel my years loves arms beckon with their naked delights and edens promise of ecstasies why do i remember the scars dream of old transgressions and why do i sleep with fears a robed fedaykin courier appeared from a corner of the passage ahead of paul the man had hood thrown back and fastenings of his stillsuit hanging loose about his neck proof that he had come just now from the open desert paul motioned for him to stop left the hangings of the door and moved down the passage to the courier the man bowed hands clasped in front of him the way he might greet a reverend mother or sayyadina of the rites he said muaddib leaders are beginning to arrive for the council so soon these are the ones stilgar sent for earlier when it was thought he shrugged i see paul glanced back toward the faint sound of the baliset thinking of the old song that his mother favored an odd stretching of happy tune and sad words stilgar will come here soon with others show them where my mother waits i will wait here muaddib the courier said yes yes do that paul pressed past the man toward the depths of the cavern headed for the place that each such cavern had a place near its waterholding basin there would be a small shaihulud in this place a creature no more than nine meters long kept stunted and trapped by surrounding water ditches the maker after emerging from its little maker vector avoided water for the poison it was and the drowning of a maker was the greatest fremen secret because it produced the substance of their union the water of life the poison that could only be changed by a reverend mother the decision had come to paul while he faced the tension of danger to his mother no line of the future he had ever seen carried that moment of peril from gurney halleck the future the graycloudfuture with its feeling that the entire universe rolled toward a boiling nexus hung around him like a phantom world i must see it he thought his body had slowly acquired a certain spice tolerance that made prescient visions fewer and fewer dimmer and dimmer the solution appeared obvious to him i will drown the maker we will see now whether im the kwisatz haderach who can survive the test that the reverend mothers have survived and it came to pass in the third year of the desert war that paulmuaddib lay alone in the cave of birds beneath the kiswa hangings of an inner cell and he lay as one dead caught up in the revelation of the water of life his being translated beyond the boundaries of time by the poison that gives life thus was the prophecy made true that the lisan algaib might be both dead and alive collected legends of arrakis by the princess irulan chani came up out of the habbanya basin in the predawn darkness hearing the thopter that had brought her from the south go whirwhirring off to a hiding place in the vastness around her the escort kept its distance fanning out into the rocks of the ridge to probe for dangers and giving the mate of muaddib the mother of his firstborn the thing she had requested a moment to walk alone why did he summon me she asked herself he told me before that i must remain in the south with little leto and alia she gathered her robe and leaped lightly up across a barrier rock and onto the climbing path that only the deserttrained could recognize in the darkness pebbles slithered underfoot and she danced across them without considering the nimbleness required the climb was exhilarating easing the fears that had fermented in her because of her escorts silent withdrawal and the fact that a precious thopter had been sent for her she felt the inner leaping at the nearness of reunion with paulmuaddib her usul his name might be a battle cry over all the land muaddib muaddib muaddib but she knew a different man by a different name the father of her son the tender lover a great figure loomed out of the rocks above her beckoning for speed she quickened her pace dawn birds already were calling and lifting into the sky a dim spread of light grew across the eastern horizon the figure above was not one of her own escort otheym she wondered marking a familiarity of movement and manner she came up to him recognized in the growing light the broad flat features of the fedaykin lieutenant his hood open and mouth filter loosely fastened the way one did sometimes when venturing out on the desert for only a moment hurry he hissed and led her down the secret crevasse into the hidden cave it will be light soon he whispered as he held a doorseal open for her the harkonnens have been making desperation patrols over some of this region we dare not chance discovery now they emerged into the narrow sidepassage entrance to the cave of birds glowglobes came alight otheym pressed past her said follow me quickly now they sped down the passage through another valve door another passage and through hangings into what had been the sayyadinas alcove in the days when this was an overday rest cave rugs and cushions now covered the floor woven hangings with the red figure of a hawk hid the rock walls a low field desk at one side was strewn with papers from which lifted the aroma of their spice origin the reverend mother sat alone directly opposite the entrance she looked up with the inward stare that made the uninitiated tremble otheym pressed palms together said i have brought chani he bowed retreated through the hangings and jessica thought how do i tell chani how is my grandson jessica asked so its to be the ritual greeting chani thought and her fears returned where is muaddib why isnt he here to greet me he is healthy and happy my mother chani said i left him with alia in the care of harah my mother jessica thought yes she has the right to call me that in the formal greeting she has given me a grandson i hear a gift of cloth has been sent from coanua sietch jessica said it is lovely cloth chani said does alia send a message no message but the sietch moves more smoothly now that the people are beginning to accept the miracle of her status why does she drag this out so chani wondered something was so urgent that they sent a thopter for me now we drag through the formalities we must have some of the new cloth cut into garments for little leto jessica said whatever you wish my mother chani said she lowered her gaze is there news of battles she held her face expressionless that jessica might not see the betrayal that this was a question about paul muaddib new victories jessica said rabban has sent cautious overtures about a truce his messengers have been returned without their water rabban has even lightened the burdens of the people in some of the sink villages but he is too late the people know he does it out of fear of us thus it goes as muaddib said chani said she stared at jessica trying to keep her fears to herself i have spoken his name but she has not responded one can not see emotion in that glazed stone she calls a face but she is too frozen why is she so still what has happened to my usul i wish we were in the south jessica said the oases were so beautiful when we left do you not long for the day when the whole land may blossom thus the land is beautiful true chani said but there is much grief in it grief is the price of victory jessica said is she preparing me for grief chani asked herself she said there are so many women without men there was jealousy when it was learned that id been summoned north i summoned you jessica said chani felt her heart hammering she wanted to clap her hands to her ears fearful of what they might hear still she kept her voice even the message was signed muaddib i signed it thus in the presence of his lieutenants jessica said it was a subterfuge of necessity and jessica thought this is a brave woman my pauls she holds to the niceties even when fear is almost overwhelming her yes she may be the one we need now only the slightest tone of resignation crept into chanis voice as she said now you may say the thing that must be said you were needed here to help me revive paul jessica said and she thought there i said it in the precisely correct way revive thus she knows paul is alive and knows there is peril all in the same word chani took only a moment to calm herself then what is it i may do she wanted to leap at jessica shake her and scream take me to him but she waited silently for the answer i suspect jessica said that the harkonnens have managed to send an agent among us to poison paul its the only explanation that seems to fit a most unusual poison ive examined his blood in the most subtle ways without detecting it chani thrust herself forward onto her knees poison is he in pain could i he is unconscious jessica said the processes of his life are so low that they can be detected only with the most refined techniques i shudder to think what could have happened had i not been the one to discover him he appears dead to the untrained eye you have reasons other than courtesy for summoning me chani said i know you reverend mother what is it you think i may do that you can not do she is brave lovely and ahhh so perceptive jessica thought shed have made a fine bene gesserit chani jessica said you may find this difficult to believe but i do not know precisely why i sent for you it was an instinct a basic intuition the thought came unbidden send for chani for the first time chani saw the sadness in jessicas expression the unveiled pain modifying the inward stare ive done all i know to do jessica said that all it is so far beyond what is usually supposed as all that you would find difficulty imagining it yet i failed the old companion halleck chani asked is it possible hes a traitor not gurney jessica said the two words carried an entire conversation and chani saw the searching the tests the memories of old failures that went into this flat denial chani rocked back onto her feet stood up smoothed her desertstained robe take me to him she said jessica arose turned through hangings on the left wall chani followed found herself in what had been a storeroom its rock walls concealed now beneath heavy draperies paul lay on a field pad against the far wall a single glowglobe above him illuminated his face a black robe covered him to the chest leaving his arms outside it stretched along his sides he appeared to be unclothed under the robe the skin exposed looked waxen rigid there was no visible movement to him chani suppressed the desire to dash forward throw herself across him she found her thoughts instead going to her son leto and she realized in this instant that jessica once had faced such a moment her man threatened by death forced in her own mind to consider what might be done to save a young son the realization formed a sudden bond with the older woman so that chani reached out and clasped jessicas hand the answering grip was painful in its intensity he lives jessica said i assure you he lives but the thread of his life is so thin it could easily escape detection there are some among the leaders already muttering that the mother speaks and not the reverend mother that my son is truly dead and i do not want to give up his water to the tribe how long has he been this way chani asked she disengaged her hand from jessicas moved farther into the room three weeks jessica said i spent almost a week trying to revive him there were meetings arguments investigations then i sent for you the fedaykin obey my orders else i might not have been able to delay the she wet her lips with her tongue watching chani cross to paul chani stood over him now looking down on the soft beard of youth that framed his face tracing with her eyes the high browline the strong nose the shuttered eyes the features so peaceful in this rigid repose how does he take nourishment chani asked the demands of his flesh are so slight he does not yet need food jessica said how many know of what has happened chani asked only his closest advisers a few of the leaders the fedaykin and of course whoever administered the poison there is no clue to the poisoner and its not for want of investigating jessica said what do the fedaykin say chani asked they believe paul is in a sacred trance gathering his holy powers before the final battles this is a thought ive cultivated chani lowered herself to her knees beside the pad bent close to pauls face she sensed an immediate difference in the air about his face but it was only the spice the ubiquitous spice whose odor permeated everything in fremen life still you were not born to the spice as we were chani said have you investigated the possibility that his body has rebelled against too much spice in his diet allergy reactions are all negative jessica said she closed her eyes as much to blot out this scene as because of sudden realization of fatigue how long have i been without sleep she asked herself too long when you change the water of life chani said you do it within yourself by the inward awareness have you used this awareness to test his blood normal fremen blood jessica said completely adapted to the diet and the life here chani sat back on her heels submerging her fears in thought as she studied pauls face this was a trick she had learned from watching the reverend mothers time could be made to serve the mind one concentrated the entire attention presently chani said is there a maker here there are several jessica said with a touch of weariness we are never without them these days each victory requires its blessing each ceremony before a raid but paul muaddib has held himself aloof from these ceremonies chani said jessica nodded to herself remembering her sons ambivalent feelings toward the spice drug and the prescient awareness it precipitated how did you know this jessica asked it is spoken too much is spoken jessica said bitterly get me the raw water of the maker chani said jessica stiffened at the tone of command in chanis voice then observed the intense concentration in the younger woman and said at once she went out through the hangings to send a waterman chani sat staring at paul if he has tried to do this she thought and its the sort of thing he might try jessica knelt beside chani holding out a plain camp ewer the charged odor of the poison was sharp in chanis nostrils she dipped a finger in the fluid held the finger close to pauls nose the skin along the bridge of his nose wrinkled slightly slowly the nostrils flared jessica gasped chani touched the dampened finger to pauls upper lip he drew in a long sobbing breath what is this jessica demanded be still chani said you must convert a small amount of the sacred water quickly without questioning because she recognized the tone of awareness in chanis voice jessica lifted the ewer to her mouth drew in a small sip pauls eyes flew open he stared upward at chani it is not necessary for her to change the water he said his voice was weak but steady jessica a sip of the fluid on her tongue found her body rallying converting the poison almost automatically in the light elevation the ceremony always imparted she sensed the lifeglow from paul a radiation there registering on her senses in that instant she knew you drank the sacred water she blurted one drop of it paul said so small one drop how could you do such a foolish thing she demanded he is your son chani said jessica glared at her a rare smile warm and full of understanding touched pauls lips hear my beloved he said listen to her mother she knows a thing that others can do he must do chani said when i had the drop in my mouth when i felt it and smelled it when i knew what it was doing to me then i knew i could do the thing that you have done he said your bene gesserit proctors speak of the kwisatz haderach but they can not begin to guess the many places i have been in the few minutes i he broke off looking at chani with a puzzled frown chani how did you get here youre supposed to be why are you here he tried to push himself onto his elbows chani pressed him back gently please my usul she said i feel so weak he said his gaze darted around the room how long have i been here youve been three weeks in a coma so deep that the spark of life seemed to have fled jessica said but it was i took it just a moment ago and a moment for you three weeks of fear for me jessica said it was only one drop but i converted it paul said i changed the water of life and before chani or jessica could stop him he dipped his hand into the ewer they had placed on the floor beside him and he brought the dripping hand to his mouth swallowed the palmcupped liquid paul jessica screamed he grabbed her hand faced her with a deaths head grin and he sent his awareness surging over her the rapport was not as tender not as sharing not as encompassing as it had been with alia and with the old reverend mother in the cavern but it was a rapport a sensesharing of the entire being it shook her weakened her and she cowered in her mind fearful of him aloud he said you speak of a place where you can not enter this place which the reverend mother can not face show it to me she shook her head terrified by the very thought show it to me he commanded no but she could not escape him bludgeoned by the terrible force of him she closed her eyes and focused inward thedirectionthatisdark pauls consciousness flowed through and around her and into the darkness she glimpsed the place dimly before her mind blanked itself away from the terror without knowing why her whole being trembled at what she had seen a region where a wind blew and sparks glared where rings of light expanded and contracted where rows of tumescent white shapes flowed over and under and around the lights driven by darkness and a wind out of nowhere presently she opened her eyes saw paul staring up at her he still held her hand but the terrible rapport was gone she quieted her trembling paul released her hand it was as though some crutch had been removed she staggered up and back would have fallen had not chani jumped to support her reverend mother chani said what is wrong tired jessica whispered so tired here chani said sit here she helped jessica to a cushion against the wall the strong young arms felt so good to jessica she clung to chani he has in truth seen the water of life chani asked she disengaged herself from jessicas grip he has seen jessica whispered her mind still rolled and surged from the contact it was like stepping to solid land after weeks on a heaving sea she sensed the old reverend mother within her and all the others awakened and questioning what was that what happened where was that place through it all threaded the realization that her son was the kwisatz haderach the one who could be many places at once he was the fact out of the bene gesserit dream and the fact gave her no peace what happened chani demanded jessica shook her head paul said there is in each of us an ancient force that takes and an ancient force that gives a man finds little difficulty facing that place within himself where the taking force dwells but its almost impossible for him to see into the giving force without changing into something other than man for a woman the situation is reversed jessica looked up found chani was staring at her while listening to paul do you understand me mother paul asked she could only nod these things are so ancient within us paul said that theyre ground into each separate cell of our bodies were shaped by such forces you can say to yourself yes i see how such a thing may be but when you look inward and confront the raw force of your own life unshielded you see your peril you see that this could overwhelm you the greatest peril to the giver is the force that takes the greatest peril to the taker is the force that gives its as easy to be overwhelmed by giving as by taking and you my son jessica asked are you one who gives or one who takes im at the fulcrum he said i can not give without taking and i can not take without he broke off looking to the wall at his right chani felt a draft against her cheek turned to see the hangings close it was otheym paul said he was listening accepting the words chani was touched by some of the prescience that haunted paul and she knew a thingyettobe as though it already had occurred otheym would speak of what he had seen and heard others would spread the story until it was a fire over the land paulmuaddib is not as other men they would say there can be no more doubt he is a man yet he sees through to the water of life in the way of a reverend mother he is indeed the lisan algaib you have seen the future paul jessica said will you say what youve seen not the future he said ive seen the now he forced himself to a sitting position waved chani aside as she moved to help him the space above arrakis is filled with the ships of the guild jessica trembled at the certainty in his voice the padishah emperor himself is there paul said he looked at the rock ceiling of his cell with his favorite truthsayer and five legions of sardaukar the old baron vladimir harkonnen is there with thufir hawat beside him and seven ships jammed with every conscript he could muster every great house has its raiders above us waiting chani shook her head unable to look away from paul his strangeness the flat tone of voice the way he looked through her filled her with awe jessica tried to swallow in a dry throat said for what are they waiting paul looked at her for the guilds permission to land the guild will strand on arrakis any force that lands without permission the guilds protecting us jessica asked protecting us the guild itself caused this by spreading tales about what we do here and by reducing troop transport fares to a point where even the poorest houses are up there now waiting to loot us jessica noted the lack of bitterness in his tone wondered at it she couldnt doubt his words they had that same intensity shed seen in him the night hed revealed the path of the future thatd taken them among the fremen paul took a deep breath said mother you must change a quantity of the water for us we need the catalyst chani have a scout force sent out to find a prespice mass if we plant a quantity of the water of life above a prespice mass do you know what will happen jessica weighed his words suddenly saw through to his meaning paul she gasped the water of death he said itd be a chain reaction he pointed to the floor spreading death among the little makers killing a vector of the life cycle that includes the spice and the makers arrakis will become a true desolation without spice or maker chani put a hand to her mouth shocked to numb silence by the blasphemy pouring from pauls lips he who can destroy a thing has the real control of it paul said we can destroy the spice what stays the guilds hand jessica whispered theyre searching for me paul said think of that the finest guild navigators men who can quest ahead through time to find the safest course for the fastest heighliners all of them seeking me and unable to find me how they tremble they know i have their secret here paul held out his cupped hand without the spice theyre blind chani found her voice you said you see the now paul lay back searching the spreadout present its limits extended into the future and into the past holding onto the awareness with difficulty as the spice illumination began to fade go do as i commanded he said the futures becoming as muddled for the guild as it is for me the lines of vision are narrowing everything focuses here where the spice is where theyve dared not interfere before because to interfere was to lose what they must have but now theyre desperate all paths lead into darkness and that day dawned when arrakis lay at the hub of the universe with the wheel poised to spin from arrakis awakening by the princess irulan will you look at that thing stilgar whispered paul lay beside him in a slit of rock high on the shield wall rim eye fixed to the collector of a fremen telescope the oil lens was focused on a starship lighter exposed by dawn in the basin below them the tall eastern face of the ship glistened in the flat light of the sun but the shadow side still showed yellow portholes from glowglobes of the night beyond the ship the city of arrakeen lay cold and gleaming in the light of the northern sun it wasnt the lighter that excited stilgars awe paul knew but the construction for which the lighter was only the centerpost a single metal hutment many stories tall reached out in a thousandmeter circle from the base of the lighter a tent composed of interlocking metal leaves the temporary lodging place for five legions of sardaukar and his imperial majesty the padishah emperor shaddam iv from his position squatting at pauls left gurney halleck said i count nine levels to it must be quite a few sardaukar in there five legions paul said it grows light stilgar hissed we like it not your exposing yourself muaddib let us go back into the rocks now im perfectly safe here paul said that ship mounts projectile weapons gurney said they believe us protected by shields paul said they wouldnt waste a shot on an unidentified trio even if they saw us paul swung the telescope to scan the far wall of the basin seeing the pockmarked cliffs the slides that marked the tombs of so many of his fathers troopers and he had a momentary sense of the fitness of things that the shades of those men should look down on this moment the harkonnen forts and towns across the shielded lands lay in fremen hands or cut away from their source like stalks severed from a plant and left to wither only this basin and its city remained to the enemy they might try a sortie by thopter stilgar said if they see us let them paul said weve thopters to burn today and we know a storm is coming he swung the telescope to the far side of the arrakeen landing field now to the harkonnen frigates lined up there with a choam company banner waving gently from its staff on the ground beneath them and he thought of the desperation that had forced the guild to permit these two groups to land while all the others were held in reserve the guild was like a man testing the sand with his toe to gauge its temperature before erecting a tent is there anything new to see from here gurney asked we should be getting under cover the storm is coming paul returned his attention on the giant hutment theyve even brought their women he said and lackeys and servants ahhh my dear emperor how confident you are men are coming up the secret way stilgar said it may be otheym and korba returning all right stil paul said well go back but he took one final look around through the telescope studying the plain with its tall ships the gleaming metal hutment the silent city the frigates of the harkonnen mercenaries then he slid backward around a scarp of rock his place at the telescope was taken by a fedaykin guardsman paul emerged into a shallow depression in the shield walls surface it was a place about thirty meters in diameter and some three meters deep a natural feature of the rock that the fremen had hidden beneath a translucent camouflage cover communications equipment was clustered around a hole in the wall to the right fedaykin guards deployed through the depression waited for muaddibs command to attack two men emerged from the hole by the communications equipment spoke to the guards there paul glanced at stilgar nodded in the direction of the two men get their report stil stilgar moved to obey paul crouched with his back to the rock stretching his muscles straightened he saw stilgar sending the two men back into that dark hole in the rock thought about the long climb down that narrow manmade tunnel to the floor of the basin stilgar crossed to paul what was so important that they couldnt send a cielago with the message paul asked theyre saving their birds for the battle stilgar said he glanced at the communications equipment back to paul even with a tight beam it is wrong to use those things muaddib they can find you by taking a bearing on its emission theyll soon be too busy to find me paul said what did the men report our pet sardaukar have been released near old gap low on the rim and are on their way to their master the rocket launchers and other projectile weapons are in place the people are deployed as you ordered it was all routine paul glanced across the shallow bowl studying his men in the filtered light admitted by the camouflage cover he felt time creeping like an insect working its way across an exposed rock itll take our sardaukar a little time afoot before they can signal a troop carrier paul said they are being watched they are being watched stilgar said beside paul gurney halleck cleared his throat hadnt we best be getting to a place of safety there is no such place paul said is the weather report still favorable a great grandmother of a storm coming stilgar said can you not feel it muaddib the air does feel chancy paul agreed but i like the certainty of poling the weather the stormll be here in the hour stilgar said he nodded toward the gap that looked out on the emperors hutment and the harkonnen frigates they know it there too not a thopter in the sky everything pulled in and tied down theyve had a report on the weather from their friends in space any more probing sorties paul asked nothing since the landing last night stilgar said they know were here i think now they wait to choose their own time we choose the time paul said gurney glanced upward growled if they let us that fleetll stay in space paul said gurney shook his head they have no choice paul said we can destroy the spice the guild dares not risk that desperate people are the most dangerous gurney said are we not desperate stilgar asked gurney scowled at him you havent lived with the fremen dream paul cautioned stil is thinking of all the water weve spent on bribes the years of waiting weve added before arrakis can bloom hes not arrrgh gurney scowled whys he so gloomy stilgar asked hes always gloomy before a battle paul said its the only form of good humor gurney allows himself a slow wolfish grin spread across gurneys face the teeth showing white above the chip cup of his stillsuit it glooms me much to think on all the poor harkonnen souls well dispatch unshriven he said stilgar chuckled he talks like a fedaykin gurney was born a death commando paul said and he thought yes let them occupy their minds with small talk be fore we test ourselves against that force on the plain he looked to the gap in the rock wall and back to gurney found that the troubadourwarrior had resumed a brooding scowl worry saps the strength paul murmured you told me that once gurney my duke gurney said my chief worry is the atomics if you use them to blast a hole in the shield wall those people up there wont use atomics against us paul said they dont dare and for the same reason that they can not risk our destroying the source of the spice but the injunction against the injunction paul barked its fear not the injunction that keeps the houses from hurling atomics against each other the language of the great convention is clear enough use of atomics against humans shall be cause for planetary obliteration were going to blast the shield wall not humans its too fine a point gurney said the hairsplitters up there will welcome any point paul said lets talk no more about it he turned away wishing he actually felt that confident presently he said what about the city people are they in position yet yes stilgar muttered paul looked at him whats eating you i never knew the city man could be trusted completely stilgar said i was a city man myself once paul said stilgar stiffened his face grew dark with blood muaddib knows i did not mean i know what you meant stil but the test of a man isnt what you think hell do its what he actually does these city people have fremen blood its just that they havent yet learned how to escape their bondage well teach them stilgar nodded spoke in a rueful tone the habits of a lifetime muaddib on the funeral plain we learned to despise the men of the communities paul glanced at gurney saw him studying stilgar tell us gurney why were the city folk down there driven from their homes by the sardaukar an old trick my duke they thought to burden us with refugees its been so long since guerrillas were effective that the mighty have forgotten how to fight them paul said the sardaukar have played into our hands they grabbed some city women for their sport decorated their battle standards with the heads of the men who objected and theyve built up a fever of hate among people who otherwise wouldve looked on the coming battle as no more than a great inconvenience and the possibility of exchanging one set of masters for another the sardaukar recruit for us stilgar the city people do seem eager stilgar said their hate is fresh and clear paul said thats why we use them as shock troops the slaughter among them will be fearful gurney said stilgar nodded agreement they were told the odds paul said they know every sardaukar they kill will be one less for us you see gentlemen they have something to die for theyve discovered theyre a people theyre awakening a muttered exclamation came from the watcher at the telescope paul moved to the rock slit asked what is it out there a great commotion muaddib the watcher hissed at that monstrous metal tent a surface car came from rimwall west and it was like a hawk into a nest of rock partridge our captive sardaukar have arrived paul said theyve a shield around the entire landing field now the watcher said i can see the air dancing even to the edge of the storage yard where they kept the spice now they know who it is they fight gurney said let the harkonnen beasts tremble and fret themselves that an atreides yet lives paul spoke to the fedaykin at the telescope watch the flagpole atop the emperors ship if my flag is raised there it will not be gurney said paul saw the puzzled frown on stilgars face said if the emperor recognized my claim hell signal by restoring the atreides flag to arrakis well use the second plan then move only against the harkonnens the sardaukar will stand aside and let us settle the issue between ourselves ive no experience with these offworld things stilgar said ive heard of them but it seems unlikely the you dont need experience to know what theyll do gurney said theyre sending a new flag up on the tall ship the watcher said the flag is yellow with a black and red circle in the center theres a subtle piece of business paul said the choam company flag its the same as the flag at the other ships the fedaykin guard said i dont understand stilgar said a subtle piece of business indeed gurney said had he sent up the atreides banner hed have had to live by what that meant too many observers about he couldve signaled with the harkonnen flag on his staff a flat declaration thatd have been but no he sends up the choam rag hes telling the people up there gurney pointed toward space where the profit is hes saying he doesnt care if its an atreides here or not how long till the storm strikes the shield wall paul asked stilgar turned away consulted one of the fedaykin in the bowl presently he returned said very soon muaddib sooner than we expected its a greatgreatgrandmother of a storm perhaps even more than you wished its my storm paul said and saw the silent awe on the faces of the fedaykin who heard him though it shook the entire world it could not be more than i wished will it strike the shield wall full on close enough to make no difference stilgar said a courier crossed from the hole that led down into the basin said the sardaukar and harkonnen patrols are pulling back muaddib they expect the storm to spill too much sand into the basin for good visibility stilgar said they think well be in the same fix tell our gunners to set their sights well before visibility drops paul said they must knock the nose off every one of those ships as soon as the storm has destroyed the shields he stepped to the wall of the bowl pulled back a fold of the camouflage cover and looked up at the sky the horsetail twistings of blow sand could be seen against the dark of the sky paul restored the cover said start sending our men down stil will you not go with us stilgar asked ill wait here a bit with the fedaykin paul said stilgar gave a knowing shrug toward gurney moved to the hole in the rock wall was lost in its shadows the trigger that blasts the shield wall aside that i leave in your hands gurney paul said you will do it ill do it paul gestured to a fedaykin lieutenant said otheym start moving the check patrols out of the blast area they must be out of there before the storm strikes the man bowed followed stilgar gurney leaned in to the rock slit spoke to the man at the telescope keep your attention on the south wall itll be completely undefended until we blow it dispatch a cielago with a time signal paul ordered some ground cars are moving toward the south wall the man at the telescope said some are using projectile weapons testing our people are using body shields as you commanded the ground cars have stopped in the abrupt silence paul heard the wind devils playing overhead the front of the storm sand began to drift down into their bowl through gaps in the cover a burst of wind caught the cover whipped it away paul motioned his fedaykin to take shelter crossed to the men at the communications equipment near the tunnel mouth gurney stayed beside him paul crouched over the signalmen one said a greatgreatgreat grandmother of a storm muaddib paul glanced up at the darkening sky said gurney have the south wall observers pulled out he had to repeat his order shouting above the growing noise of the storm gurney turned to obey paul fastened his face filter tightened the stillsuit hood gurney returned paul touched his shoulder pointed to the blast trigger set into the tunnel mouth beyond the signalmen gurney went into the tunnel stopped there one hand at the trigger his gaze on paul we are getting no messages the signalman beside paul said much static paul nodded kept his eye on the timestandard dial in front of the signalman presently paul looked at gurney raised a hand returned his attention to the dial the time counter crawled around its final circuit now paul shouted and dropped his hand gurney depressed the blast trigger it seemed that a full second passed before they felt the ground beneath them ripple and shake a rumbling sound was added to the storms roar the fedaykin watcher from the telescope appeared beside paul the telescope clutched under one arm the shield wall is breached muaddib he shouted the storm is on them and our gunners already are firing paul thought of the storm sweeping across the basin the static charge within the wall of sand that destroyed every shield barrier in the enemy camp the storm someone shouted we must get under cover muaddib paul came to his senses feeling the sand needles sting his exposed cheeks we are committed he thought he put an arm around the signalmans shoulder said leave the equipment theres more in the tunnel he felt himself being pulled away fedaykin pressed around him to protect him they squeezed into the tunnel mouth feeling its comparative silence turned a corner into a small chamber with glowglobes overhead and another tunnel opening beyond another signalman sat there at his equipment much static the man said a swirl of sand filled the air around them seal off this tunnel paul shouted a sudden pressure of stillness showed that his command had been obeyed is the way down to the basin still open paul asked a fedaykin went to look returned said the explosion caused a little rock to fall but the engineers say it is still open theyre cleaning up with lasbeams tell them to use their hands paul barked there are shields active down there they are being careful muaddib the man said but he turned to obey the signalmen from outside pressed past them carrying their equipment i told those men to leave their equipment paul said fremen do not like to abandon equipment muaddib one of his fedaykin chided men are more important than equipment now paul said well have more equipment than we can use soon or have no need for any equipment gurney halleck came up beside him said i heard them say the way down is open were very close to the surface here mlord should the harkonnens try to retaliate in kind theyre in no position to retaliate paul said theyre just now finding out that they have no shields and are unable to get off arrakis the new command post is all prepared though mlord gurney said theyve no need of me in the command post yet paul said the plan would go ahead without me we must wait for the im getting a message muaddib said the signalman at the communications equipment the man shook his head pressed a receiver phone against his ear much static he began scribbling on a pad in front of him shaking his head waiting writing waiting paul crossed to the signalmans side the fedaykin stepped back giving him room he looked down at what the man had written read raid on sietch tabr captives alia blank families of blank dead are they blank son of muaddib again the signalman shook his head paul looked up to see gurney staring at him the message is garbled gurney said the static you dont know that my son is dead paul said and knew as he spoke that it was true my son is dead and alia is a captive hostage he felt emptied a shell without emotions everything he touched brought death and grief and it was like a disease that could spread across the universe he could feel the oldman wisdom the accumulation out of the experiences from countless possible lives something seemed to chuckle and rub its hands within him and paul thought how little the universe knows about the nature of real cruelty and muaddib stood before them and he said though we deem the captive dead yet does she live for her seed is my seed and her voice is my voice and she sees unto the farthest reaches of possibility yea unto the vale of the unknowable does she see because of me from arrakis awakening by the princess irulan the baron vladimir harkonnen stood with eyes downcast in the imperial audience chamber the oval selamlik within the padishah emperors hutment with covert glances the baron had studied the metalwalled room and its occupants the noukkers the pages the guards the troop of house sardaukar drawn up around the walls standing at ease there beneath the bloody and tattered captured battle flags that were the rooms only decoration voices sounded from the right of the chamber echoing out of a high passage make way make way for the royal person the padishah emperor shaddam iv came out of the passage into the audience chamber followed by his suite he stood waiting while his throne was brought ignoring the baron seemingly ignoring every person in the room the baron found that he could not ignore the royal person and studied the emperor for a sign any clue to the purpose of this audience the emperor stood poised waiting a slim elegant figure in a gray sardaukar uniform with silver and gold trim his thin face and cold eyes reminded the baron of the duke leto long dead there was that same look of the predatory bird but the emperors hair was red not black and most of that hair was concealed by a bursegs ebon helmet with the imperial crest in gold upon its crown pages brought the throne it was a massive chair carved from a single piece of hagal quartz bluegreen translucency shot through with streaks of yellow fire they placed it on the dais and the emperor mounted seated himself an old woman in a black aba robe with hood drawn down over her forehead detached herself from the emperors suite took up station behind the throne one scrawny hand resting on the quartz back her face peered out of the hood like a witch caricature sunken cheeks and eyes an overlong nose skin mottled and with protruding veins the baron stilled his trembling at sight of her the presence of the reverend mother gains helen mohiam the emperors truthsayer betrayed the importance of this audience the baron looked away from her studied the suite for a clue there were two of the guild agents one tall and fat one short and fat both with bland gray eyes and among the lackeys stood one of the emperors daughters the princess irulan a woman they said was being trained in the deepest of the bene gesserit ways destined to be a reverend mother she was tall blonde face of chiseled beauty green eyes that looked past and through him my dear baron the emperor had deigned to notice him the voice was baritone and with exquisite control it managed to dismiss him while greeting him the baron bowed low advanced to the required position ten paces from the dais i came at your summons majesty summons the old witch cackled now reverend mother the emperor chided but he smiled at the barons discomfiture said first you will tell me where youve sent your minion thufir hawat the baron darted his gaze left and right reviled himself for coming here without his own guards not that theyd be much use against sardaukar still well the emperor said he has been gone these five days majesty the baron shot a glance at the guild agents back to the emperor he was to land at a smuggler base and attempt infiltrating the camp of the fremen fanatic this muaddib incredible the emperor said one of the witchs clawlike hands tapped the emperors shoulder she leaned forward whispered in his ear the emperor nodded said five days baron tell me why arent you worried about his absence but i am worried majesty the emperor continued to stare at him waiting the reverend mother emitted a cackling laugh what i mean majesty the baron said is that hawat will be dead within another few hours anyway and he explained about the latent poison and need for an antidote how clever of you baron the emperor said and where are your nephews rabban and the young feydrautha the storm comes majesty i sent them to inspect our perimeter lest the fremen attack under cover of the sand perimeter the emperor said the word came out as though it puckered his mouth the storm wont be much here in the basin and that fremen rabble wont attack while im here with five legions of sardaukar surely not majesty the baron said but error on the side of caution can not be censured ahhhh the emperor said censure then im not to speak of how much time this arrakis nonsense has taken from me nor the choam company profits pouring down this rat hole nor the court functions and affairs of state ive had to delay even cancel because of this stupid affair the baron lowered his gaze frightened by the imperial anger the delicacy of his position here alone and dependent upon the convention and the dictum familia of the great houses fretted him does he mean to kill me the baron asked himself he couldnt not with the other great houses waiting up there aching for any excuse to gain from this upset on arrakis have you taken hostages the emperor asked its useless majesty the baron said these mad fremen hold a burial ceremony for every captive and act as though such a one were already dead so the emperor said and the baron waited glancing left and right at the metal walls of the selamlik thinking of the monstrous fanmetal tent around him such unlimited wealth it represented that even the baron was awed he brings pages the baron thought and useless court lackeys his women and their companions hairdressers designers everything all the fringe parasites of the court all here fawning slyly plotting roughing it with the emperor here to watch him put an end to this affair to make epigrams over the battles and idolize the wounded perhaps youve never sought the right kind of hostages the emperor said he knows something the baron thought fear sat like a stone in his stomach until he could hardly bear the thought of eating yet the feeling was like hunger and he poised himself several times in his suspensors on the point of ordering food brought to him but there was no one here to obey his summons do you have any idea who this muaddib could be the emperor asked one of the umma surely the baron said a fremen fanatic a religious adventurer they crop up regularly on the fringes of civilization your majesty knows this the emperor glanced at his truthsayer turned back to scowl at the baron and you have no other knowledge of this muaddib a madman the baron said but all fremen are a little mad mad his people scream his name as they leap into battle the women throw their babies at us and hurl themselves onto our knives to open a wedge for their men to attack us they have no no decency as bad as that the emperor murmured and his tone of derision did not escape the baron tell me my dear baron have you investigated the southern polar regions of arrakis the baron stared up at the emperor shocked by the change of subject but well you know your majesty the entire region is uninhabitable open to wind and worm theres not even any spice in those latitudes youve had no reports from spice lighters that patches of greenery appear there thereve always been such reports some were investigated long ago a few plants were seen many thopters were lost much too costly your majesty its a place where men can not survive for long so the emperor said he snapped his fingers and a door opened at his left behind the throne through the door came two sardaukar herding a girlchild who appeared to be about four years old she wore a black aba the hood thrown back to reveal the attachments of a stillsuit hanging free at her throat her eyes were fremen blue staring out of a soft round face she appeared completely unafraid and there was a look to her stare that made the baron feel uneasy for no reason he could explain even the old bene gesserit truthsayer drew back as the child passed and made a warding sign in her direction the old witch obviously was shaken by the childs presence the emperor cleared his throat to speak but the child spoke first a thin voice with traces of a softpalate lisp but clear nonetheless so here he is she said she advanced to the edge of the dais he doesnt appear much does he one frightened old fat man too weak to support his own flesh without the help of suspensors it was such a totally unexpected statement from the mouth of a child that the baron stared at her speechless in spite of his anger is it a midget he asked himself my dear baron the emperor said become acquainted with the sister of muaddib the sist the baron shifted his attention to the emperor i do not understand i too sometimes err on the side of caution the emperor said it has been reported to me that your uninhabited south polar regions exhibit evidence of human activity but thats impossible the baron protested the worms theres sand clear to the these people seem able to avoid the worms the emperor said the child sat down on the dais beside the throne dangled her feet over the edge kicking them there was such an air of sureness in the way she appraised her surroundings the baron stared at the kicking feet the way they moved the black robe the wink of sandals beneath the fabric unfortunately the emperor said i only sent in five troop carriers with a light attack force to pick up prisoners for questioning we barely got away with three prisoners and one carrier mind you baron my sardaukar were almost overwhelmed by a force composed mostly of women children and old men this child here was in command of one of the attacking groups you see your majesty the baron said you see how they are i allowed myself to be captured the child said i did not want to face my brother and have to tell him that his son had been killed only a handful of our men got away the emperor said got away you hear that wed have had them too the child said except for the flames my sardaukar used the attitudinal jets on their carrier as flamethrowers the emperor said a move of desperation and the only thing that got them away with their three prisoners mark that my dear baron sardaukar forced to retreat in confusion from women and children and old men we must attack in force the baron rasped we must destroy every last vestige of silence the emperor roared he pushed himself forward on his throne do not abuse my intelligence any longer you stand there in your foolish innocence and majesty the old truthsayer said he waved her to silence you say you dont know about the activity we found nor the fighting qualities of these superb people the emperor lifted himself half off his throne what do you take me for baron the baron took two backward steps thinking it was rabban he has done this to me rabban has and this fake dispute with duke leto the emperor purred sinking back into his throne how beautifully you maneuvered it majesty the baron pleaded what are you silence the old bene gesserit put a hand on the emperors shoulder leaned close to whisper in his ear the child seated on the dais stopped kicking her feet said make him afraid some more shaddam i shouldnt enjoy this but i find the pleasure impossible to suppress quiet child the emperor said he leaned forward put a hand on her head stared at the baron is it possible baron could you be as simpleminded as my truthsayer suggests do you not recognize this child daughter of your ally duke leto my father was never his ally the child said my father is dead and this old harkonnen beast has never seen me before the baron was reduced to stupefied glaring when he found his voice it was only to rasp who i am alia daughter of duke leto and the lady jessica sister of duke paulmuaddib the child said she pushed herself off the dais dropped to the floor of the audience chamber my brother has promised to have your head atop his battle standard and i think he shall be hush child the emperor said and he sank back into his throne hand to chin studying the baron i do not take the emperors orders alia said she turned looked up at the old reverend mother she knows the emperor glanced up at his truthsayer what does she mean that child is an abomination the old woman said her mother deserves a punishment greater than anything in history death it can not come too quickly for that child or for the one who spawned her the old woman pointed a finger at alia get out of my mind tp the emperor whispered he snapped his attention back to alia by the great mother you dont understand majesty the old woman said not telepathy shes in my mind shes like the ones before me the ones who gave me their memories she stands in my mind she can not be there but she is what others the emperor demanded whats this nonsense the old woman straightened lowered her pointing hand ive said too much but the fact remains that this child who is not a child must be destroyed long were we warned against such a one and how to prevent such a birth but one of our own has betrayed us you babble old woman alia said you dont know how it was yet you rattle on like a purblind fool alia closed her eyes took a deep breath and held it the old reverend mother groaned and staggered alia opened her eyes that is how it was she said a cosmic accident and you played your part in it the reverend mother held out both hands palms pushing the air toward alia what is happening here the emperor demanded child can you truly project your thoughts into the mind of another thats not how it is at all alia said unless im born as you i can not think as you kill her the old woman muttered and clutched the back of the throne for support kill her the sunken old eyes glared at alia silence the emperor said and he studied alia child can you communicate with your brother my brother knows im here alia said can you tell him to surrender as the price of your life alia smiled up at him with clear innocence i shall not do that she said the baron stumbled forward to stand beside alia majesty he pleaded i knew nothing of interrupt me once more baron the emperor said and you will lose the powers of interruption forever he kept his attention focused on alia studying her through slitted lids you will not eh can you read in my mind what ill do if you disobey me ive already said i can not read minds she said but one doesnt need telepathy to read your intentions the emperor scowled child your cause is hopeless i have but to rally my forces and reduce this planet to its not that simple alia said she looked at the two guildsmen ask them it is not wise to go against my desires the emperor said you should not deny me the least thing my brother comes now alia said even an emperor may tremble before muaddib for he has the strength of righteousness and heaven smiles upon him the emperor surged to his feet this play has gone far enough i will take your brother and this planet and grind them to the room rumbled and shook around them there came a sudden cascade of sand behind the throne where the hutment was coupled to the emperors ship the abrupt flickertightening of skin pressure told of a widearea shield being activated i told you alia said my brother comes the emperor stood in front of his throne right hand pressed to right ear the servoreceiver there chattering its report on the situation the baron moved two steps behind alia sardaukar were leaping to positions at the doors we will fall back into space and reform the emperor said baron my apologies these madmen are attacking under cover of the storm we will show them an emperors wrath then he pointed at alia give her body to the storm as he spoke alia fled backward feigning terror let the storm have what it can take she screamed and she backed into the barons arms i have her majesty the baron shouted shall i dispatch her noweeeeeeeeeeeh he hurled her to the floor clutched his left arm im sorry grandfather alia said youve met the atreides gom jabbar she got to her feet dropped a dark needle from her hand the baron fell back his eyes bulged as he stared at a red slash on his left palm you you he rolled sideways in his suspensors a sagging mass of flesh supported inches off the floor with head lolling and mouth hanging open these people are insane the emperor snarled quick into the ship well purge this planet of every something sparkled to his left a roll of ball lightning bounced away from the wall there crackled as it touched the metal floor the smell of burned insulation swept through the selamlik the shield one of the sardaukar officers shouted the outer shield is down they his words were drowned in a metallic roaring as the shipwall behind the emperor trembled and rocked theyve shot the nose off our ship someone called dust boiled through the room under its cover alia leaped up ran toward the outer door the emperor whirled motioned his people into an emergency door that swung open in the ships side behind the throne he flashed a hand signal to a sardaukar officer leaping through the dust haze we will make our stand here the emperor ordered another crash shook the hutment the double doors banged open at the far side of the chamber admitting windblown sand and the sound of shouting a small blackrobed figure could be seen momentarily against the light alia darting out to find a knife and as befitted her fremen training to kill harkonnen and sardaukar wounded house sardaukar charged through a greened yellow haze toward the opening weapons ready forming an arc there to protect the emperors retreat save yourself sire a sardaukar officer shouted into the ship but the emperor stood alone now on his dais pointing toward the doors a fortymeter section of the hutment had been blasted away there and the selamliks doors opened now onto drifting sand a dust cloud hung low over the outside world blowing from pastel distances static lightning crackled from the cloud and the spark flashes of shields being shorted out by the storms charge could be seen through the haze the plain surged with figures in combat sardaukar and leaping gyrating robed men who seemed to come down out of the storm all this was as a frame for the target of the emperors pointing hand out of the sand haze came an orderly mass of flashing shapes great rising curves with crystal spokes that resolved into the gaping mouths of sandworms a massed wall of them each with troops of fremen riding to the attack they came in a hissing wedge robes whipping in the wind as they cut through the melee on the plain onward toward the emperors hutment they came while the house sardaukar stood awed for the first time in their history by an onslaught their minds found difficult to accept but the figures leaping from the worm backs were men and the blades flashing in that ominous yellow light were a thing the sardaukar had been trained to face they threw themselves into combat and it was man to man on the plain of arrakeen while a picked sardaukar bodyguard pressed the emperor back into the ship sealed the door on him and prepared to die at that door as part of his shield in the shock of comparative silence within the ship the emperor stared at the wideeyed faces of his suite seeing his oldest daughter with the flush of exertion on her cheeks the old truthsayer standing like a black shadow with her hood pulled about her face finding at last the faces he sought the two guildsmen they wore the guild gray unadorned and it seemed to fit the calm they maintained despite the high emotions around them the taller of the two though held a hand to his left eye as the emperor watched someone jostled the guildsmans arm the hand moved and the eye was revealed the man had lost one of his masking contact lenses and the eye stared out a total blue so dark as to be almost black the smaller of the pair elbowed his way a step nearer the emperor said we can not know how it will go and the taller companion hand restored to eye added in a cold voice but this muaddib can not know either the words shocked the emperor out of his daze he checked the scorn on his tongue by a visible effort because it did not take a guild navigators singleminded focus on the main chance to see the immediate future out on that plain were these two so dependent upon their faculty that they had lost the use of their eyes and their reason he wondered reverend mother he said we must devise a plan she pulled the hood from her face met his gaze with an unblinking stare the look that passed between them carried complete understanding they had one weapon left and both knew it treachery summon count fenring from his quarters the reverend mother said the padishah emperor nodded waved for one of his aides to obey that command he was warrior and mystic ogre and saint the fox and the innocent chivalrous ruthless less than a god more than a man there is no measuring muaddibs motives by ordinary standards in the moment of his triumph he saw the death prepared for him yet he accepted the treachery can you say he did this out of a sense of justice whose justice then remember we speak now of the muaddib who ordered battle drums made from his enemies skins the muaddib who denied the conventions of his ducal past with a wave of the hand saying merely i am the kwisatz haderach that is reason enough from arrakis awakening by the princess irulan it was to the arrakeen governors mansion the old residency the atreides had first occupied on dune that they escorted paulmuaddib on the evening of his victory the building stood as rabban had restored it virtually untouched by the fighting although there had been looting by townspeople some of the furnishings in the main hall had been overturned or smashed paul strode through the main entrance with gurney halleck and stilgar a pace behind their escort fanned out into the great hall straightening the place and clearing an area for muaddib one squad began investigating that no sly trap had been planted here i remember the day we first came here with your father gurney said he glanced around at the beams and the high slitted windows i didnt like this place then and i like it less now one of our caves would be safer spoken like a true fremen stilgar said and he marked the cold smile that his words brought to muaddibs lips will you reconsider muaddib this place is a symbol paul said rabban lived here by occupying this place i seal my victory for all to understand send men through the building touch nothing just be certain no harkonnen people or toys remain as you command stilgar said and reluctance was heavy in his tone as he turned to obey communications men hurried into the room with their equipment began setting up near the massive fireplace the fremen guard that augmented the surviving fedaykin took up stations around the room there was muttering among them much darting of suspicious glances this had been too long a place of the enemy for them to accept their presence in it casually gurney have an escort bring my mother and chani paul said does chani know yet about our son the message was sent mlord are the makers being taken out of the basin yet yes mlord the storms almost spent whats the extent of the storm damage paul asked in the direct path on the landing field and across the spice storage yards of the plain extensive damage gurney said as much from battle as from the storm nothing money wont repair i presume paul said except for the lives mlord gurney said and there was a tone of reproach in his voice as though to say when did an atreides worry first about things when people were at stake but paul could only focus his attention on the inner eye and the gaps visible to him in the timewall that still lay across his path through each gap the jihad raged away down the corridors of the future he sighed crossed the hall seeing a chair against the wall the chair had once stood in the dining hall and might even have held his own father at the moment though it was only an object to rest his weariness and conceal it from the men he sat down pulling his robes around his legs loosening his stillsuit at the neck the emperor is still holed up in the remains of his ship gurney said for now contain him there paul said have they found the harkonnens yet theyre still examining the dead what reply from the ships up there he jerked his chin toward the ceiling no reply yet mlord paul sighed resting against the back of his chair presently he said bring me a captive sardaukar we must send a message to our emperor its time to discuss terms yes mlord gurney turned away dropped a hand signal to one of the fedaykin who took up closeguard position beside paul gurney paul whispered since weve been rejoined ive yet to hear you produce the proper quotation for the event he turned saw gurney swallow saw the sudden grim hardening of the mans jaw as you wish mlord gurney said he cleared his throat rasped and the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son paul closed his eyes forcing grief out of his mind letting it wait as he had once waited to mourn his father now he gave his thoughts over to this days accumulated discoveries the mixed futures and the hidden presence of alia within his awareness of all the uses of timevision this was the strangest i have breasted the future to place my words where only you can hear them alia had said even you can not do that my brother i find it an interesting play and oh yes ive killed our grandfather the demented old baron he had very little pain silence his time sense had seen her withdrawal muaddib paul opened his eyes to see stilgars blackbearded visage above him the dark eyes glaring with battle light youve found the body of the old baron paul said a hush of the person settled over stilgar how could you know he whispered we just found the body in that great pile of metal the emperor built paul ignored the question seeing gurney return accompanied by two fremen who supported a captive sardaukar heres one of them mlord gurney said he signed to the guard to hold the captive five paces in front of paul the sardaukars eyes paul noted carried a glazed expression of shock a blue bruise stretched from the bridge of his nose to the corner of his mouth he was of the blond chiselfeatured caste the look that seemed synonymous with rank among the sardaukar yet there were no insignia on his torn uniform except the gold buttons with the imperial crest and the tattered braid of his trousers i think this ones an officer mlord gurney said paul nodded said i am the duke paul atreides do you understand that man the sardaukar stared at him unmoving speak up paul said or your emperor may die the man blinked swallowed who am i paul demanded you are the duke paul atreides the man husked he seemed too submissive to paul but then the sardaukar had never been prepared for such happenings as this day theyd never known anything but victory which paul realized could be a weakness in itself he put that thought aside for later consideration in his own training program i have a message for you to carry to the emperor paul said and he couched his words in the ancient formula i a duke of a great house an imperial kinsman give my word of bond under the convention if the emperor and his people lay down their arms and come to me here i will guard their lives with my own paul held up his left hand with the ducal signet for the sardaukar to see i swear it by this the man wet his lips with his tongue glanced at gurney yes paul said who but an atreides could command the allegiance of gurney halleck i will carry the message the sardaukar said take him to our forward command post and send him in paul said yes mlord gurney motioned for the guard to obey led them out paul turned back to stilgar chani and your mother have arrived stilgar said chani has asked time to be alone with her grief the reverend mother sought a moment in the weirding room i know not why my mothers sick with longing for a planet she may never see paul said where water falls from the sky and plants grow so thickly you can not walk between them water from the sky stilgar whispered in that instant paul saw how stilgar had been transformed from the fremen naib to a creature of the lisan algaib a receptacle for awe and obedience it was a lessening of the man and paul felt the ghostwind of the jihad in it i have seen a friend become a worshiper he thought in a rush of loneliness paul glanced around the room noting how proper and onreview his guards had become in his presence he sensed the subtle prideful competition among them each hoping for notice from muaddib muaddib from whom all blessings flow he thought and it was the bitterest thought of his life they sense that i must take the throne he thought but they can not know i do it to prevent the jihad stilgar cleared his throat said rabban too is dead paul nodded guards to the right suddenly snapped aside standing at attention to open an aisle for jessica she wore her black aba and walked with a hint of striding across sand but paul noted how this house had restored to her something of what she had once been here concubine to a ruling duke her presence carried some of its old assertiveness jessica stopped in front of paul looked down at him she saw his fatigue and how he hid it but found no compassion for him it was as though she had been rendered incapable of any emotion for her son jessica had entered the great hall wondering why the place refused to fit itself snugly in to her memories it remained a foreign room as though she had never walked here never walked here with her beloved leto never confronted a drunken duncan idaho here never never never there should be a wordtension directly opposite to adab the demanding memory she thought there should be a word for memories that deny themselves where is alia she asked out doing what any good fremen child should be doing in such times paul said shes killing enemy wounded and marking their bodies for the waterrecovery teams paul you must understand that she does this out of kindness he said isnt it odd how we misunderstand the hidden unity of kindness and cruelty jessica glared at her son shocked by the profound change in him was it his childs death did this she wondered and she said the men tell strange stories of you paul they say youve all the powers of the legend nothing can be hidden from you that you see where others can not see a bene gesserit should ask about legends he asked ive had a hand in whatever you are she admitted but you mustnt expect me to how would you like to live billions upon billions of lives paul asked theres a fabric of legends for you think of all those experiences the wisdom theyd bring but wisdom tempers love doesnt it and it puts a new shape on hate how can you tell whats ruthless unless youve plumbed the depths of both cruelty and kindness you should fear me mother i am the kwisatz haderach jessica tried to swallow in a dry throat presently she said once you denied to me that you were the kwisatz haderach paul shook his head i can deny nothing any more he looked up into her eyes the emperor and his people come now they will be announced any moment stand beside me i wish a clear view of them my future bride will be among them paul jessica snapped dont make the mistake your father made shes a princess paul said shes my key to the throne and thats all shell ever be mistake you think because im what you made me that i can not feel the need for revenge even on the innocent she asked and she thought he must not make the mistakes i made there are no innocent any more paul said tell that to chani jessica said and gestured toward the passage from the rear of the residency chani entered the great hall there walking between the fremen guards as though unaware of them her hood and stillsuit cap were thrown back face mask fastened aside she walked with a fragile uncertainty as she crossed the room to stand beside jessica paul saw the marks of tears on her cheeks she gives water to the dead he felt a pang of grief strike through him but it was as though he could only feel this thing through chanis presence he is dead beloved chani said our son is dead holding himself under stiff control paul got to his feet he reached out touched chanis cheek feeling the dampness of her tears he can not be replaced paul said but there will be other sons it is usul who promises this gently he moved her aside gestured to stilgar muaddib stilgar said they come from the ship the emperor and his people paul said i will stand here assemble the captives in an open space in the center of the room they will be kept at a distance of ten meters from me unless i command otherwise as you command muaddib as stilgar turned to obey paul heard the awed muttering of fremen guards you see he knew no one told him but he knew the emperors entourage could be heard approaching now his sardaukar humming one of their marching tunes to keep up their spirits there came a murmur of voices at the entrance and gurney halleck passed through the guard crossed to confer with stilgar then moved to pauls side a strange look in his eyes will i lose gurney too paul wondered the way i lost stilgar losing a friend to gain a creature they have no throwing weapons gurney said ive made sure of that myself he glanced around the room seeing pauls preparations feydrautha harkonnen is with them shall i cut him out leave him therere some guild people too demanding special privileges threatening an embargo against arrakis i told them id give you their message let them threaten paul jessica hissed behind him hes talking about the guild ill pull their fangs presently paul said and he thought then about the guild the force that had specialized for so long that it had become a parasite unable to exist independently of the life upon which it fed they had never dared grasp the sword and now they could not grasp it they might have taken arrakis when they realized the error of specializing on the melange awarenessspectrum narcotic for their navigators they could have done this lived their glorious day and died instead theyd existed from moment to moment hoping the seas in which they swam might produce a new host when the old one died the guild navigators gifted with limited prescience had made the fatal decision theyd chosen always the clear safe course that leads ever downward into stagnation let them look closely at their new host paul thought theres also a bene gesserit reverend mother who says shes a friend of your mother gurney said my mother has no bene gesserit friends again gurney glanced around the great hall then bent close to pauls ear thufir hawats with em mlord i had no chance to see him alone but he used our old hand signs to say hes been working with the harkonnens thought you were dead says hes to be left among em you left thufir among those he wanted it and i thought it best if theres something wrong hes where we can control him if not weve an ear on the other side paul thought then of prescient glimpses into the possibilities of this moment and one timeline where thufir carried a poisoned needle which the emperor commanded he use against this upstart duke the entrance guards stepped aside formed a short corridor of lances there came a murmurous swish of garments feet rasping the sand that had drifted into the residency the padishah emperor shaddam iv led his people into the hall his burseg helmet had been lost and the red hair stood out in disarray his uniforms left sleeve had been ripped along the inner seam he was beltless and without weapons but his presence moved with him like a forceshield bubble that kept his immediate area open a fremen lance dropped across his path stopped him where paul had ordered the others bunched up behind a montage of color of shuffling and of staring faces paul swept his gaze across the group saw women who hid signs of weeping saw the lackeys who had come to enjoy grandstand seats at a sardaukar victory and now stood choked to silence by defeat paul saw the birdbright eyes of the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam glaring beneath her black hood and beside her the narrow furtiveness of feydrautha harkonnen theres a face time betrayed to me paul thought he looked beyond feydrautha then attracted by a movement seeing there a narrow weaselish face hed never before encountered not in time or out of it it was a face he felt he should know and the feeling carried with it a marker of fear why should i fear that man he wondered he leaned toward his mother whispered that man to the left of the reverend mother the evillooking one who is that jessica looked recognizing the face from her dukes dossiers count fenring she said the one who was here immediately before us a geneticeunuch and a killer the emperors errand boy paul thought and the thought was a shock crashing across his consciousness because he had seen the emperor in uncounted associations spread through the possible futuresbut never once had count fenring appeared within those prescient visions it occurred to paul then that he had seen his own dead body along countless reaches of the time web but never once had he seen his moment of death have i been denied a glimpse of this man because he is the one who kills me paul wondered the thought sent a pang of foreboding through him he forced his attention away from fenring looked now at the remnants of sardaukar men and officers the bitterness on their faces and the desperation here and there among them faces caught pauls attention briefly sardaukar officers measuring the preparations within this room planning and scheming yet for a way to turn defeat into victory pauls attention came at last to a tall blonde woman greeneyed a face of patrician beauty classic in its hauteur untouched by tears completely undefeated without being told it paul knew her princess royal bene gesserit trained a face that time vision had shown him in many aspects irulan theres my key he thought then he saw movement in the clustered people a face and figure emerged thufir hawat the seamed old features with darkly stained lips the hunched shoulders the look of fragile age about him theres thufir hawat paul said let him stand free gurney mlord gurney said let him stand free paul repeated gurney nodded hawat shambled forward as a fremen lance was lifted and replaced behind him the rheumy eyes peered at paul measuring seeking paul stepped forward one pace sensed the tense waiting movement of the emperor and his people hawats gaze stabbed past paul and the old man said lady jessica i but learned this day how ive wronged you in my thoughts you neednt forgive paul waited but his mother remained silent thufir old friend paul said as you can see my back is toward no door the universe is full of doors hawat said am i my fathers son paul asked more like your grandfathers hawat rasped youve his manner and the look of him in your eyes yet im my fathers son paul said for i say to you thufir that in payment for your years of service to my family you may now ask anything you wish of me anything at all do you need my life now thufir it is yours paul stepped forward a pace hands at his side seeing the look of awareness grow in hawats eyes he realizes that i know of the treachery paul thought pitching his voice to carry in a halfwhisper for hawats ears alone paul said i mean this thufir if youre to strike me do it now i but wanted to stand before you once more my duke hawat said and paul became aware for the first time of the effort the old man exerted to keep from falling paul reached out supported hawat by the shoulders feeling the muscle tremors beneath his hands is there pain old friend paul asked there is pain my duke hawat agreed but the pleasure is greater he half turned in pauls arms extended his left hand palm up toward the emperor exposing the tiny needle cupped against the fingers see majesty he called see your traitors needle did you think that i whove given my life to service of the atreides would give them less now paul staggered as the old man sagged in his arms felt the death there the utter flaccidity gently paul lowered hawat to the floor straightened and signed for guardsmen to carry the body away silence held the hall while his command was obeyed a look of deadly waiting held the emperors face now eyes that had never admitted fear admitted it at last majesty paul said and noted the jerk of surprised attention in the tall princess royal the words had been uttered with the bene gesserit controlled atonals carrying in it every shade of contempt and scorn that paul could put there benegesserit trained indeed paul thought the emperor cleared his throat said perhaps my respected kinsman believes he has things all his own way now nothing could be more remote from fact you have violated the convention used atomics against i used atomics against a natural feature of the desert paul said it was in my way and i was in a hurry to get to you majesty to ask your explanation for some of your strange activities theres a massed armada of the great houses in space over arrakis right now the emperor said ive but to say the word and theyll oh yes paul said i almost forgot about them he searched through the emperors suite until he saw the faces of the two guildsmen spoke aside to gurney are those the guild agents gurney the two fat ones dressed in gray over there yes mlord you two paul said pointing get out of there immediately and dispatch messages that will get that fleet on its way home after this youll ask my permission before the guild doesnt take your orders the taller of the two barked he and his companion pushed through to the barrier lances which were raised at a nod from paul the two men stepped out and the taller leveled an arm at paul said you may very well be under embargo for your if i hear any more nonsense from either of you paul said ill give the order thatll destroy all spice production on arrakis forever are you mad the tall guildsman demanded he fell back half a step you grant that i have the power to do this thing then paul asked the guildsman seemed to stare into space for a moment then yes you could do it but you must not ahhh paul said and nodded to himself guild navigators both of you eh yes the shorter of the pair said you would blind yourself too and condemn us all to slow death have you any idea what it means to be deprived of the spice liquor once youre addicted the eye that looks ahead to the safe course is closed forever paul said the guild is crippled humans become little isolated clusters on their isolated planets you know i might do this thing out of pure spite or out of ennui let us talk this over privately the taller guildsman said im sure we can come to some compromise that is send the message to your people over arrakis paul said i grow tired of this argument if that fleet over us doesnt leave soon therell be no need for us to talk he nodded toward his communications men at the side of the hall you may use our equipment first we must discuss this the tall guildsman said we can not just do it paul barked the power to destroy a thing is the absolute control over it youve agreed i have that power we are not here to discuss or to negotiate or to compromise you will obey my orders or suffer the immediate consequences he means it the shorter guildsman said and paul saw the fear grip them slowly the two crossed to the fremen communications equipment will they obey gurney asked they have a narrow vision of time paul said they can see ahead to a blank wall marking the consequences of disobedience every guild navigator on every ship over us can look ahead to that same wall theyll obey paul turned back to look at the emperor said when they permitted you to mount your fathers throne it was only on the assurance that youd keep the spice flowing youve failed them majesty do you know the consequences nobody permitted me to stop playing the fool paul barked the guild is like a village beside a river they need the water but can only dip out what they require they can not dam the river and control it because that focuses attention on what they take it brings down eventual destruction the spice flow thats their river and i have built a dam but my dam is such that you can not destroy it without destroying the river the emperor brushed a hand through his red hair glanced at the backs of the two guildsmen even your bene gesserit truthsayer is trembling paul said there are other poisons the reverend mothers can use for their tricks but once theyve used the spice liquor the others no longer work the old woman pulled her shapeless black robes around her pressed forward out of the crowd to stand at the barrier lances reverend mother gaius helen mohiam paul said it has been a long time since caladan hasnt it she looked past him at his mother said well jessica i see that your son is indeed the one for that you can be forgiven even the abomination of your daughter paul stilled a cold piercing anger said youve never had the right or cause to forgive my mother anything the old woman locked eyes with him try your tricks on me old witch paul said wheres your gom jabbar try looking into that place where you dare not look youll find me there staring out at you the old woman dropped her gaze have you nothing to say paul demanded i welcomed you to the ranks of humans she muttered dont besmirch that paul raised his voice observe her comrades this is a bene gesserit reverend mother patient in a patient cause she could wait with her sisters ninety generations for the proper combination of genes and environment to produce the one person their schemes required observe her she knows now that the ninety generations have produced that person here i stand but i will never do her bidding jessica the old woman screamed silence him silence him yourself jessica said paul glared at the old woman for your part in all this i could gladly have you strangled he said you couldnt prevent it he snapped as she stiffened in rage but i think it better punishment that you live out your years never able to touch me or bend me to a single thing your scheming desires jessica what have you done the old woman demanded ill give you only one thing paul said you saw part of what the race needs but how poorly you saw it you think to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to your master plan how little you understand of what you mustnt speak of these things the old woman hissed silence paul roared the word seemed to take substance as it twisted through the air between them under pauls control the old woman reeled back into the arms of those behind her face blank with shock at the power with which he had seized her psyche jessica she whispered jessica i remember your gom jabbar paul said you remember mine i can kill you with a word the fremen around the ball glanced knowingly at each other did the legend not say and his word shall carry death eternal to those who stand against righteousness paul turned his attention to the tall princess royal standing beside her emperor father keeping his eyes focused on her he said majesty we both know the way out of our difficulty the emperor glanced at his daughter back to paul you dare you an adventurer without family a nobody from youve already admitted who i am paul said royal kinsman you said lets stop this nonsense i am your ruler the emperor said paul glanced at the guildsmen standing now at the communications equipment and facing him one of them nodded i could force it paul said you will not dare the emperor grated paul merely stared at him the princess royal put a hand on her fathers arm father she said and her voice was silky soft soothing dont try your tricks on me the emperor said he looked at her you dont need to do this daughter weve other resources that but heres a man fit to be your son she said the old reverend mother her composure regained forced her way to the emperors side leaned close to his ear and whispered she pleads your case jessica said paul continued to look at the goldenhaired princess aside to his mother he said thats irulan the oldest isnt it yes chani moved up on pauls other side said do you wish me to leave muaddib he glanced at her leave youll never again leave my side theres nothing binding between us chani said paul looked down at her for a silent moment then speak only truth with me my sihaya as she started to reply he silenced her with a finger to her lips that which binds us can not be loosed he said now watch these matters closely for i wish to see this room later through your wisdom the emperor and his truthsayer were carrying on a heated lowvoiced argument paul spoke to his mother she reminds him that its part of their agreement to place a bene gesserit on the throne and irulan is the one theyve groomed for it was that their plan jessica said isnt it obvious paul asked i see the signs jessica snapped my question was meant to remind you that you should not try to teach me those matters in which i instructed you paul glanced at her caught a cold smile on her lips gurney halleck leaned between them said i remind you mlord that theres a harkonnen in that bunch he nodded toward the darkhaired feydrautha pressed against a barrier lance on the left the one with the squinting eyes there on the left as evil a face as i ever say you promised me once that thank you gurney paul said its the nabaron baron now that the old mans dead gurney said hell do for what ive in can you take him gurney mlord jests that argument between the emperor and his witch has gone on long enough dont you think mother she nodded indeed paul raised his voice called out to the emperor majesty is there a harkonnen among you royal disdain revealed itself in the way the emperor turned to look at paul i believe my entourage has been placed under the protection of your ducal word he said my question was for information only paul said i wish to know if a harkonnen is officially a part of your entourage or if a harkonnen is merely hiding behind a technicality out of cowardice the emperors smile was calculating anyone accepted into the imperial company is a member of my entourage you have the word of a duke paul said but muaddib is another matter he may not recognize your definition of what constitutes an entourage my friend gurney halleck wishes to kill a harkonnen if he kanly feydrautha shouted he pressed against the barrier lance your father named this vendetta atreides you call me coward while you hide among your women and offer to send a lackey against me the old truthsayer whispered something fiercely into the emperors ear but he pushed her aside said kanly is it there are strict rules for kanly paul put a stop to this jessica said mlord gurney said you promised me my day against the harkonnens youve had your day against them paul said and he felt a harlequin abandon take over his emotions he slipped his robe and hood from his shoulders handed them to his mother with his belt and crysknife began unstrapping his stillsuit he sensed now that the universe focused on this moment theres no need for this jessica said there are easier ways paul paul stepped out of his stillsuit slipped the crysknife from its sheath in his mothers hand i know he said poison an assassin all the old familiar ways you promised me a harkonnen gurney hissed and paul marked the rage in the mans face the way the inkvine scar stood out dark and ridged you owe it to me mlord have you suffered more from them than i paul asked my sister gurney rasped my years in the slave pits my father paul said my good friends and companions thufir hawat and duncan idaho my years as a fugitive without rank or succor and one more thing it is now kanly and you know as well as i the rules that must prevail hallecks shoulders sagged mlord if that swine hes no more than a beast youd spurn with your foot and discard the shoe because itd been contaminated call in an executioner if you must or let me do it but dont offer yourself to muaddib need not do this thing chani said he glanced at her saw the fear for him in her eyes but the duke paul must he said this is a harkonnen animal gurney rasped paul hesitated on the point of revealing his own harkonnen ancestry stopped at a sharp look from his mother said merely but this being has human shape gurney and deserves human doubt gurney said if he so much as please stand aside paul said he hefted the crysknife pushed gurney gently aside gurney jessica said she touched gurneys arm hes like his grandfather in this mood dont distract him its the only thing you can do for him now and she thought great mother what irony the emperor was studying feydrautha seeing the heavy shoulders the thick muscles he turned to look at paul a stringy whipcord of a youth not as desiccated as the arrakeen natives but with ribs there to count and sunken in the flanks so that the ripple and gather of muscles could be followed under the skin jessica leaned close to paul pitched her voice for his ears alone one thing son sometimes a dangerous person is prepared by the bene gesserit a word implanted into the deepest recesses by the old pleasurepain methods the wordsound most frequently used is uroshnor if this ones been prepared as i strongly suspect that word uttered in his ear will render his muscles flaccid and i want no special advantage for this one paul said step back out of my way gurney spoke to her why is he doing this does he think to get himself killed and achieve martyrdom this fremen religious prattle is that what clouds his reason jessica hid her face in her hands realizing that she did not know fully why paul took this course she could feel death in the room and knew that the changed paul was capable of such a thing as gurney suggested every talent within her focused on the need to protect her son but there was nothing she could do is it this religious prattle gurney insisted be silent jessica whispered and pray the emperors face was touched by an abrupt smile if feydrautha harkonnen of my entourage so wishes he said i relieve him of all restraint and give him freedom to choose his own course in this the emperor waved a hand toward pauls fedaykin guards one of your rabble has my belt and short blade if feydrautha wishes it he may meet you with my blade in his hand i wish it feydrautha said and paul saw the elation on the mans face hes overconfident paul thought theres a natural advantage i can accept get the emperors blade paul said and watched as his command was obeyed put it on the floor there he indicated a place with his foot clear the imperial rabble back against the wall and let the harkonnen stand clear a flurry of robes scraping of feet lowvoiced commands and protests accompanied obedience to pauls command the guildsmen remained standing near the communications equipment they frowned at paul in obvious indecision theyre accustomed to seeing the future paul thought in this place and time theyre blind even as i am and he sampled the timewinds sensing the turmoil the storm nexus that now focused on this moment place even the faint gaps were closed now here was the unborn jihad he knew here was the race consciousness that he had known once as his own terrible purpose here was reason enough for a kwisatz haderach or a lisan algaib or even the halting schemes of the bene gesserit the race of humans had felt its own dormancy sensed itself grown stale and knew now only the need to experience turmoil in which the genes would mingle and the strong new mixtures survive all humans were alive as an unconscious single organism in this moment experiencing a kind of sexual heat that could override any barrier and paul saw how futile were any efforts of his to change any smallest bit of this he had thought to oppose the jihad within himself but the jihad would be his legions would rage out from arrakis even without him they needed only the legend he already had become he had shown them the way given them mastery even over the guild which must have the spice to exist a sense of failure pervaded him and he saw through it that feydrautha harkonnen had slipped out of the torn uniform stripped down to a fighting girdle with a mail core this is the climax paul thought from here the future will open the clouds part onto a kind of glory and if i die here theyll say i sacrificed myself that my spirit might lead them and if i live theyll say nothing can oppose muaddib is the atreides ready feydrautha called using the words of the ancient kanly ritual paul chose to answer him in the fremen way may thy knife chip and shatter he pointed to the emperors blade on the floor indicating that feydrautha should advance and take it keeping his attention on paul feydrautha picked up the knife balancing it a moment in his hand to get the feel of it excitement kindled in him this was a fight he had dreamed about man against man skill against skill with no shields intervening he could see a way to power opening before him because the emperor surely would reward whoever killed this troublesome duke the reward might even be that haughty daughter and a share of the throne and this yokel duke this backworld adventurer could not possibly be a match for a harkonnen trained in every device and every treachery by a thousand arena combats and the yokel had no way of knowing he faced more weapons than a knife here let us see if youre proof against poison feydrautha thought he saluted paul with the emperors blade said meet your death fool shall we fight cousin paul asked and he catfooted forward eyes on the waiting blade his body crouched low with his own milkwhite crysknife pointing out as though an extension of his arm they circled each other bare feet grating on the floor watching with eyes intent for the slightest opening how beautifully you dance feydrautha said hes a talker paul thought theres another weakness he grows uneasy in the face of silence have you been shriven feydrautha asked still paul circled in silence and the old reverend mother watching the fight from the press of the emperors suite felt herself trembling the atreides youth had called the harkonnen cousin it could only mean he knew the ancestry they shared easy to understand because he was the kwisatz haderach but the words forced her to focus on the only thing that mattered to her here this could be a major catastrophe for the bene gesserit breeding scheme she had seen something of what paul had seen here that feydrautha might kill but not be victorious another thought though almost overwhelmed her two end products of this long and costly program faced each other in a fight to the death that might easily claim both of them if both died here that would leave only feydrauthas bastard daughter still a baby an unknown an unmeasured factor and alia the abomination perhaps you have only pagan rites here feydrautha said would you like the emperors truthsayer to prepare your spirit for its journey paul smiled circling to the right alert his black thoughts suppressed by the needs of the moment feydrautha leaped feinting with right hand but with the knife shifted in a blur to his left hand paul dodged easily noting the shieldconditioned hesitation in feydrauthas thrust still it was not as great a shield conditioning as some paul had seen and he sensed that feydrautha had fought before against unshielded foes does an atreides run or stand and fight feydrautha asked paul resumed his silent circling idahos words came back to him the words of training from the longago practice floor on caladan use the first moments in study you may miss many an opportunity for quick victory this way but the moments of study are insurance of success take your time and be sure perhaps you think this dance prolongs your life a few moments feydrautha said well and good he stopped the circling straightened paul had seen enough for a first approximation feydrautha led to the left side presenting the right hip as though the mailed fighting girdle could protect his entire side it was the action of a man trained to the shield and with a knife in both hands or and paul hesitated the girdle was more than it seemed the harkonnen appeared too confident against a man whod this day led the forces of victory against sardaukar legions feydrautha noted the hesitation said why prolong the inevitable you but keep me from exercising my rights over this ball of dirt if its a flipdart paul thought its a cunning one the girdle shows no signs of tampering why dont you speak feydrautha demanded paul resumed his probing circle allowing himself a cold smile at the tone of unease in feydrauthas voice evidence that the pressure of silence was building you smile eh feydrautha asked and he leaped in midsentence expecting the slight hesitation paul almost failed to evade the downflash of blade felt its tip scratch his left arm he silenced the sudden pain there his mind flooded with realization that the earlier hesitation had been a trick an overfeint here was more of an opponent than he had expected there would be tricks within tricks within tricks your own thufir hawat taught me some of my skills feydrautha said he gave me first blood too bad the old fool didnt live to see it and paul recalled that idaho had once said expect only what happens in the fight that way youll never be surprised again the two circled each other crouched cautious paul saw the return of elation to his opponent wondered at it did a scratch signify that much to the man unless there were poison on the blade but how could there be his own men had handled the weapon snooped it before passing it they were too well trained to miss an obvious thing like that that woman you were talking to over there feydrautha said the little one is she something special to you a pet perhaps will she deserve my special attentions paul remained silent probing with his inner senses examining the blood from the wound finding a trace of soporific from the emperors blade he realigned his own metabolism to match this threat and change the molecules of the soporific but he felt a thrill of doubt theyd been prepared with soporific on a blade a soporific nothing to alert a poison snooper but strong enough to slow the muscles it touched his enemies had their own plans within plans their own stacked treacheries again feydrautha leaped stabbing paul the smile frozen on his face feinted with slowness as though inhibited by the drug and at the last instant dodged to meet the downflashing arm on the crysknifes point feydrautha ducked sideways and was out and away his blade shifted to his left hand and the measure of him that only a slight paleness of jaw betrayed the acid pain where paul had cut him let him know his own moment of doubt paul thought let him suspect poison treachery feydrautha shouted hes poisoned me i do feel poison in my arm paul dropped his cloak of silence said only a little acid to counter the soporific on the emperors blade feydrautha matched pauls cold smile lifted blade in left hand for a mock salute his eyes glared rage behind the knife paul shifted his crysknife to his left hand matching his opponent again they circled probing feydrautha began closing the space between them edging in knife held high anger showing itself in squint of eye and set of jaw he feinted right and under and they were pressed against each other knife hands gripped straining paul cautious of feydrauthas right hip where he suspected a poison flipdart forced the turn to the right he almost failed to see the needlepoint flick out beneath the belt line a shift and a giving in feydrauthas motion warned him the tiny point missed pauls flesh by the barest fraction on the left hip treachery within treachery within treachery paul reminded himself using bene gesserittrained muscles he sagged to catch a reflex in feydrautha but the necessity of avoiding the tiny point jutting from his opponents hip threw paul off just enough that he missed his footing and found himself thrown hard to the floor feydrautha on top you see it there on my hip feydrautha whispered your death fool and he began twisting himself around forcing the poisoned needle closer and closer itll stop your muscles and my knife will finish you therell be never a trace left to detect paul strained hearing the silent screams in his mind his cellstamped ancestors demanding that he use the secret word to slow feydrautha to save himself i will not say it paul gasped feydrautha gaped at him caught in the merest fraction of hesitation it was enough for paul to find the weakness of balance in one of his opponents leg muscles and their positions were reversed feydrautha lay partly underneath with right hip high unable to turn because of the tiny needlepoint caught against the floor beneath him paul twisted his left hand free aided by the lubrication of blood from his arm thrust once hard up underneath feydrauthas jaw the point slid home into the brain feydrautha jerked and sagged back still held partly on his side by the needle imbedded in the floor breathing deeply to restore his calm paul pushed himself away and got to his feet he stood over the body knife in hand raised his eyes with deliberate slowness to look across the room at the emperor majesty paul said your force is reduced by one more shall we now shed sham and pretense shall we now discuss what must be your daughter wed to me and the way opened for an atreides to sit on the throne the emperor turned looked at count fenring the count met his stare gray eyes against green the thought lay there clearly between them their association so long that understanding could be achieved with a glance kill this upstart for me the emperor was saying the atreides is young and resourceful yes but he is also tired from long effort and hed be no match for you anyway call him out now you know the way of it kill him slowly fenring moved his head a prolonged turning until he faced paul do it the emperor hissed the count focused on paul seeing with eyes his lady margot had trained in the bene gesserit way aware of the mystery and hidden grandeur about this atreides youth i could kill him fenring thought and he knew this for a truth something in his own secretive depths stayed the count then and he glimpsed briefly inadequately the advantage he held over paul a way of hiding from the youth a furtiveness of person and motives that no eye could penetrate paul aware of some of this from the way the time nexus boiled understood at last why he had never seen fenring along the webs of prescience fenring was one of the mighthavebeens an almost kwisatz haderach crippled by a flaw in the genetic pattern a eunuch his talent concentrated into furtiveness and inner seclusion a deep compassion for the count flowed through paul the first sense of brotherhood hed ever experienced fenring reading pauls emotion said majesty i must refuse rage overcame shaddam iv he took two short steps through the entourage cuffed fenring viciously across the jaw a dark flush spread up and over the counts face he looked directly at the emperor spoke with deliberate lack of emphasis we have been friends majesty what i do now is out of friendship i shall forget that you struck me paul cleared his throat said we were speaking of the throne majesty the emperor whirled glared at paul i sit on the throne he barked you shall have a throne on salusa secundus paul said i put down my arms and came here on your word of bond the emperor shouted you dare threaten your person is safe in my presence paul said an atreides promised it muaddib however sentences you to your prison planet but have no fear majesty i will ease the harshness of the place with all the powers at my disposal it shall become a garden world full of gentle things as the hidden import of pauls words grew in the emperors mind he glared across the room at paul now we see true motives he sneered indeed paul said and what of arrakis the emperor asked another garden world full of gentle things the fremen have the word of muaddib paul said there will be flowing water here open to the sky and green oases rich with good things but we have the spice to think of too thus there will always be desert on arrakis and fierce winds and trials to toughen a man we fremen have a saying god created arrakis to train the faithful one can not go against the word of god the old truthsayer the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam had her own view of the hidden meaning in pauls words now she glimpsed the jihad and said you can not loose these people upon the universe you will think back to the gentle ways of the sardaukar paul snapped you can not she whispered youre a truthsayer paul said review your words he glanced at the princess royal back to the emperor best be done quickly majesty the emperor turned a stricken look upon his daughter she touched his arm spoke soothingly for this i was trained father he took a deep breath you can not stay this thing the old truthsayer muttered the emperor straightened standing stiffly with a look of remembered dignity who will negotiate for you kinsman he asked paul turned saw his mother her eyes heavylidded standing with chani in a squad of fedaykin guards he crossed to them stood looking down at chani i know the reasons chani whispered if it must be usul paul hearing the secret tears in her voice touched her cheek my sihaya need fear nothing ever he whispered he dropped his arm faced his mother you will negotiate for me mother with chani by your side she has wisdom and sharp eyes and it is wisely said that no one bargains tougher than a fremen she will be looking through the eyes of her love for me and with the thought of her sons to be what they will need listen to her jessica sensed the harsh calculation in her son put down a shudder what are your instructions she asked the emperors entire choam company holdings as dowry he said entire she was shocked almost speechless he is to be stripped ill want an earldom and choam directorship for gurney halleck and him in the fief of caladan there will be titles and attendant power for every surviving atreides man not excepting the lowliest trooper what of the fremen jessica asked the fremen are mine paul said what they receive shall be dispensed by muaddib itll begin with stilgar as governor on arrakis but that can wait and for me jessica asked is there something you wish perhaps caladan she said looking at gurney im not certain ive become too much the fremen and the reverend mother i need a time of peace and stillness in which to think that you shall have paul said and anything else that gurney or i can give you jessica nodded feeling suddenly old and tired she looked at chani and for the royal concubine no title for me chani whispered nothing i beg of you paul stared down into her eyes remembering her suddenly as she had stood once with little leto in her arms their child now dead in this violence i swear to you now he whispered that youll need no title that woman over there will be my wife and you but a concubine because this is a political thing and we must weld peace out of this moment enlist the great houses of the landsraad we must obey the forms yet that princess shall have no more of me than my name no child of mine nor touch nor softness of glance nor instant of desire so you say now chani said she glanced across the room at the tail princess do you know so little of my son jessica whispered see that princess standing there so haughty and confident they say she has pretensions of a literary nature let us hope she finds solace in such things shell have little else a bitter laugh escaped jessica think on it chani that princess will have the name yet shell live as less than a concubine never to know a moment of tenderness from the man to whom shes bound while we chani we who carry the name of concubine history will call us wives appendix i the ecology of dune beyond a critical point within a finite space freedom diminishes as numbers increase this is as true of humans in the finite space of a planetary ecosystem as it is of gas molecules in a sealed flask the human question is not how many can possibly survive within the system but what kind of existence is possible for those who do survive pardot kynes first planetologist of arrakis the effect of arrakis on the mind of the newcomer usually is that of overpowering barren land the stranger might think nothing could live or grow in the open here that this was the true wasteland that had never been fertile and never would be to pardot kynes the planet was merely an expression of energy a machine being driven by its sun what it needed was reshaping to fit it to mans needs his mind went directly to the freemoving human population the fremen what a challenge what a tool they could be fremen an ecological and geological force of almost unlimited potential a direct and simple man in many ways pardot kynes one must evade harkonnen restrictions excellent then one marries a fremen woman when she gives you a fremen son you begin with him with lietkynes and the other children teaching them ecological literacy creating a new language with symbols that arm the mind to manipulate an entire landscape its climate seasonal limits and finally to break through all ideas of force into the dazzling awareness of order theres an internally recognized beauty of motion and balance on any manhealthy planet kynes said you see in this beauty a dynamic stabilizing effect essential to all life its aim is simple to maintain and produce coordinated patterns of greater and greater diversity life improves the closed systems capacity to sustain life life all life is in the service of life necessary nutrients are made available to life by life in greater and greater richness as the diversity of life increases the entire landscape comes alive filled with relationships and relationships within relationships this was pardot kynes lecturing to a sietch warren class before the lectures though he had to convince the fremen to understand how this came about you must first understand the enormous singlemindedness the innocence with which he approached any problem he was not naive he merely permitted himself no distractions he was exploring the arrakis landscape in a oneman groundcar one hot afternoon when he stumbled onto a deplorably common scene six harkonnen bravos shielded and fully armed had trapped three fremen youths in the open behind the shield wall near the village of windsack to kynes it was a dingdong battle more slapstick then real until he focused on the fact that the harkonnens intended to kill the fremen by this time one of the youths was down with a severed artery two of the bravos were down as well but it was still four armed men against two striplings kynes wasnt brave he merely had that singlemindedness and caution the harkonnens were killing fremen they were destroying the tools with which he intended to remake a planet he triggered his own shield waded in and had two of the harkonnens dead with a sliptip before they knew anyone was behind them he dodged a sword thrust from one of the others slit the mans throat with a neat entrisseur and left the lone remaining bravo to the two fremen youths turning his full attention to saving the lad on the ground and save the lad he did while the sixth harkonnen was being dispatched now here was a pretty kettle of sandtrout the fremen didnt know what to make of kynes they knew who he was of course no man arrived on arrakis without a full dossier finding its way into the fremen strongholds they knew him he was an imperial servant but he killed harkonnens adults might have shrugged and with some regret sent his shade to join those of the six dead men on the ground but these fremen were inexperienced youths and all they could see was that they owed this imperial servant a mortal obligation kynes wound up two days later in a sietch that looked down on wind pass to him it was all very natural he talked to the fremen about water about dunes anchored by grass about palmaries filled with date palms about open qanats flowing across the desert he talked and talked and talked all around him raged a debate that kynes never saw what to do with this madman he knew the location of a major sietch what to do what of his words this mad talk about a paradise on arrakis just talk he knows too much but he killed harkonnens what of the water burden when did we owe the imperium anything he killed harkonnens anyone can kill harkonnens i have done it myself but what of this talk about the flowering of arrakis very simple where is the water for this he says it is here and he did save three of ours he saved three fools who had put themselves in the way of the harkonnen fist and he has seen crysknives the necessary decision was known for hours before it was voiced the tau of a sietch tells its members what they must do even the most brutal necessity is known an experienced fighter was sent with a consecrated knife to do the job two watermen followed him to get the water from the body brutal necessity its doubtful that kynes even focused on his wouldbe executioner he was talking to a group that spread around him at a cautious distance he walked as he talked a short circle gesturing open water kynes said walk in the open without stillsuits water for dipping it out of a pond portyguls the knifeman confronted him remove yourself kynes said and went on talking about secret windtraps he brushed past the man kynes back stood open for the ceremonial blow what went on in that wouldbe executioners mind can not be known now did he finally listen to kynes and believe who knows but what he did is a matter of record uliet was his name older liet uliet walked three paces and deliberately fell on his own knife thus removing himself suicide some say shaihulud moved him talk about omens from that instant kynes had but to point saying go there entire fremen tribes went men died women died children died but they went kynes returned to his imperial chores directing the biological testing stations and now fremen began to appear among the station personnel the fremen looked at each other they were infiltrating the system a possibility theyd never considered station tools began finding their way into the sietch warrens especially cutterays which were used to dig underground catchbasins and hidden windtraps water began collecting in the basins it became apparent to the fremen that kynes was not a madman totally just mad enough to be holy he was one of the umma the brotherhood of prophets the shade of uliet was advanced to the sadus the throne of heavenly judges kynes direct savagely intent kynes knew that highly organized research is guaranteed to produce nothing new he set up smallunit experiments with regular interchange of data for a swift tansley effect let each group find its own path they must accumulate millions of tiny facts he organized only isolated and rough runthrough tests to put their difficulties into perspective core samplings were made throughout the bled charts were developed on the long drifts of weather that are called climate he found that in the wide belt contained by the degree lines north and south temperatures for thousands of years hadnt gone outside the degrees absolute range and that this belt had long growing seasons where temperatures ranged from to degrees absolute the bonanza range for terraform life once they solved the water problem when will we solve it the fremen asked when will we see arrakis as a paradise in the manner of a teacher answering a child who has asked the sum of plus kynes told them from three hundred to five hundred years a lesser folk might have howled in dismay but the fremen had learned patience from men with whips it was a bit longer than they had anticipated but they all could see that the blessed day was coming they tightened their sashes and went back to work somehow the disappointment made the prospect of paradise more real the concern on arrakis was not with water but with moisture pets were almost unknown stock animals rare some smugglers employed the domesticated desert ass the kulon but the water price was high even when the beasts were fitted with modified stillsuits kynes thought of installing reduction plants to recover water from the hydrogen and oxygen locked in native rock but the energycost factor was far too high the polar caps disregarding the false sense of water security they gave the pyons held far too small an amount for his project and he already suspected where the water had to be there was that consistent increase of moisture at median altitudes and in certain winds there was that primary clue in the air balance per cent oxygen per cent nitrogen and per cent carbon dioxide with the trace gases taking up the rest there was a rare native root plant that grew above the meter level in the northern temperate zone a tuber two meters long yielded half a liter of water and there were the terraform desert plants the tougher ones showed signs of thriving if planted in depressions lined with dew precipitators then kynes saw the salt pan his thopter flying between stations far out on the bled was blown off course by a storm when the storm passed there was the pan a giant oval depression some three hundred kilometers on the long axis a glaring white surprise in the open desert kynes landed tasted the pans stormcleaned surface salt now he was certain thered been open water on arrakis once he began reexamining the evidence of the dry wells where trickles of water had appeared and vanished never to return kynes set his newly trained fremen limnologists to work their chief clue leathery scraps of matter sometimes found with the spicemass after a blow this had been ascribed to a fictional sandtrout in fremen folk stories as facts grew into evidence a creature emerged to explain these leathery scraps a sandswimmer that blocked off water into fertile pockets within the porous lower strata below the ° absolute line this waterstealer died by the millions in each spiceblow a fivedegree change in temperature could kill it the few survivors entered a semidormant cysthibernation to emerge in six years as small about three meters long sandworms of these only a few avoided their larger brothers and prespice water pockets to emerge into maturity as the giant shaihulud water is poisonous to shaihulud as the fremen had long known from drowning the rare stunted worm of the minor erg to produce the awarenessspectrum narcotic they call water of life the stunted worm is a primitive form of shaihulud that reaches a length of only about nine meters now they had the circular relationship little maker to prespice mass little maker to shaihulud shaihulud to scatter the spice upon which fed microscopic creatures called sand plankton the sand plankton food for shaihulud growing burrowing becoming little makers kynes and his people turned their attention from these great relationships and focused now on microecology first the climate the sand surface often reached temperatures of ° to ° absolute a foot below ground it might be ° cooler a foot above ground ° cooler leaves or black shade could provide another ° of cooling next the nutrients sand of arrakis is mostly a product of worm digestion dust the truly omnipresent problem there is produced by the constant surface creep the saltation movement of sand coarse grains are found on the downwind sides of dunes the windward side is packed smooth and hard old dunes are yellow oxidized young dunes are the color of the parent rock usually gray downwind sides of old dunes provided the first plantation areas the fremen aimed first for a cycle of poverty grass with peatlike hair cilia to intertwine mat and fix the dunes by depriving the wind of its big weapon movable grains adaptive zones were laid out in the deep south far from harkonnen watchers the mutated poverty grasses were planted first along the downwind slipface of the chosen dunes that stood across the path of the prevailing westerlies with the downwind face anchored the windward face grew higher and higher and the grass was moved to keep pace giant sifs long dunes with sinuous crest of more than meters height were produced this way when barrier dunes reached sufficient height the windward faces were planted with tougher sword grasses each structure on a base about six times as thick as its height was anchored fixed now they came in with deeper plantings ephemerals chenopods pigweeds and amaranth to begin then scotch broom low lupine vine eucalyptus the type adapted for caladans northern reaches dwarf tamarisk shore pine then the true desert growths candelilla saguaro and bisnaga the barrel cactus where it would grow they introduced camel sage onion grass gobi feather grass wild alfalfa burrow bush sand verbena evening primrose incense bush smoke tree creosote bush they turned then to the necessary animal life burrowing creatures to open the soil and aerate it kit fox kangaroo mouse desert hare sand terrapin and the predators to keep them in check desert hawk dwarf owl eagle and desert owl and insects to fill the niches these couldnt reach scorpion centipede trapdoor spider the biting wasp and the wormfly and the desert bat to keep watch on these now came the crucial test date palms cotton melons coffee medicinals more than selected food plant types to test and adapt the thing the ecologically illiterate dont realize about an ecosystem kynes said is that its a system a system a system maintains a certain fluid stability that can be destroyed by a misstep in just one niche a system has order a flowing from point to point if something dams that flow order collapses the untrained might miss that collapse until it was too late thats why the highest function of ecology is the understanding of consequences had they achieved a system kynes and his people watched and waited the fremen now knew what he meant by an openend prediction to five hundred years a report came up from the palmaries at the desert edge of the plantings the sand plankton is being poisoned through interaction with the new forms of life the reason protein incompatibility poisonous water was forming there which the arrakis life would not touch a barren zone surrounded the plantings and even shaihulud would not invade it kynes went down to the palmaries himself a twentythumper trip in a palanquin like a wounded man or reverend mother because he never became a sandrider he tested the barren zone it stank to heaven and came up with a bonus a gift from arrakis the addition of sulfur and fixed nitrogen converted the barren zone to a rich plant bed for terraform life the plantings could be advanced at will does this change the timing the fremen asked kynes went back to his planetary formulae windtrap figures were fairly secure by then he was generous with his allowances knowing he couldnt draw neat lines around ecological problems a certain amount of plant cover had to be set aside to hold dunes in place a certain amount for foodstuffs both human and animal a certain amount to lock moisture in root systems and to feed water out into surrounding parched areas theyd mapped the roving cold spots on the open bled by this time these had to be figured into the formulae even shaihulud had a place in the charts he must never be destroyed else spice wealth would end but his inner digestive factory with its enormous concentrations of aldehydes and acids was a giant source of oxygen a medium worm about meters long discharged into the atmosphere as much oxygen as ten square kilometers of green growing photosynthesis surface he had the guild to consider the spice bribe to the guild for preventing weather satellites and other watchers in the skies of arrakis already had reached major proportions nor could the fremen be ignored especially the fremen with their windtraps and irregular landholdings organized around water supply the fremen with their new ecological literacy and their dream of cycling vast areas of arrakis through a prairie phase into forest cover from the charts emerged a figure kynes reported it three per cent if they could get three per cent of the green plant element on arrakis involved in forming carbon compounds theyd have their selfsustaining cycle but how long the fremen demanded oh that about three hundred and fifty years so it was true as this umma had said in the beginning the thing would not come in the lifetime of any man now living nor in the lifetime of their grandchildren eight times removed but it would come the work continued building planting digging training the children then kynestheumma was killed in the cavein at plaster basin by this time his son lietkynes was nineteen a full fremen and sandrider who had killed more than a hundred harkonnens the imperial appointment for which the elder kynes already had applied in the name of his son was delivered as a matter of course the rigid class structure of the faufreluches had its wellordered purpose here the son had been trained to follow the father the course had been set by this time the ecologicalfremen were aimed along their way lietkynes had only to watch and nudge and spy upon the harkonnens until the day his planet was afflicted by a hero appendix ii the religion of dune before the coming of muaddib the fremen of arrakis practiced a religion whose roots in the maometh saari are there for any scholar to see many have traced the extensive borrowings from other religions the most common example is the hymn to water a direct copy from the orange catholic liturgical manual calling for rain clouds which arrakis had never seen but there are more profound points of accord between the kitab alibar of the fremen and the teachings of bible ilm and fiqh any comparison of the religious beliefs dominant in the imperium up to the time of muaddib must start with the major forces which shaped those beliefs the followers of the fourteen sages whose book was the orange catholic bible and whose views are expressed in the commentaries and other literature produced by the commission of ecumenical translators cet the bene gesserit who privately denied they were a religious order but who operated behind an almost impenetrable screen of ritual mysticism and whose training whose symbolism organization and internal teaching methods were almost wholly religious the agnostic ruling class including the guild for whom religion was a kind of puppet show to amuse the populace and keep it docile and who believed essentially that all phenomena even religious phenomena could be reduced to mechanical explanations the socalled ancient teachings including those preserved by the zensunni wanderers from the first second and third islamic movements the navachristianity of chusuk the buddislamic variants of the types dominant at lankiveil and sikun the blend books of the mahayana lankavatara the zen hekiganshu of iii delta pavonis the tawrah and talmudic zabur surviving on salusa secundus the pervasive obeah ritual the muadh quran with its pure ilm and fiqh preserved among the pundi rice farmers of caladan the hindu outcroppings found all through the universe in little pockets of insulated pyons and finally the butlerian jihad there is a fifth force which shaped religious belief but its effect is so universal and profound that it deserves to stand alone this is of course space travel and in any discussion of religion it deserves to be written thus space travel mankinds movement through deep space placed a unique stamp on religion during the one hundred and ten centuries that preceded the butlerian jihad to begin with early space travel although widespread was largely unregulated slow and uncertain and before the guild monopoly was accomplished by a hodgepodge of methods the first space experiences poorly communicated and subject to extreme distortion were a wild inducement to mystical speculation immediately space gave a different flavor and sense to ideas of creation that difference is seen even in the highest religious achievements of the period all through religion the feeling of the sacred was touched by anarchy from the outer dark it was as though jupiter in all his descendant forms retreated into the maternal darkness to be superseded by a female immanence filled with ambiguity and with a face of many terrors the ancient formulae intertwined tangled together as they were fitted to the needs of new conquests and new heraldic symbols it was a time of struggle between beastdemons on the one side and the old prayers and invocations on the other there was never a clear decision during this period it was said that genesis was reinterpreted permitting god to say increase and multiply and fill the universe and subdue it and rule over all manner of strange beasts and living creatures in the infinite airs on the infinite earths and beneath them it was a time of sorceresses whose powers were real the measure of them is seen in the fact they never boasted how they grasped the firebrand then came the butlerian jihad two generations of chaos the god of machinelogic was overthrown among the masses and a new concept was raised man may not be replaced those two generations of violence were a thalamic pause for all humankind men looked at their gods and their rituals and saw that both were filled with that most terrible of all equations fear over ambition hesitantly the leaders of religions whose followers had spilled the blood of billions began meeting to exchange views it was a move encouraged by the spacing guild which was beginning to build its monopoly over all interstellar travel and by the bene gesserit who were banding the sorceresses out of those first ecumenical meetings came two major developments the realization that all religions had at least one common commandment thou shall not disfigure the soul the commission of ecumenical translators cet convened on a neutral island of old earth spawning ground of the mother religions they met in the common belief that there exists a divine essence in the universe every faith with more than a million followers was represented and they reached a surprisingly immediate agreement on the statement of their common goal we are here to remove a primary weapon from the hands of disputant religions that weapon the claim to possession of the one and only revelation jubilation at this sign of profound accord proved premature for more than a standard year that statement was the only announcement from cet men spoke bitterly of the delay troubadours composed witty biting songs about the one hundred and twentyone old cranks as the cet delegates came to be called the name arose from a ribald joke which played on the cet initials and called the delegates crankseffingturners one of the songs brown repose has undergone periodic revival and is popular even today consider leis brown repose and the tragedy in all of those cranks all those cranks so laze so laze through all your days time has tolld for mlord sandwich occasional rumors leaked out of the cet sessions it was said they were comparing texts and irresponsibly the texts were named such rumors inevitably provoked antiecumenism riots and of course inspired new witticisms two years passed three years the commissioners nine of their original number having died and been replaced paused to observe formal installation of the replacements and announced they were laboring to produce one book weeding out all the pathological symptoms of the religious past we are producing an instrument of love to be played in all ways they said many consider it odd that this statement provoked the worst outbreaks of violence against ecumenism twenty delegates were recalled by their congregations one committed suicide by stealing a space frigate and diving it into the sun historians estimate the riots took eighty million lives that works out to about six thousand for each world then in the landsraad league considering the unrest of the time this may not be an excessive estimate although any pretense to real accuracy in the figure must be just that pretense communication between worlds was at one of its lowest ebbs the troubadours quite naturally had a field day a popular musical comedy of the period had one of the cet delegates sitting on a white sand beach beneath a palm tree singing for god woman and the splendor of love we dally here sans fears or cares troubadour troubadour sing another melody for god woman and the splendor of love riots and comedy are but symptoms of the times profoundly revealing they betray the psychological tone the deep uncertainties and the striving for something better plus the fear that nothing would come of it all the major dams against anarchy in these times were the embryo guild the bene gesserit and the landsraad which continued its year record of meeting in spite of the severest obstacles the guilds part appears clear they gave free transport for all landsraad and cet business the bene gesserit role is more obscure certainly this is the time in which they consolidated their hold upon the sorceresses explored the subtle narcotics developed pranabindu training and conceived the missionaria protectiva that black arm of superstition but it is also the period that saw the composing of the litany against fear and the assembly of the azhar book that bibliographic marvel that preserves the great secrets of the most ancient faiths ingsleys comment is perhaps the only one possible those were times of deep paradox for almost seven years then cet labored and as their seventh anniversary approached they prepared the human universe for a momentous announcement on that seventh anniversary they unveiled the orange catholic bible here is a work with dignity and meaning they said here is a way to make humanity aware of itself as a total creation of god the men of cet were likened to archeologists of ideas inspired by god in the grandeur of rediscovery it was said they had brought to light the vitality of great ideals overlaid by the deposits of centuries that they had sharpened the moral imperatives that come out of a religious conscience with the oc bible cet presented the liturgical manual and the commentaries in many respects a more remarkable work not only because of its brevity less than half the size of the oc bible but also because of its candor and blend of selfpity and selfrighteousness the beginning is an obvious appeal to the agnostic rulers men finding no answers to the sunnan the ten thousand religious questions from the shariah now apply their own reasoning all men seek to be enlightened religion is but the most ancient and honorable way in which men have striven to make sense out of gods universe scientists seek the lawfulness of events it is the task of religion to fit man into this lawfulness in their conclusion though the commentaries set a harsh tone that very likely foretold their fate much that was called religion has carried an unconscious attitude of hostility toward life true religion must teach that life is filled with joys pleasing to the eye of god that knowledge without action is empty all men must see that the teaching of religion by rules and rote is largely a hoax the proper teaching is recognized with ease you can know it without fail because it awakens within you that sensation which tells you this is something youve always known there was an odd sense of calm as the presses and shigawire imprinters rolled and the oc bible spread out through the worlds some interpreted this as a sign from god an omen of unity but even the cet delegates betrayed the fiction of that calm as they returned to their respective congregations eighteen of them were lynched within two months fiftythree recanted within the year the oc bible was denounced as a work produced by the hubris of reason it was said that its pages were filled with a seductive interest in logic revisions that catered to popular bigotry began appearing these revisions leaned on accepted symbolisms cross crescent feather rattle the twelve saints the thin buddha and the like and it soon became apparent that the ancient superstitions and beliefs had not been absorbed by the new ecumenism halloways label for cets sevenyear effort galactophasic determinism was snapped up by eager billions who interpreted the initials gd as goddamned cet chairman toure bomoko an ulema of the zensunnis and one of the fourteen delegates who never recanted the fourteen sages of popular history appeared to admit finally the cet had erred we shouldnt have tried to create new symbols he said we shouldve realized we werent supposed to introduce uncertainties into accepted belief that we werent supposed to stir up curiosity about god we are daily confronted by the terrifying instability of all things human yet we permit our religions to grow more rigid and controlled more conforming and oppressive what is this shadow across the highway of divine command it is a warning that institutions endure that symbols endure when their meaning is lost that there is no summa of all attainable knowledge the bitter double edge in this admission did not escape bomokos critics and he was forced soon afterward to flee into exile his life dependent upon the guilds pledge of secrecy he reportedly died on tupile honored and beloved his last words religion must remain an outlet for people who say to themselves i am not the kind of person i want to be it must never sink into an assemblage of the selfsatisfied it is pleasant to think that bomoko understood the prophecy in his words institutions endure ninety generations later the oc bible and the commentaries permeated the religious universe when paulmuaddib stood with his right hand on the rock shrine enclosing his fathers skull the right hand of the blessed not the left hand of the damned he quoted word for word from bomokos legacy you who have defeated us say to yourselves that babylon is fallen and its works have been overturned i say to you still that man remains on trial each man in his own dock each man is a little war the fremen said of muaddib that he was like abu zide whose frigate defied the guild and rode one day there and back there used in this way translates directly from the fremen mythology as the land of the ruhspirit the alam almithal where all limitations are removed the parallel between this and the kwisatz haderach is readily seen the kwisatz haderach that the sisterhood sought through its breeding program was interpreted as the shortening of the way or the one who can be two places simultaneously but both of these interpretations can be shown to stem directly from the commentaries when law and religious duty are one your selfdom encloses the universe of himself muaddib said i am a net in the sea of time free to sweep future and past i am a moving membrane from whom no possibility can escape these thoughts are all one and the same and they harken to kalima in the oc bible where it says whether a thought is spoken or not it is a real thing and has powers of reality it is when we get into muaddibs own commentaries in the pillars of the universe as interpreted by his holy men the qizara tafwid that we see his real debt to cet and fremenzensunni muaddib law and duty are one so be it but remember these limitations thus are you never fully selfconscious thus do you remain immersed in the communal tau thus are you always less than an individual oc bible identical wording revelations muaddib religion often partakes of the myth of progress that shields us from the terrors of an uncertain future cet commentaries identical wording the azhar book traces this statement to the first century religious writer neshou through a paraphrase muaddib if a child an untrained person an ignorant person or an insane person incites trouble it is the fault of authority for not predicting and preventing that trouble oc bible any sin can be ascribed at least in part to a natural bad tendency that is an extenuating circumstance acceptable to god the azhar book traces this to the ancient semitic tawra muaddib reach forth thy hand and eat what god has provided thee and when thou are replenished praise the lord oc bible a paraphrase with identical meaning the azhar book traces this in slightly different form to first islam muaddib kindness is the beginning of cruelty fremen kitab alibar the weight of a kindly god is a fearful thing did not god give us the burning sun allat did not god give us the mothers of moisture reverend mothers did not god give us shaitan iblis satan from shaitan did we not get the hurtfulness of speed this is the source of the fremen saying speed comes from shaitan consider for every one hundred calories of heat generated by exercise speed the body evaporates about six ounces of perspiration the fremen word for perspiration is bakka or tears and in one pronunciation translates the life essence that shaitan squeezes from your soul muaddibs arrival is called religiously timely by koneywell but timing had little to do with it as muaddib himself said i am here so it is however vital to an understanding of muaddibs religious impact that you never lose sight of one fact the fremen were a desert people whose entire ancestry was accustomed to hostile landscapes mysticism isnt difficult when you survive each second by surmounting open hostility you are there so with such a tradition suffering is accepted perhaps as unconscious punishment but accepted and its well to note that fremen ritual gives almost complete freedom from guilt feelings this isnt necessarily because their law and religion were identical making disobedience a sin its likely closer to the mark to say they cleansed themselves of guilt easily because their everyday existence required brutal judgments often deadly which in a softer land would burden men with unbearable guilt this is likely one of the roots of fremen emphasis on superstition disregarding the missionaria protectivas ministrations what matter that whistling sands are an omen what matter that you must make the sign of the fist when first you see first moon a mans flesh is his own and his water belongs to the tribe and the mystery of life isnt a problem to solve but a reality to experience omens help you remember this and because you are here because you have the religion victory can not evade you in the end as the bene gesserit taught for centuries long before they ran afoul of the fremen when religion and politics ride the same cart when that cart is driven by a living holy man baraka nothing can stand in their path appendix iii report on bene gesserit motives and purposes here follows an excerpt from the summa prepared by her own agents at the request of the lady jessica immediately after the arrakis affair the candor of this report amplifies its value far beyond the ordinary because the bene gesserit operated for centuries behind the blind of a semimystic school while carrying on their selective breeding program among humans we tend to award them with more status than they appear to deserve analysis of their trial of fact on the arrakis affair betrays the schools profound ignorance of its own role it may be argued that the bene gesserit could examine only such facts as were available to them and had no direct access to the person of the prophet muaddib but the school had surmounted greater obstacles and its error here goes deeper the bene gesserit program had as its target the breeding of a person they labeled kwisatz haderach a term signifying one who can be many places at once in simpler terms what they sought was a human with mental powers permitting him to understand and use higher order dimensions they were breeding for a supermentat a human computer with some of the prescient abilities found in guild navigators now attend these facts carefully muaddib born paul atreides was the son of the duke leto a man whose bloodline had been watched carefully for more than a thousand years the prophets mother lady jessica was a natural daughter of the baron vladimir harkonnen and carried genemarkers whose supreme importance to the breeding program was known for almost two thousand years she was a bene gesserit bred and trained and should have been a willing tool of the project the lady jessica was ordered to produce an atreides daughter the plan was to inbreed this daughter with feydrautha harkonnen a nephew of the baron vladimir with the high probability of a kwisatz haderach from that union instead for reasons she confesses have never been completely clear to her the concubine lady jessica defied her orders and bore a son this alone should have alerted the bene gesserit to the possibility that a wild variable had entered their scheme but there were other far more important indications that they virtually ignored as a youth paul atreides showed ability to predict the future he was known to have had prescient visions that were accurate penetrating and defied fourdimensional explanation the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam bene gesserit proctor who tested pauls humanity when he was fifteen deposes that he surmounted more agony in the test than any other human of record yet she failed to make special note of this in her report when family atreides moved to the planet arrakis the fremen population there hailed the young paul as a prophet the voice from the outer world the bene gesserit were well aware that the rigors of such a planet as arrakis with its totality of desert landscape its absolute lack of open water its emphasis on the most primitive necessities for survival inevitably produces a high proportion of sensitives yet this fremen reaction and the obvious element of the arrakeen diet high in spice were glossed over by bene gesserit observers when the harkonnens and the soldierfanatics of the padishah emperor reoccupied arrakis killing pauls father and most of the atreides troops paul and his mother disappeared but almost immediately there were reports of a new religious leader among the fremen a man called muaddib who again was hailed as the voice from the outer world the reports stated clearly that he was accompanied by a new reverend mother of the sayyadina rite who is the woman who bore him records available to the bene gesserit stated in plain terms that the fremen legends of the prophet contained these words he shall be born of a bene gesserit witch it may be argued here that the bene gesserit sent their missionaria protectiva onto arrakis centuries earlier to implant something like this legend as safeguard should any members of the school be trapped there and require sanctuary and that this legend of the voice from the outer world was properly to be ignored because it appeared to be the standard bene gesserit ruse but this would be true only if you granted that the bene gesserit were correct in ignoring the other clues about paulmuaddib when the arrakis affair boiled up the spacing guild made overtures to the bene gesserit the guild hinted that its navigators who use the spice drug of arrakis to produce the limited prescience necessary for guiding spaceships through the void were bothered about the future or saw problems on the horizon this could only mean they saw a nexus a meeting place of countless delicate decisions beyond which the path was hidden from the prescient eye this was a clear indication that some agency was interfering with higher order dimensions a few of the bene gesserit had long been aware that the guild could not interfere directly with the vital spice source because guild navigators already were dealing in their own inept way with higher order dimensions at least to the point where they recognized that the slightest misstep they made on arrakis could be catastrophic it was a known fact that guild navigators could predict no way to take control of the spice without producing just such a nexus the obvious conclusion was that someone of higher order powers was taking control of the spice source yet the bene gesserit missed this point entirely in the face of these facts one is led to the inescapable conclusion that the inefficient bene gesserit behavior in this affair was a product of an even higher plan of which they were completely unaware appendix iv the almanak enashraf selected excerpts of the noble houses shaddam iv the padishah emperor st of his line house corrino to occupy the golden lion throne reigned from
