the chronicles of prydain book two the black cauldron lloyd alexander authors note the following pages are intended hopefully to do somewhat more than continue the chronicles of prydain what happens next is always an urgent question and this volume attempts to answer it at least partially nevertheless the black cauldron should stand as a chronicle in its own right certain matters previously hinted at are here revealed more fully and while extending the story i have also tried to deepen it if a darker thread runs through the high spirits it is because the happenings are of serious import not only to the land of prydain but to taran the assistant pigkeeper himself although an imaginary world prydain is essentially not too different from our real one where humor and heartbreak joy and sadness are closely interwoven the choices and decisions that face a frequently baffled assistant pigkeeper are no easier than the ones we ourselves must make even in a fantasy realm growing up is accomplished not without cost readers venturing into this kingdom for the first time should also be warned that the landscape at first glance may seem like wales and the inhabitants may evoke heroes of ancient welsh legend these were the roots and inspiration but the rest is a work of imagination similar only in spirit not in detail readers who have already journeyed with taran are assured and this without giving away any surprises that gurgi despite shakings and quakings and fears for his poor tender head insisted on joining this new adventure as did the impetuous fflewddur fflam and the disgruntled doli of the fair folk as for the princess eilonwy daughter of angharad there can be no question i have been happy to learn that taran in spite of his faults has gained some steadfast companions beyond the borders of prydain beverly bond whose courage never faltered zay borman who rashly visited the marshes of morva during a thunderstorm carl brandt who was sure prydain existed even before it was discovered ann durell from the very beginning max jacobson my severe friend and best critic evaline ness of clearest vision louise waller who helped weed dandelions and evan and reed kris and mike fleur suzy and barbara peter liz and susie michael mark gary and diana and their respective parents to them these pages are affectionately offered la chapter the council at caer dallben autumn had come too swiftly in the northernmost realms of prydain many trees were already leafless and among the branches clung the ragged shapes of empty nests to the south across the river great avren the hills shielded caer dallben from the winds but even here the little farm was drawing in on itself for taran the summer was ending before it had begun that morning dallben had given him the task of washing the oracular pig had the old enchanter ordered him to capture a fullgrown gwythaint taran would gladly have set out after one of the vicious winged creatures as it was he filled the bucket at the well and trudged reluctantly to hen wens enclosure the white pig usually eager for a bath now squealed nervously and rolled on her back in the mud busy struggling to raise hen wen to her feet taran did not notice the horseman until he had reined up at the pen you there pigboy the rider looking down at him was a youth only a few years older than taran his hair was tawny his eyes black and deepset in a pale arrogant face though of excellent quality his garments had seen much wear and his cloak was purposely draped to hide his threadbare attire the cloak itself taran saw had been neatly and painstakingly mended he sat astride a roan mare a lean and nervous steed speckled red and yellow with a long narrow head whose expression was as illtempered as her masters you pigboy he repeated is this caer dallben the horsemans tone and bearing nettled taran but he curbed his temper and bowed courteously it is he replied but i am not a pigboy he added i am taran assistant pigkeeper a pig is a pig said the stranger and a pigboy is a pigboy run and tell your master i am here he ordered tell him that prince ellidyr son of penllarcau hen wen seized this opportunity to roll into another puddle stop that hen taran cried hurrying after her leave off with that sow ellidyr commanded did you not hear me do as i say and be quick about it tell dallben yourself taran called over his shoulder trying to keep hen wen from the mud or wait until ive done with my own work mind your impudence ellidyr answered or you shall have a good beating for it taran flushed leaving hen wen to do as she pleased he strode quickly to the railing and climbed over if i do he answered hotly throwing back his head and looking ellidyr full in the face it will not be at your hands ellidyr gave a scornful laugh before taran could spring aside the roan plunged forward ellidyr leaning from the saddle seized taran by the front of the jacket taran flailed his arms and legs vainly strong as he was he could not break free he was pummeled and shaken until his teeth rattled ellidyr then urged the roan into a gallop hauled taran across the turf to the cottage and there while chickens scattered in every direction tossed him roughly to the ground the commotion brought dallben and coll outdoors the princess eilonwy hurried from the scullery her apron flying and a cookpot still in her hand with a cry of alarm she ran to tarans side ellidyr without troubling to dismount called to the white bearded enchanter are you dallben i have brought your pigboy to be thrashed for his insolence tut said dallben unperturbed by ellidyrs furious expression whether he is insolent is one thing and whether he should be thrashed is another in either case i need no suggestions from you i am a prince of penllarcau cried ellidyr yes yes yes dallben interrupted with a wave of his brittle hand i am quite aware of all that and too busy to be concerned with it go water your horse and your temper at the same time you shall be called when you are wanted ellidyr was about to reply but the enchanters stern glance made him hold his tongue he turned the roan and urged her toward the stable princess eilonwy and the stout baldheaded coll meantime had been helping taran pick himself up you should know better my boy than to quarrel with strangers said coll goodnaturedly thats true enough eilonwy added especially if theyre on horseback and youre on foot next time i meet him taran began when you meet again said dallben you at least shall conduct yourself with as much restraint and dignity as possible which i allow may not be very great but you shall have to make do with it be off now the princess eilonwy can help you to be a little more presentable than you are at the moment in the lowest of spirits taran followed the goldenhaired girl to the scullery he still smarted more from ellidyrs words than from the drubbing and he was hardly pleased that eilonwy had seen him sprawled at the feet of the arrogant prince however did it happen eilonwy asked picking up a damp cloth and applying it to tarans face taran did not answer but glumly submitted to her care before eilonwy had finished a hairy figure covered with leaves and twigs popped up at the window and with great agility clambered over the sill woe and sadness the creature wailed loping anxiously to taran gurgi sees smackings and whackings by strengthful lord poor kindly master gurgi is sorry for him but there is news gurgi hurried on good news gurgi also sees mightiest of princes riding yes yes with great gallopings on white horse with black sword what joy whats that cried taran do you mean prince gwydion it cant be it is said a voice behind him gwydion stood in the doorway with a shout of amazement taran ran forward and clasped his hand eilonwy threw her arms about the tall warrior while gurgi joyfully pounded the floor the last time taran had seen him gwydion wore the raiment of a prince of the royal house of don now he was dressed simply in a hooded cloak of gray and a coarse unadorned jacket the black sword dyrnwyn hung at his side well met all of you said gwydion gurgi looks as hungry as ever eilonwy prettier than ever and you assistant pigkeeper he added his lined and weathered face breaking into a smile a little the worse for wear dallben has mentioned how you came by those bruises i sought no quarrel taran declared but one found you nonetheless gwydion said i think that must be the way of it with you taran of caer dallben no matter he said stepping back and studying taran closely through greenflecked eyes let me look at you you have grown since last we met gwydion nodded his shaggy wolfgray head in approval i hope you have gained as much wisdom as height we shall see now i must make ready for the council council taran cried dallben said nothing of a council he did not even say you were coming here the truth is eilonwy put in dallben hasnt been saying much of anything to anybody you should understand by now said gwydion that of what he knows dallben tells little yes there is to be a council and i have summoned others to meet us here i am old enough to sit in a council of men taran interrupted excitedly i have learned much i have fought at your side i have gently gently gwydion said we have agreed you shall have a place though manhood he added softly with a trace of sadness may not be all that you believe gwydion put his hands on tarans shoulders meanwhile stand ready your task will be given soon enough as gwydion had foretold the rest of the morning brought many new arrivals a company of horsemen soon appeared and began to make camp in the stubble field beyond the orchard the warriors taran saw were armed for battle his heart leaped surely this too had to do with gwydions council his head spun with questions and he hurried toward the field he had not gone halfway when he stopped short in great surprise two familiar figures were riding up the pathway taran raced to meet them fflewddur he called while the bard his beautiful harp slung over his shoulder raised a hand in greeting and doli is that really you the crimsonhaired dwarf swung down from his pony he grinned broadly for an instant then assumed his customary scowl he did not however conceal the glint of pleasure in his round red eyes doli taran clapped the dwarf on the back i never thought id see you again that is really see you not after you gained the power to be invisible humph snorted the leatherjacketed dwarf invisible ive had all i want of that do you realize the effort it takes terrible it makes my ears ring and thats not the worst of it nobody can see you so you get your toes stepped on or an elbow jabbed in your eye no no not for me i cant stand it any more and you fflewddur taran cried as the bard dismounted ive missed you do you know what the council is about thats why youre here isnt it and doli too i know nothing about councils muttered doli king eiddileg commanded me to come here a special favor to gwydion but i can tell you right now id rather be back home in the realm of the fair folk minding my own business in my case said the bard gwydion happened to be passing through my kingdom purely by chance it seemed though now im beginning to think it wasnt he suggested i might enjoy stopping down at caer dallben he said good old doli was going to be there so of course i set out immediately id given up being a bard fflewddur continued and had settled quite happily as a king again really it was only to oblige gwydion at this two strings of his harp snapped with a resounding twang fflewddur stopped immediately and cleared his throat yes well he added the truth of it is i was perfectly miserable id have taken any excuse to get out of that damp dismal castle for a while a council you say i was hoping it might be a harvest festival and id be needed to provide the entertainment whatever it is taran said im glad youre both here im not grumbled the dwarf when they start talking about good old doli this and good old doli that watch out its for something disagreeable as they made their way to the cottage fflewddur looked around with interest well well do i see king smoits banner over there hes here at gwydions request too ive no doubt just then a horseman cantered up and called to fflewddur by name the bard gave a cry of pleasure thats adaon son of the chief bard taliesin he told taran caer dallben is indeed honored today the rider dismounted and fflewddur hastened to present his companions to him adaon taran saw was tall with straight black hair that fell to his shoulders though of noble bearing he wore the garb of an ordinary warrior with no ornament save a curiously shaped iron brooch at his collar his eyes were gray strangely deep clear as a flame and taran sensed that little was hidden from adaons thoughtful and searching glance well met taran of caer dallben and doli of the fair folk said adaon clasping their hands in turn your names are not unknown among the bards of the north then you too are a bard asked taran bowing with great respect adaon smiled and shook his head many times my father has asked me to present myself for initiation but i choose to wait there is still much i hope to learn and in my own heart i do not feel myself ready one day perhaps i shall be adaon turned to fflewddur my father sends greetings and asks how you fare with the harp he gave you i can see it wants repair he added with a friendly laugh yes admitted fflewddur i do have trouble with it now and again i cant help ah adding a little color to the facts most facts need it so badly but every time i do he sighed looking at the two broken strings this is the result be of good cheer said adaon laughing wholeheartedly your gallant tales are worth all the harp strings in prydain and you taran and doli must promise to tell me more of your famous deeds but first i must find lord gwydion taking leave of the companions adaon mounted and rode on ahead fflewddur looked after him with affection and admiration it can be no small matter if adaon is here he said he is one of the bravest men i know that and more for he has the heart of a true bard someday he will surely be our greatest you can mark my words and our names are indeed known to him taran asked and there have been songs about us fflewddur beamed after our battle with the horned king yes i did compose a little something a modest offering but its gratifying to know it has spread as soon as i fix these wretched strings ill be delighted to let you hear it soon after midday when all had refreshed themselves coll summoned them to dallbens chamber there a long table had been placed with seats on either side taran noticed the enchanter had even made some attempt at straightening up the disorder of ancient volumes crowding the room the book of three the heavy tome filled with dallbens deepest secrets had been set carefully at the top of a shelf taran glanced up at it almost fearfully sure that it held far more than dallben ever chose to reveal the rest of the company had begun to enter when fflewddur took tarans arm and drew him aside as a dark bearded warrior swept by one thing you can be sure of the bard said under his breath gwydion isnt planning a harvest festival do you see whos here the dark warrior was more richly attired than any of the company his highbridged nose was falconlike his eyes heavylidded but keen only to gwydion did he bow then taking a seat at the table he cast a cool glance of appraisal on those around him who is he whispered taran not daring to stare at this proud and regal figure king morgant of madoc answered the bard the boldest war leader in prydain second only to gwydion himself he owes allegiance to the house of don he shook his head in admiration they say he once saved gwydions life i believe it ive seen that fellow in battle all ice absolutely fearless if morgants to have a hand in this something interesting must be stirring oh listen its king smoit you can always hear him before you can see him a bellow of laughter resounded beyond the chamber and in another moment a giant redheaded warrior rolled in at the side of adaon he towered above all in the chamber and his beard flamed around a face so scarred with old wounds it was impossible to tell where one began and another ended his nose had been battered to his cheekbones his heavy forehead was nearly lost in a fierce tangle of eyebrows and his neck seemed as thick as tarans waist what a bear said fflewddur with an affectionate chuckle but theres not a grain of harm in him when the lords of the southern cantrevs rose against the sons of don smoit was one of the few who stayed loyal his kingdom is cantrev cadiffor smoit stopped in the middle of the chamber threw back his cloak and hooked his thumbs into the enormous bronze belt which strained to bursting about his middle hullo morgant he roared so theyve called you in have they he sniffed ferociously i smell bloodletting in the wind he strode up to the stern war leader and fetched him a heavy clout on the shoulder have a care said morgant with a lean smile that showed only the tips of his teeth that it will not be yours ho oho king smoit bellowed and slapped his massive thighs very good have a care it will not be mine never fear you icicle i have enough to spare he caught sight of fflewddur and another old comrade he roared hurrying to the bard and flinging his arms about him with such enthusiasm that taran heard fflewddurs ribs creak my pulse cried smoit my body and bones give us a tune to make us merry you butterheaded harpscraper his eye fell on taran whats this whats this he seized taran with a mighty redfurred hand a skinned rabbit a plucked chicken he is taran dallbens assistant pigkeeper said the bard i wish he were dallbens cook cried smoit ive hardly lined my belly dallben began to rap for silence smoit strode to his place after giving fflewddur another hug there may not be any harm in him said taran to the bard but i think its safer to have him for a friend all the company now gathered at the table with dallben and gwydion at one end coll at the other king smoit overflowing his chair sat on the enchanters left across from king morgant taran squeezed in between the bard and doli who grumbled bitterly about the table being too high to the right of morgant sat adaon and beside him ellidyr whom taran had not seen since morning dallben rose and stood quietly a moment all turned toward him the enchanter pulled on a wisp of beard i am much too old to be polite dallben said and i have no intention of making a speech of welcome our business here is urgent and we shall get down to it immediately little more than a year ago as some of you have good cause to remember dallben went on glancing at taran and his companions arawn lord of annuvin suffered grave defeat when the horned king his champion was slain for a time the power of the land of death was checked but in prydain evil is never distant none of us is foolish enough to believe arawn would accept a defeat without challenge dallben continued i had hoped for a little more time to ponder the new threat of annuvin time alas will not be granted arawns plans have become all too clear of them i ask lord gwydion to speak gwydion rose in turn his face was grave who has not heard of the cauldronborn the mute and deathless warriors who serve the lord of annuvin these are the stolen bodies of the slain steeped in arawns cauldron to give them life again they emerge implacable as death itself their humanity forgotten indeed they are no longer men but weapons of murder in thrall to arawn forever in this loathsome work gwydion went on arawn has sought to despoil the graves and barrows of fallen warriors now throughout prydain there have been strange disappearances men suddenly vanishing to be seen no more and cauldronborn appear where none has ever before been sighted arawn has not been idle as i have now learned his servants dare to strike down the living and bear them to annuvin to swell the ranks of his deathless host thus death begets death evil begets evil taran shuddered outdoors the forest burned crimson and yellow the air was gentle as though a summer day had lingered beyond its season but gwydions words chilled him like a sudden cold wind too well he remembered the lifeless eyes and livid faces of the cauldronborn their ghastly silence and ruthless swords to the meat of it cried smoit are we rabbits are we to fear these cauldron slaves there will be meat enough for you to chew on answered gwydion with a grim smile i tell you now none of us has ever set on a more perilous task i ask your help for i mean to attack annuvin itself to seize arawns cauldron and destroy it chapter the naming of the tasks taran started from his chair the chamber was utterly silent king smoit about to say something remained openmouthed only king morgant showed no sign of amazement he sat motionless eyes hooded a curious expression on his face there is no other way said gwydion while the cauldronborn can not be slain we must prevent their number from growing between the power of annuvin and our own strength the balance is too fine as he gathers fresh warriors to him arawn reaches his hands closer to our throats nor do i forget the living foully murdered and doomed to bondage even more foul until this day gwydion continued only the high king math and a few others have known what has been in my mind now that you have all heard you are free to go or stay as it pleases you should you choose to return to your cantrevs i will not deem your courage less but i will shouted smoit any wheyblooded puddingguts who fears to stand with you will have me to deal with smoit my friend replied gwydion firmly but with affection this is a choice to be made without persuasion from you no one stirred gwydion looked around and then nodded with satisfaction you do not disappoint me he said i had counted on each of you for tasks which will be clear later tarans excitement crowded out his fear of the cauldronborn it was all he could do to swallow his impatience and not ask gwydion then and there what his task would be for once he wisely held his tongue instead it was fflewddur who leaped to his feet of course cried the bard i saw the whole thing immediately youll need warriors naturally to fetch out that disgusting cauldron but youll need a bard to compose the heroic chants of victory i accept delighted i chose you gwydion said not unkindly more for your sword than for your harp hows that asked fflewddur his brow wrinkled in disappointment oh i see he added brightening yes well i dont deny a certain reputation along those lines a fflam is always valiant ive slashed my way through thousands he glanced uneasily at the harp well ah shall we say numerous enemies i hope you will all be as eager to accomplish your tasks once they are set out said gwydion drawing a sheet of parchment from his jacket and spreading it on the table we meet at caer dallben not only for safety he went on dallben is the most powerful enchanter in prydain and here we are under his protection caer dallben is the one place arawn dares not attack but it is also the most suitable to begin our journey to annuvin with a finger he traced a direction northwest from the little farm great avren is shallow at this season he said and may be crossed without difficulty once across it is an easy progress through cantrev cadiffor realm of king smoit to the forest of idris lying south of annuvin from there we can go quickly to dark gate taran caught his breath like all the company he had heard of dark gate the twin mountains guarding the southern approach to the land of death though not as mighty as mount dragon at the north of annuvin dark gate was treacherous with its sharp crags and hidden drops it is a difficult passage gwydion continued but the least guarded as coll son of collfrewr will tell you coll rose to his feet the old warrior with his shining bald head and huge hands looked as if he would prefer battle to discoursing in council nevertheless he grinned broadly at the company and began to speak we are going as you might say through arawns back door the cauldron stands on a platform in the hall of warriors which is just beyond dark gate as i well remember the entrance to the hall is guarded but there is a rear portal heavily bolted one man might open it to others if like doli he could move unseen i told you i wouldnt like it doli muttered to taran this business of turning invisible gift a curse look where it leads humph the dwarf snorted irritably but made no further protest it is a bold plan gwydion said but with bold companions it can succeed at dark gate we shall divide into three bands the first shall number doli of the fair folk coll son of collfrewr fflewddur fflam son of godo and myself with us will be six of king morgants strongest and most valiant warriors doli invisible will enter first to draw the bolts and to tell us how arawns guards are posted then we shall breach the portal and seize the cauldron at the same time on my signal the second band of king morgant and his horsemen will attack dark gate seemingly in great strength to sow confusion and to draw away as many of arawns forces as possible king morgant nodded and for the first time spoke his voice though iceedged was measured and courteous i rejoice that we at last decide to strike directly against arawn i myself would have undertaken to do so long before this but i was bound to await the command of lord gwydion but now i say this continued morgant while your plan is sound the path you choose is not suitable for quick retreat should arawn pursue you there is no shorter way to caer dallben gwydion answered and here is where the cauldron must be brought we must accept the risk however if we are too sharply pressed we shall take refuge at caer cadarn stronghold of king smoit to this end i ask king smoit to stand ready with all his warriors near the forest of idris what roared smoit keep me from annuvin he struck the table with his fist do you leave me sucking my thumbs let morgant that blackbearded coldblooded slipperyscaled pike play rear guard morgant gave no sign of having heard smoits outburst gwydion shook his head our success depends on surprise and swift movement not numbers you smoit must be our firm support should our plans go awry your task is no less important the third band will await us near dark gate to guard our pack animals secure our retreat and to serve as the need demands they will be adaon son of taliesin taran of caer dallben and ellidyr son of penllarcau ellidyrs voice rose quickly and angrily why must i be held back am i no better than a pigboy he is untried a green apple untried taran shouted springing to his feet i have stood against the cauldronborn with gwydion himself have you been better tried prince patchcloak ellidyrs hand flew to his sword i am a son of penllarcau and swallow no insults from silence commanded gwydion in this venture the courage of an assistant pigkeeper weighs as much as that of a prince i warn you ellidyr curb your temper or leave this council and you gwydion added turning to taran you have repaid anger with a childish insult i had thought better of you moreover both of you shall obey adaon in my absence taran flushed and sat down ellidyr too took his place again his face dark and brooding let us end our meeting said gwydion i shall speak with each of you later and at more length now i have matters to discuss with coll at dawn tomorrow be ready to ride for annuvin as the company began leaving the chamber taran stepped beside ellidyr and held out his hand in this task we must not be enemies speak for yourself ellidyr answered i have no wish to serve with an insolent pigboy i am a kings son whose son are you so you have stood against the cauldronborn he scoffed and with gwydion you lost no chance to make that known you boast of your name taran replied i take pride in my comrades your friendship with gwydion is no shield to me said ellidyr let him favor you all he chooses but hear me well in my company you will take your own part i shall take my own part taran said his anger rising see that you take yours as boldly as you speak adaon had come up beside them gently friends he laughed i had thought the battle was against arawn not among ourselves he spoke quietly but his voice held a tone of command as he turned his glance from taran to ellidyr we hold each others lives in our open hands not in clenched fists taran bowed his head ellidyr drawing his mended cloak about him stalked from the chamber without a word as taran was about to follow adaon dallben called him back you are an excellent pair of hotbloods the enchanter remarked i have been trying to decide which of you is the more muddled it is not easy he yawned i shall have to meditate on it ellidyr spoke the truth taran said bitterly whose son am i i have no name but the one you gave me ellidyr is a prince prince he may be said dallben yet perhaps not so fortunate as you he is the youngest son of old penllarcau in the northern lands his elder brothers have inherited what little there was of family fortune and even that is gone ellidyr has only his name and his sword though i admit he uses them both with something less than wisdom however dallben went on these things have a way of righting themselves oh before i forget his robe flapping around his spindly legs dallben made his way to a huge chest unlocked it with an ancient key and raised the lid he bent and rummaged inside i confess to a certain number of regrets and misgivings he said which could not possibly interest you so i shall not burden you with them on the other hand here is something i am sure will interest you and burden you too for the matter of that dallben straightened and turned in his hands he held a sword tarans heart leaped he grasped the weapon eagerly his hands trembling so that he nearly dropped it scabbard and hilt bore no ornament the craftsmanship lay in its proportion and balance though of great age its metal shone clear and untarnished and its very plainness had the beauty of true nobility taran bowed low before dallben and stammered thanks dallben shook his head whether you should thank me or not he said remains to be seen use it wisely he added i only hope you will have cause to use it not at all what are its powers taran asked his eyes sparkling tell me now so that its powers dallben answered with a sad smile my dear boy this is a bit of metal hammered into a rather unattractive shape it could better have been a pruning hook or a plow iron its powers like all weapons only those held by him who wields it what yours may be i can in no wise say we shall make our farewells now dallben said putting a hand on tarans shoulder taran saw for the first time how ancient was the enchanters face and how careworn i prefer to see none of you before you leave dallben went on such partings are one thing i would spare myself besides later your head will be filled with other concerns and you will forget anything i might tell you be off and see if you can persuade the princess eilonwy to gird you with that sword now that you have it he sighed i suppose you might just as well observe the formalities eilonwy was putting away earthen bowls and dishes when taran hurried into the scullery look he cried dallben gave me this gird it on me i mean if you please say you will i want you to be the one to do it eilonwy turned to him in surprise yes of course she said blushing if you really i do cried taran after all he added youre the only girl in caer dallben so thats it eilonwy retorted i knew there was something wrong when you started being so polite very well taran of caer dallben if thats your only reason you can go find someone else and i dont care how long it takes you but the longer the better she tossed her head and began furiously drying a bowl now whats wrong asked taran puzzled i said please didnt i do gird it on me he urged i promise to tell you what happened at the council i dont want to know answered eilonwy i couldnt be less interested what happened oh here give me that thing deftly she buckled the leather belt around tarans waist dont think im going through all the ceremonies and speeches about being brave and invincible said eilonwy to begin with i dont think they apply to assistant pigkeepers and besides i dont know them there she said stepping back i must admit she added it does look rather well on you taran drew the blade and held it aloft yes he cried this is a weapon for a man and a warrior enough of that cried eilonwy stamping her foot impatiently what about the council were setting out for annuvin taran whispered excitedly at dawn to wrest the cauldron from arawn himself the cauldron he uses to why didnt you say so right away eilonwy cried i wont have half enough time to get my things ready how long will we be gone i must ask dallben for a sword too do you think ill need no no taran interrupted you dont understand this is a task for warriors we cant be burdened with a girl when i said we i meant what shrieked eilonwy and all this while you let me think that taran of caer dallben you make me angrier than anyone ive ever met warrior indeed i dont care if you have a hundred swords underneath it all youre an assistant pigkeeper and if gwydions willing to take you theres no reason he shouldnt take me oh get out of my scullery with a cry eilonwy seized a dish taran hunched his shoulders and fled while earthenware shattered behind him chapter adaon at first light the warriors made ready to depart taran hurriedly saddled the gray silvermaned melynlas colt of gwydions own steed melyngar gurgi miserable as a wet owl at being left behind helped load the saddlebags dallben had changed his mind about not seeing anyone and stood silent and thoughtful in the cottage doorway with eilonwy beside him im not speaking to you she cried to taran the way you acted thats like asking someone to a feast then making them wash the dishes but farewell anyway that she added doesnt count as speaking gwydion leading the horsemen moved through the swirling mist taran rose in his saddle turned and waved proudly the white cottage and the three figures grew smaller field and orchard fell away as melynlas cantered into the trees the forest closed behind taran and he could see caer dallben no more with a whinny of alarm melynlas suddenly reared as ellidyr had ridden up behind taran his steed had reached out her long neck and given the stallion a spiteful nip taran clutched at the reins and nearly fell keep your distance from islimach said ellidyr with a raw laugh she bites we are much alike islimach and i taran was about to reply angrily when adaon who had seen what happened drew his bay mare to ellidyrs side you are right son of penllarcau adaon said your horse carries a difficult burden and so do you what burden do i carry cried ellidyr bristling last night i dreamed of us all adaon said thoughtfully fingering the iron clasp at his throat you i saw with a black beast on your shoulders beware ellidyr lest it swallow you up he added the gentleness of his tone softening the harshness of his council spare me from pigboys and dreamers ellidyr retorted and with a shout urged islimach farther up the column and i taran asked what did your dream tell of me you answered adaon after a moments hesitation you were filled with grief what cause have i to grieve asked taran surprised i am proud to serve lord gwydion and there is a chance to win much honor more than by washing pigs and weeding gardens i have marched in many a battle host adaon answered quietly but i have also planted seeds and reaped the harvest with my own hands and i have learned there is greater honor in a field well plowed than in a field steeped in blood the column had begun to move more rapidly and they quickened their steeds gaits adaon rode easily and skillfully head high an open smile on his face he seemed to be drinking in the sights and sounds of the morning while fflewddur doli and coll kept pace with gwydion and ellidyr followed sullenly behind king morgants troop taran kept to adaons side along the leafstrewn path as they spoke together to ease the rigors of their journey taran soon realized there was little adaon had not seen or done he had sailed far beyond the isle of mona even to the northern sea he had worked at the potters wheel cast nets with the fisherfolk woven cloth at the looms of the cottagers and like taran labored over the glowing forge of forest lore he had studied deeply and taran listened in wonder as adaon told the ways and natures of woodland creatures of bold badgers and cautious dormice and geese winging under the moon there is much to be known said adaon and above all much to be loved be it the turn of the seasons or the shape of a river pebble indeed the more we find to love the more we add to the measure of our hearts adaons face was bright in the early rays of the sun but a trace of longing had come into his voice when taran asked him what was amiss he did not answer immediately as though he wished to hold his own thoughts my heart will be lighter when our task is done adaon said at last arianllyn my betrothed waits for me in the northern domains and the sooner arawns cauldron is destroyed the sooner may i return to her by days end they had become fast friends at nightfall when taran rejoined gwydion and his companions adaon camped with them they had already crossed great avren and were well on their way to the borders of king smoits realm gwydion was satisfied with their progress though he warned them the most difficult and dangerous portion of their journey was to come all were in good spirits save doli who hated riding horseback and gruffly declared he could go faster afoot as the companions rested in a protected grove fflewddur offered his harp to adaon and urged him to play adaon sitting comfortably with his back against a tree put the instrument to his shoulder for a moment he was thoughtful his head bowed then his hands gently touched the strings the voice of the harp and adaons voice twined one with the other in harmonies taran never before had heard the tall mans face was raised toward the stars and his gray eyes seemed to see far beyond them the forest had fallen silent the night sounds were stilled the song of adaon was not a warriors lay but one of peacefulness and deep joy and as taran listened its echoes rang again and again in his heart he longed for the music to continue but adaon stopped almost abruptly and with a grave smile handed the harp back to fflewddur the companions wrapped themselves in their cloaks and slept ellidyr remained aloof from them stretched on the ground at the hooves of his roan taran his head pillowed on his saddle his hand on his new sword was impatient for dawn and eager to resume the journey yet as he dropped into slumber he recalled adaons dream and felt a shadow like the flutter of a dark wing next day the companions crossed the river ystrad and began bearing northward with much loud grumbling at being kept from the quest king smoit obeyed gwydion and turned away from the column riding toward caer cadarn to ready his warriors later the pace of the column slowed as the pleasant meadows wrinkled into hills shortly after midday the horsemen entered the forest of idris here the brown withered grasses were sharp as thorns once familiar oaks and alders appeared strange to taran their dead leaves clung to the tangled branches and the black trunks jutted like charred bones at length the forest broke away to reveal sheer faces of jagged cliffs gwydion signaled the company forward tarans throat tightened for a cold instant he shrank from urging melynlas up the stony slope he knew without a word from gwydion that the dark gate of annuvin was not far distant narrow trails rising above deep gorges now forced the company to go in single file taran adaon and ellidyr had been jogging at the end of the column but ellidyr kicked his heels against islimachs flanks and thrust his way past taran your place is at the rear pigboy he called and your place is where you earn it cried taran giving melynlas rein to strive ahead the horses jostled the riders struggled knee against knee islimach reared and neighed wildly with his free hand ellidyr seized the bridle of melynlas to force the stallion back taran tried to turn his mounts head but melynlas in a shower of pebbles slipped from the trail to the steep slope taran flung out of the saddle clutched at the rocks to break his fall melynlas more surefooted than his master regained his balance on a ledge below the trail taran sprawled flat against the stones tried vainly to clamber back to the path adaon dismounted instantly ran to the edge of the slope and attempted to grasp tarans hands ellidyr too dismounted he brushed adaon aside leaped down and seized taran under the arms with a powerful heave he lofted taran like a sack of meal to the safety of the trail picking his way toward melynlas ellidyr put his shoulder beneath the saddle girth and strained mightily with all his strength little by little he raised melynlas until the stallion was able to clamber from the ledge you fool taran threw back at ellidyr racing to melynlas and anxiously examining the steed has your pride crowded all the wits out of your head melynlas he saw with relief was unharmed despite himself he glanced at ellidyr in amazement and not without a certain admiration i have never seen such a feat of strength taran admitted ellidyr for the first time seemed confused and frightened i did not mean for you to fall he began then he threw back his head and with a mocking smile added my concern is for your steed not your skin i too admire your strength ellidyr adaon said sharply but it is to your shame you proved it thus the black beast rides in the saddle with you i see it even now one of morgants warriors hearing the clamor had given the alarm a moment later gwydion followed by king morgant strode back along the trail behind them hurried the agitated fflewddur and the dwarf your pigboy had no better sense than to force his way ahead of me ellidyr said to gwydion had i not pulled him and his steed back is this true gwydion asked glancing at taran and his torn clothing taran about to answer shut his lips tightly and nodded his head he saw the look of surprise on ellidyrs angry face we have no lives to waste gwydion said yet you have risked two i can not spare a man or i would send you back to caer dallben this instant but i shall if this happens again and you too ellidyr or any of this company king morgant stepped forward this proves what i had feared lord gwydion our way is difficult even unburdened with the cauldron once we gain it i urge you again not to return to caer dallben it would be wiser to take the cauldron north into my realm i think too morgant continued that a number of my own warriors should be dispatched to guard our retreat in exchange i offer these three he said gesturing toward taran adaon and ellidyr a place among my horsemen when i attack if i read their faces well they would prefer it to waiting in reserve yes cried taran gripping his sword let us join the attack gwydion shook his head the plan shall be as i set it mount quickly we have already lost much time king morgants eyes flickered it shall be as you command lord gwydion what happened whispered fflewddur to taran dont tell me ellidyr wasnt to blame somehow hes a troublemaker i can see it i cant imagine what gwydion was thinking of when he brought him along the blame is as much mine said taran i behaved no better than he did i should have held my tongue with ellidyr he added thats not easy to do yes the bard sighed glancing at his harp i have a rather similar difficulty throuhgout the day the company went with greatest caution for flights of gwythaints arawns fearsome messenger birds were now seen against the clouds shortly before dusk the trail led downward toward a shallow basin set with scrub and pines there gwydion halted ahead rose the baleful crags of dark gate its twin slopes blazing crimson in the dying sun thus far the company had encountered no cauldronborn taran deemed this lucky but gwydion frowned uneasily i fear the cauldronborn more when they can not be seen gwydion said after calling the warriors around him i would almost believe they had deserted annuvin but doli brings news i wish i might spare you had me turn invisible and run ahead thats what he did doli furiously muttered to taran when we go into annuvin ill have to do it again humph my ears already feel like a swarm of bees take heed all of you gwydion went on the huntsmen of annuvin are abroad i have faced the cauldronborn taran boldly cried these warriors can be no more terrible do you believe so gwydion replied with a grim smile i dread them as much they are ruthless as the cauldronborn their strength even greater they go afoot yet they are swift with much endurance fatigue hunger and thirst mean little to them the cauldronborn are deathless taran said if these are mortal men they can be slain they are mortal gwydion answered though i scorn to call them men they are the basest of warriors who have betrayed their comrades murderers who have killed for the joy of it to indulge their own cruelty they have willingly chosen arawns realm and have sworn allegiance to him with a blood oath even they can not break yes gwydion added they can be slain but arawn has forged them into a brotherhood of killers and given them a terrible power they rove in small bands and within those companies the death of one man only adds to the strength of all the rest shun them gwydion warned do not give battle if it is possible to avoid it for the more you strike down the more the others gain in strength even as their number dwindles their power grows conceal yourselves now he ordered and sleep out our attack must be tonight restless taran could barely force himself to close his eyes when he did it was in light uneasy slumber he woke with a start groping for his sword adaon already awake cautioned him to silence the moon rode high cold and glittering the warriors of king morgants train moved like shadows there was a faint jingle of harness the whisper of a blade drawn from its sheath doli having turned himself invisible had departed toward dark gate taran found the bard strapping his beloved harp more securely to his shoulders i doubt ill really need it fflewddur admitted on the other hand you never know what youll be called on to do a fflam is always prepared beside him coll had just donned a closefitting conical helmet the sight of the stouthearted old warrior and the cap hardly seeming enough to protect his bald head filled taran suddenly with sadness he threw his arms around coll and wished him good fortune well my boy said coll winking never fear well be back before you know it then off to caer dallben and the task is done king morgant cloaked heavily in black halted at tarans side it would have done me honor to count you among my men he said gwydion has told me a little of you and i have seen you for myself i am a warrior and recognize good mettle this was the first time morgant had ever spoken directly to him and taran was so taken aback with surprise and pleasure that he could not even stammer out an answer before the war leader strode away to his horse taran caught sight of gwydion astride melyngar and ran to him let me go with you he pleaded again if i was man enough to sit with you in council and to come this far i am man enough to ride with your warriors do you love danger so much asked gwydion before you are a man he added gently you will learn to hate it yes and fear it too even as i do he reached down and clasped tarans hand keep a bold heart your courage will be tested enough disappointed taran turned away the riders vanished beyond the trees and the grove seemed empty and desolate melynlas tethered among the other steeds whinnied plaintively this night will be long adaon said looking intently past the shadows at the brooding heights of dark gate you taran shall stand first watch ellidyr second until the moon is down so you shall have more time for dreaming ellidyr said with a scornful laugh you will find no quarrel with my dreams tonight replied adaon goodnaturedly for i will share the watch with both of you sleep ellidyr he added or if you will not sleep at least keep silent ellidyr angrily wrapped himself in his cloak and threw himself on the ground near islimach the roan whickered and bent her neck nuzzling her master the night was chill frost had begun to sparkle on the dry sedge and a cloud trailed across the moon adaon drew his sword and stepped to the edge of the trees the white light caught his eyes turning them brilliant as starshine he was silent head raised alert as a wild creature of the forest do you think theyve gone into annuvin yet taran whispered they should soon be there adaon answered i wish gwydion had let me go with him taran said with a certain bitterness or with morgant do not wish that adaon said quickly his face held a look of concern why not asked taran puzzled i would have been proud to follow morgant next to gwydion he is the greatest war lord in prydain he is a brave and powerful man adaon agreed but i am uneasy for him in my dream the night before we left warriors rode a slow circle around him and morgants sword was broken and weeping blood perhaps there is no meaning in it taran suggested as much to reassure himself as adaon does it always happen that your dreams are always true adaon smiled there is truth in all things if you understand them well you never told me what you dreamed of the others taran said of coll or good old doli or yourself for the matter of that adaon did not reply but turned again and looked toward dark gate unsheathing his sword taran moved worriedly to the edge of the grove chapter in the shadow of dark gate the night passed heavily and it was nearly time for ellidyrs turn at guard when taran heard a rustling in the shrub he raised his head abruptly the sound stopped he was unsure now that he had really heard it he held his breath and waited poised and tense adaon whose ears were as keen as his eyes had also noticed it and was at tarans side in an instant there was it seemed to taran a flicker of light a branch cracked nearby with a shout taran swung up his blade and leaped toward it a golden beam flashed in his eyes and a squeal of indignation struck his ears put down that sword eilonwy cried every time i see you youre waving it around or pointing it at somebody taran fell back dumbfounded as he did a dark figure bounded past ellidyr who sprang to his feet his blade unsheathed and whistling through the air help help howled gurgi angry lord will harm gurgis poor tender head with slashings and gashings he scuttled halfway up a pine tree and from the safety of his perch shook a fist at the astonished ellidyr taran pulled eilonwy into the protection of the grove her hair was disheveled her robe torn and mudstained what have you done he cried do you want us all killed put out that light he seized the glowing sphere and fumbled vainly with it oh youll never learn how to use my bauble eilonwy said with impatience she took back the golden ball cupped it in her hand and the light vanished adaon recognizing the girl put his hand anxiously on her shoulder princess princess you should not have followed us of course she shouldnt taran put in angrily she must return immediately shes a foolish scatterbrained she is uncalled and unwanted here said ellidyr striding up he turned to adaon for once the pigboy shows sense send the little fool back to her pots taran spun around hold your tongue i have swallowed your insults to me for the sake of our quest but you will not speak ill of another ellidyrs sword leaped up taran raised his own adaon stepped between them and held out his hands enough enough he ordered are you so eager to shed blood must i hear reproof from a pigboy retorted ellidyr must i let a scullery maid cost me my head scullery maid shrieked eilonwy well i can tell you gurgi meantime had clambered cautiously from the tree and had loped over to stand behind taran and this ellidyr laughed bitterly gesturing at gurgi this thing is this the black beast that so alarmed you dreamer no ellidyr it is not murmured adaon almost sadly this is gurgi the warrior gurgi boldly cried over tarans shoulder yes yes clever valiant gurgi who joins master to keep him from harmful hurtings be silent taran ordered youve caused trouble enough how did you reach us adaon asked you are on foot well not really eilonwy said at least not all the way the horses didnt run off until a little while ago what cried taran you took horses from caer dallben and lost them you know perfectly well theyre our own horses declared eilonwy the ones gwydion gave us last year and we didnt lose them it was more as if they lost us we only stopped to let them drink and the silly things galloped away frightened i suppose i think they didnt like being so close to annuvin though ill tell you truthfully it doesnt bother me in the least in any case she concluded you neednt worry about them the last we saw they were heading straight for caer dallben and so shall you be taran said and so shall i not cried eilonwy i thought about it a long time after you left every bit as long as it took you to cross the fields and i decided it doesnt matter what anybody says fair is fair if you can be allowed on a quest so can i and there it is as simple as that and it was clever gurgi who found the way gurgi put in proudly yes yes with whiffings and sniffings gurgi does not let gentle princess go alone oh no and loyal gurgi does not leave friends behind he added reproachfully to taran since you have come this far adaon said you may await gwydion although how he will deal with you two runaways may not be to your liking your journey he added smiling at the bedraggled princess seems to have been more difficult than ours rest now and take refreshment yes yes gurgi cried crunchings and munchings for brave hungry gurgi thats very kind and thoughtful of you said eilonwy with an admiring glance at adaon much more than you can expect from certain assistant pigkeepers adaon went to the stock of provisions while ellidyr strode off to his guard post taran sat down wearily on a boulder his sword across his knees its not that were starving eilonwy said gurgi did remember to bring along the wallet of food yes and that was a gift from gwydion too so he had every right to take it its certainly a magical wallet she went on it never seems to get empty the food is really quite nourishing im sure and wonderful to have when you need it but the truth of the matter is its rather tasteless thats often the trouble with magical things theyre never quite what youd expect youre angry arent you eilonwy went on i can always tell you look as if youve swallowed a wasp if youd stopped to think of the danger taran replied instead of rushing off without knowing what youre doing youre a fine one to talk taran of caer dallben said eilonwy besides i dont think youre as angry as all that not after what you said to ellidyr it was wonderful the way you were ready to smite him because of me not that you needed to i could have taken good care of him myself and i didnt mean you werent kind and thoughtful you really are it just doesnt always occur to you for an assistant pigkeeper you do amazingly well before eilonwy could finish ellidyr gave a shout of warning a horse and rider plunged into the grove it was fflewddur behind him galloped dolis shaggy pony breathless and with his yellow hair pointing in all directions the bard flung himself from the steed and ran to adaon make ready to leave he cried take the weapons get the pack horses moving were going to caer cadarn he caught sight of eilonwy great belin what are you doing here im tired of being asked that eilonwy said the cauldron cried taran did you seize it where are the others where is doli here where else snapped a voice in another instant doli flickered into sight astride what had seemed to be an empty saddle he jumped heavily to the ground didnt even take time to make myself visible again he clapped his hands to his head oh my ears gwydion orders us to fall back immediately the bard went on in great excitement he and coll are with morgant theyll catch us up if they can if not we all rally at caer cadarn while ellidyr and adaon hurriedly untethered the animals taran and the bard packed the store of weapons keep these fflewddur ordered pressing a bow and quiver of arrows into eilonwys hands and the rest of you arm yourselves well what happened taran asked fearfully did the plan fail the plan fflewddur asked that was perfect couldnt have been better morgant and his men rode with us to dark gate ah that morgant what a warrior not a nerve in him cool as you please you might have thought he was going to a feast the bard shook his spiky head and there we were on the very threshold of annuvin oh youll hear songs about that mark my words stop yammering ordered doli hastening up with the agitated pack horses yes the plan was fine he cried angrily it would have gone slick as butter there was only one thing wrong we wasted our time and risked our necks for nothing will one or the other of you make sense eilonwy burst out i dont care about songs or butter tell us straight out where is the cauldron i dont know said the bard nobody knows you didnt lose it eilonwy gasped clapping a hand to her mouth no oh you pack of ninnies great heroes i knew i should have gone with you from the beginning doli looked as if he were about to explode his ears trembled he raised himself on tiptoe his fists clenched dont you understand the cauldron is gone away not there thats not possible taran cried dont tell me it isnt possible doli snapped i was there i know what i saw i know what i heard i went in first just as gwydion ordered i found the hall of warriors no trouble at all no guards in fact aha think i this will be easier than whistling i slipped in i could have done it in full view in broad daylight and why because theres nothing to guard the platform was empty arawn has moved the cauldron taran interrupted there is a new hiding place hes locked it up somewhere else dont you think i have the wits i was born with doli retorted that was the first thing that came into my head so i set off again id have searched arawns own chamber if id had to but i hadnt gone six paces before i ran into a pair of arawns guards or they ran into me the clumsy oafs doli muttered rubbing a bruised eye i went along with them a little way by then id heard enough it must have happened a few days ago how or who i dont know neither does arawn you can imagine his rage but whoever they were they got there ahead of us they did their work well the cauldron is gone from annuvin but thats wonderful said eilonwy our task is done and it cost us nothing more than a journey our task is far from done said the grave voice of adaon he had finished loading one of the pack horses and had come to stand beside taran ellidyr too had been listening closely weve lost the glory of fighting for it taran said but the important thing is that arawn has it no longer it is not so easy adaon warned this is a stinging defeat for arawn he will do all in his power to regain the cauldron but there is more the cauldron is dangerous in itself even out of arawns grasp what if it has fallen into other evil hands exactly what gwydion himself said fflewddur put in the thing has somehow got to be found and destroyed without delay gwydion will plan a new search from caer cadarn it would seem our work has just begun mount your steeds adaon ordered we can not overburden our pack animals the princess eilonwy and gurgi will share our own horses islimach will bear only me ellidyr said she has been trained so from a foal i would expect that being a steed of yours taran said eilonwy will ride with me and i shall take gurgi with me on lluagor adaon said come now quickly taran ran to melynlas leaped astride and pulled eilonwy up after him doli and the others hastened to mount but as they did savage cries burst from either side of them and there was a sudden hiss of arrows chapter the huntsmen of annuvin the pack horses shrieked in terror melynlas reared as arrows rattled among the branches fflewddur sword in hand spun his mount and plunged against the attackers adaons voice rang above the din these are huntsmen fight free of them at first it seemed to taran the shadows had sprung to life formless they drove against him seeking to tear him from his saddle he swung his sword blindly melynlas pitched furiously trying to break away from the press of warriors the sky had begun to unravel in scarlet threads the sun rising against black pines and leafless trees filled the grove with a baleful light taran now saw the attackers numbered about a dozen they wore jackets and leggings of animal skins long knives were thrust into their belts and from the neck of one warrior hung a curved hunting horn as the men swirled around him taran caught his breath in horror each huntsman bore a crimson brand on his forehead the sight of it filled taran with dread for he knew the strange symbol must be a mark of arawns power he fought against the fear that chilled his heart and drained his strength behind him he heard eilonwy cry out then he was seized by the belt and dragged from melynlas a huntsman tumbled with him to the ground closely grappled taran could not bring his sword into play the huntsman raised himself abruptly and thrust a knee against tarans chest the warriors eyes glinted he bared his teeth in a horrible grin as he raised a dagger the huntsmans voice froze in the midst of a shout of triumph and he suddenly fell backward ellidyr seeing tarans plight had brought down his sword in one powerful blow thrusting the lifeless body aside he heaved taran to his feet for an instant their eyes met ellidyrs face below a bloodstained mat of tawny hair held a look of scorn and pride he seemed about to speak but turned quickly without a word and ran toward the fray in the grove there was a sudden moment of silence then a long sigh rippled among the attackers as though each man had drawn breath tarans heart sank as he remembered gwydions warning with a roar the huntsmen renewed their attack with even greater ferocity dashing themselves against the struggling companions in a surge of fury from astride melynlas eilonwy fitted an arrow to her bow taran hurried to her side do not slay them he cried defend yourself but do not slay them just then a hairy twiggy figure burst from the scrub gurgi had snatched up a sword nearly as tall as himself his eyes shut tightly he stamped his feet shouted and swung the weapon about him like a scythe furious as a hornet he raced back and forth among the huntsmen bobbing up and down his blade never still as the warriors sprang aside taran saw one of them clutch the air and spin head over heels another huntsman doubled up and fell pounded by invisible fists he rolled across the ground in an attempt to escape the buffeting but no sooner did he climb to his feet than a shouting thrashing warrior was flung against him the huntsmen lashed out with their weapons only to have them ripped from their hands and tossed into the scrub against this charge they fell back in alarm doli taran cried its doli adaon took this moment to plunge forward he seized gurgi and hoisted him to lluagors back follow me adaon shouted he turned his mount and shot past the struggling warriors taran leaped to the back of melynlas with eilonwy clinging to his belt he bent low over the horses silver mane arrows flew past him as melynlas streaked ahead then the stallion was clear of the grove and pounding across open ground ears back melynlas galloped past a line of trees dry leaves flew in a whirlwind beneath churning hooves as the stallion sped to the brown crest of a hill for a moment taran dared to glance behind him below a number of huntsmen had separated from the band and with great strides held to the track of the fleeing companions they were swift even as gwydion had warned in their jackets of bristling skins they seemed wild beasts rather than men as they spread in a wide arc across the slope as they ran they called out to one another in a weird wordless cry that echoed almost from the brooding crags of dark gate itself cold with dread taran urged melynlas on clumps of grass rose high among fallen tree trunks and withered branches ahead lluagor galloped down an embankment adaon had brought them to a river bed dark water lay in a few shallow pools but for the most part it was dry and the clay banks rose high enough to offer concealment adaon reined in lluagor and cast a quick glance behind him to make sure all had followed then beckoned the companions to move forward they set off at a rapid gait the river bed wound its way through highstanding firs and tattered alders but after a little time the embankment fell away and a sparse forest became their only cover although melynlas did not slacken speed taran saw the pace had begun to tell on the other horses taran himself longed to rest dolis shaggy pony labored through the trees the bard had ridden his own mount into a lather ellidyrs face was deathly pale and he was bleeding heavily from his forehead they had not as far as taran could tell stopped hastening westward and dark gate lay some distance behind them though its peaks no longer could be seen taran had hoped adaon could have fallen back toward the path they had used earlier with gwydion but he knew now they were far from it and traveling still farther adaon led them to a dense thicket and signaled them to dismount we dare not stay here long he warned there are few hiding places arawns hunters will not discover then stand and face them cried the bard a fflam never shrinks yes yes gurgi will face them too put in gurgi although he seemed barely able to lift his head we shall stand against them only if we must adaon said they are stronger now than before and will not tire as quickly as we will we should make our stand now ellidyr cried is this the honor we gain from following gwydion to let ourselves be tracked down like animals or do you fear them too much i do not fear them taran retorted but it is no dishonor to shun them this is what gwydion himself would order eilonwy though exhausted and disheveled had not lost the use of her tongue oh be quiet both of you she commanded you worry so much about honor when youd be better off thinking of away to get back to caer cadarn taran who had been crouched against a tree raised his head from his hands from a distance came a long wavering cry another voice answered it then another are they giving up the hunt he asked have we outrun them adaon shook his head i doubt it they would not pursue us this far only to let us escape he swung stiffly to lluagors back we must ride until we find a safer place to rest we would have little hope if we let them come upon us now as ellidyr strode to the weary islimach taran took him by the arm you fought well son of penllarcau he said quietly i think that i owe you my life ellidyr turned to him with the same glance of contempt taran had seen in the grove it is a small debt he replied you value it more than i do they set out once again moving deeper into the forest as rapidly as their strength allowed the day had turned heavy with dampness and chill the sun was feeble wrapped in ragged gray clouds their progress slowed in the tangle of underbrush and the wet leaves mired the struggling animals doli who had been bent over his saddle straightened abruptly he looked sharply around him whatever he saw caused him to be strangely elated there are fair folk here he declared as taran rode up beside him are you sure taran asked how do you know though he looked closely he could see no difference between this stretch of forest and the one they had just passed through how do i know how do i know snapped doli how do you know how to swallow your dinner he kicked his heels against the ponys flanks and hurried past adaon who halted in surprise doli jumped down and after examining several trees ran quickly to the ruins of an enormous hollow oak he thrust his head inside and began shouting at the top of his voice taran too dismounted with eilonwy at his heels he ran to the tree fearful the fatigue and strain of the day had at last driven the dwarf out of his wits ridiculous muttered doli pulling his head out of the tree i cant be that far wrong he bent sighted along the ground and made incomprehensible calculations on his fingers it must be he cried king eiddileg wouldnt let things run down this badly with that he gave a number of furious kicks against the tree roots taran was sure the angry dwarf would have climbed into the tree itself had the opening in the trunk been larger ill report it doli cried yes to eiddileg himself unheard of impossible i dont know what youre doing eilonwy said brushing past the dwarf and stepping up to the oak but if youd tell us we might be able to help you as the dwarf had done she peered into the hollow trunk i dont know whos down there she called but were up here and doli wants to talk to you at least you can answer do you hear me eilonwy turned away and shook her head theyre impolite whoever they are thats worse than somebody shutting their eyes so you cant see them a faint but distinct voice rose from the tree go away it said chapter gwystyl doli hurriedly pushed eilonwy aside and ducked his head back into the tree trunk he began shouting again but the dead wood so muffled the sound that taran could distinguish nothing of the conversation which consisted mainly of long outbursts from the dwarf followed by brief and reluctant answers at length doli straightened up and beckoned the others to follow he set off at a great rate directly across the woodland and after little more than a hundred paces he jumped down a jutting bank taran leading the dwarfs pony as well as melynlas hastened to join him adaon ellidyr and the bard turned their mounts rapidly and were soon behind them the bank was so steeply inclined and overgrown that the horses could barely keep their footing they stepped delicately among the brambles and exposed rocks islimach tossed her mane and whinnied nervously the bards mount came near to falling onto her haunches and even melynlas snorted a protest against the difficult slope by the time taran reached a shelf of level ground doli had run to the protected face of the embankment and was fuming impatiently before a huge tangle of thorn bushes to tarans amazement the brambles began to shudder as though being pushed from inside then with much scraping and snapping of twigs the whole mass opened a crack its a way post of the fair folk eilonwy cried i knew they had them every which where but leave it to good old doli to find one as taran reached the dwarfs side the portal opened wide enough for him to glimpse a figure behind it doli peered inside so its you gwystyl he said i might have known so its you doli a sad voice replied i wish youd given me a little warning warning cried the dwarf ill give you more than a warning if you dont open up eiddileg will hear of this what goods a way post if you cant get into it when you have to you know the rules if any of the fair folk are in danger well thats what were in right now on top of everything else i could have shouted myself hoarse he gave a furious kick at the brambles the figure heaved a long and melancholy sigh and the portal opened wider taran saw a creature which at first glance looked like a bundle of sticks with cobwebs floating at the top he realized quickly the strange doorkeeper resembled certain of the fair folk he had once seen in eiddilegs kingdom only this individual seemed in a woeful state of disrepair unlike doli gwystyl was not of the dwarf kindred though taller he was extremely thin his sparse hair was long and stringy his nose drooped wearily above his upper lip which in turn drooped toward his chin in a most mournful expression wrinkles puckered his forehead his eyes blinked anxiously and he seemed on the verge of bursting into tears around his bent shoulders was draped a shabby grimy robe which he fingered nervously he sniffed several times sighed again and grudgingly beckoned doli to enter gurgi and fflewddur had come up behind taran gwystyl noticing them for the first time gave a stifled moan oh no he said not humans another day perhaps im sorry doli believe me but not the humans theyre with me snapped the dwarf they claim fair folk protection and ill see they get it fflewddurs horse slipping among the branches whinnied loudly and at this gwystyl clapped a hand to his forehead horses he sobbed thats out of the question bring in your humans if you must but not horses not horses today doli im simply not up to horses today please doli he moaned dont do this to me im not well not at all well really i couldnt think of it all the snorting and stamping and big bony heads besides theres no room no room at all what place is this ellidyr questioned angrily where have you led us dwarf my horse does not leave my side climb into this rathole the rest of you i shall guard islimach myself we cant leave the horses above ground doli told gwystyl who had already begun to retreat into the passageway find room or make room he ordered thats flat sniffing groaning shaking his head gwystyl with great reluctance heaved the doorway open to its full width very well he sighed bring them in bring them all in and if you know any others invite them too it doesnt matter i only suggested an appeal to your generous heart doli but i dont care now it makes no difference taran had begun to think gwystyl had good reason for concern the portal was barely high enough for the animals to pass through only with difficulty did adaons tall steed enter and islimach rolled her eyes frantically as the thorns tore at her flanks once past this barrier however taran saw they had entered a kind of gallery long and lowceilinged one side of it was solid earth the other a dense screen of thorns and branches impossible to see through but with enough cracks and crevices to admit a little air you can put the horses in there i suppose sighed gwystyl fluttering his hands in the direction of the gallery i cleaned it not long ago i wasnt expecting to have it turned into a stable but go ahead it doesnt make any difference choking and sighing to himself gwystyl then led the companions through a dampsmelling passageway on one side taran noticed an alcove had been hollowed out it was filled with roots lichens and mushrooms the food stock he guessed of the melancholy inhabitant water dripped from the dirt roof or ran in rivulets down the wall an odor of loam and dead leaves hung in the corridor farther on the passage opened into a round chamber here a small fire of sod flickered on a tiny ashladen hearth and gave out frequent puffs of sharp nosetingling smoke a disorderly pallet of straw lay nearby there was a broken table two stools and a vast number of bunches of herbs hung against the wall drying some attempt had been made to smooth the sides of the wall itself but here and there the twisting fingers of roots poked through though the chamber was intensely hot and stuffy gwystyl shuddered and pulled his robe closer about his shoulders very cozy fflewddur remarked coughing violently gurgi hurried to the fireplace and despite the smoke flung himself down beside it adaon who could barely stand to his full height seemingly paid no attention to the disorder but went to gwystyl and bowed courteously we thank you for your hospitality adaon said we have been hard pressed hospitality snapped doli weve seen precious little of that get along gwystyl and fetch something to eat and drink oh to be sure to be sure mumbled gwystyl if you really want to take the time when did you say you were leaving eilonwy gave a cry of delight look he has a tame crow near the fire on a tree limb fashioned into a crude perch crouched a heap of shadows which taran realized was indeed a large crow with eilonwy he hurried over to look at it the crow resembled more a humpy ball with straggling tailfeathers feathers as wispy and disordered as gwystyls cobwebby hair but its eyes were sharp and bright and they peered at taran critically with a few dry clicks the bird polished its beak on the perch and cocked its head its a lovely crow eilonwy said though ive never seen one with feathers quite like it theyre unusual but very handsome once you get used to them since the crow did not object taran gently stirred the feathers around its neck and ran a finger under the birds sharp and gleaming beak with sudden sadness he remembered the fledgling gwythaint he had befriended long ago it seemed and wondered how the bird had fared the crow meantime was enjoying an attention it evidently did not usually receive it bobbed its head blinked happily and attempted to run its beak through tarans hair whats its name eilonwy asked name answered gwystyl oh his name is kaw because of the noise he makes you see something like that he added vaguely kaw exclaimed fflewddur who had been watching with interest excellent how clever i should never have thought of giving it a name like that he nodded in pleasure and approval while taran smoothed the feathers of the delighted crow adaon set about examining ellidyrs wound from a small wallet at his belt he drew out a handful of dried herbs which he ground into a powder what said ellidyr are you a healer as well as a dreamer if it does not trouble me why should it trouble you if you do not choose to take it as a kindness adaon answered unperturbed and continuing to treat the cut take it as a precaution there is hard and dangerous travel before us i would not have you fall ill and delay us i shall not be the one to delay you ellidyr replied i would have stood my ground when the chance was offered now we have let ourselves be run to earth like foxes gwystyl had been peering anxiously over adaons shoulder do you have anything that might be useful for my condition he asked tremulously no i dont suppose you do well no matter theres nothing to be done about the dampness and the drafts no theyll last longer than i you can be sure he added in a dismal voice stop muttering about the drafts doli ordered brusquely and think of some way to get us out of here safely if youre in charge of a way post youre supposed to be ready in emergencies he turned away furious i dont know what eiddileg was thinking of when he put you here ive often wondered that gwystyl agreed with a melancholy sigh its much too close to annuvin for any decent kind of person to knock at your door i dont mean any of you he added hurriedly but its bleak nothing of interest really no doli im afraid theres nothing i can do for you except set you on your way as quickly as possible what about the huntsmen taran put in if theyre still tracking us huntsmen gwystyl turned a sickly greenishwhite and his hands trembled how on earth did you come across them im sorry to hear that if i had known before it might have been possible oh its too late for that theyll be all over the place now no really you could have shown a little more consideration you might think we wanted to have them after us cried eilonwy unable to curb her impatience thats like inviting a bee to come and sting you at the girls outburst gwystyl shriveled up in his robe and looked more dismal than ever he choked wiped his forehead with a trembling hand and let a large tear roll down his nose i didnt mean it that way my dear child believe me gwystyl sniffed i just dont see whats to be done about it if anything at all youve got yourself into a dreadful predicament how or why im sure i cant imagine gwydion had led us to attack arawn taran began gwystyl hurriedly raised a hand dont tell me he interrupted with an anxious frown whatever it is i dont want to hear about it id rather not know i dont want to be caught up in any of your mad schemes gwydion im surprised he at least didnt know better but its to be expected i suppose theres no use complaining our quest is urgent said adaon who had finished binding ellidyrs wound and had come to stand near gwystyl we ask you to do nothing to endanger yourself i would not tell you the circumstances that brought us here but without knowing them you can not realize how desperately we need your help we had come to seize the cauldron from annuvin taran said cauldron murmured gwystyl yes the cauldron shouted the furious dwarf you pale grub you lightless lightning bug the cauldron of arawns cauldronborn oh that cauldron gwystyl answered feebly forgive me doli i was thinking of something else when did you say you were going the dwarf seemed on the verge of seizing gwystyl by his robe and shaking him but adaon stepped forward and quickly explained what had occurred at dark gate its a shame gwystyl murmured with a sorrowful sigh you should never have got mixed up with the thing its too late to think about that im afraid youll just have to make the best of it i dont envy you believe me i dont its one of those unfortunate events but you dont understand taran said we arent mixed up with the cauldron it isnt in annuvin any more someone has already stolen it yes said gwystyl with a gloomy look at taran yes i know chapter kaw taran stopped short you know that he asked in surprise then why didnt you gwystyl gulped and darted nervous glances about him oh i know but only in a very general way you understand i mean i dont really know anything at all just the usual unfounded rumor you might expect to hear in a beastly place like this of no importance pay no attention to it gwystyl said doli sharply you know more about this than you let on now out with it the gloomy creature flung his hands to his head and began moaning and rocking back and forth do go away and let me alone he sobbed im not well i have so many tasks to finish i shall never be caught up you must tell us cried taran please he added lowering his voice for the wretched gwystyl had begun to shake violently his eyes turning up as though he were about to have a fit do not keep your knowledge from us if you stay silent our lives are risked for no purpose leave it alone gwystyl choked fanning himself with an edge of his robe dont bother with it forget it thats the best thing you can do go back wherever you came from dont even think about it how can we do that taran cried arawn wont rest until he has the cauldron again of course he wont rest gwystyl said he isnt resting now thats exactly why you should drop the search and go quietly youll only stir up more trouble and theres enough of that already then wed better get back to caer cadarn and join gwydion as quickly as we can eilonwy said yes yes by all means broke in gwystyl with the first trace of eagerness taran had glimpsed in this strange individual i only give you this advice for your own good im glad very glad youve seen fit to follow it now of course he added almost brightly youll want to be on your way very wise of you i unhappily have to stay here i envy you i really do but thats the way of it and theres little anyone can do a pleasure meeting you all goodbye goodbye cried eilonwy if we put our noses above ground and the huntsmen are waiting for us yes it will be goodbye indeed doli says its your duty to help us and with that you havent done a thing except sigh and moan if this is the best the fair folk can manage why id rather be up a tree with my toes tied together gwystyl clutched his head again please please dont shout im not up to shouting today not after the horses one of you can go and see if the huntsmen are still there not that it will really do any good for they might have just stepped away for a moment i wonder wholl do that muttered the dwarf good old doli of course i thought id done with making myself invisible i could give all of you a little something gwystyl went on not that it will do much good its a kind of powder ive put by in case of need i was saving it for emergencies what do you call this you clot doli growled yes well i meant ah more for personal emergencies gwystyl explained paling but it doesnt matter about me you can have it take all of it go ahead you put it on your feet or whatever you walk on i mean hooves and so forth gwystyl added it doesnt work too well hardly much sense in bothering because it wears off naturally if youre walking on it it would do that however it will hide your tracks for a while thats what we need said taran once we throw the huntsmen off our trail i think we can outrun them ill get some gwystyl said with eagerness it wont take a moment as he made to leave the chamber however doli took him by the arm gwystyl said the dwarf severely you have a skulking sneaking look in your eyes you might hoodwink my friends but dont forget youre also dealing with one of the fair folk i have a feeling doli added tightening his grip youre far too anxious to see us gone im beginning to wonder if i squeezed you a little what more might come out at this gwystyl rolled up his eyes and fainted away the dwarf had to haul him upright while taran and the others fanned him at length gwystyl opened one eye sorry he gasped not myself today too bad about the cauldron one of those unfortunate things the crow who had been watching all this activity turned a beady glance on his owner and flapped his wings with such vigor that gurgi roused himself in alarm orddu kaw croaked fflewddur turned in surprise well can you imagine that he didnt say kaw at all at least it didnt seem that way to me i could have sworn he said something like ordo orwen croaked kaw orgoch there said fflewddur looking at the bird with fascination he did it again its strange agreed taran it sounded like ordorwenorgoch and look at him running back and forth on his perch do you think weve upset him he acts as if he wants to tell us something began eilonwy gwystyls face meanwhile had turned the color of ancient cheese you may not want us to know said doli roughly seizing the terrified gwystyl but he does this time gwystyl i really mean to squeeze you no no doli please dont do that wailed gwystyl dont give him another thought he does odd things ive tried to teach him better habits but it doesnt do any good a flood of gwystyls pleading and moaning followed but the dwarf paid it no heed and began to carry out his threat no squealed gwystyl no squeezing not today listen to me doli he added his eyes crossing and uncrossing frantically if i tell you will you promise to go away doli nodded and relaxed his grip all kaw meant to say gwystyl went on hurriedly is that the cauldron is in the hands of orddu orwen and orgoch thats all its a shame but theres certainly nothing to be done about it it hardly seemed worth mentioning who are orddu orwen and orgoch taran asked his excitement and impatience were getting the better of him too and he was sorely tempted to aid doli in squeezing gwystyl who are they murmured gwystyl you had better ask what are they very well cried taran what are they i dont know replied gwystyl its hard to say it doesnt matter theyve got the cauldron and you might as well let it rest there he shuddered violently dont meddle with them theres no earthly use in it whoever they are or whatever they are cried taran turning to the rest of the company i say find them and take the cauldron thats what we set out to do and we should not turn back now where do they live he asked gwystyl live asked gwystyl with a frown they dont live not exactly its all very vague i really dont know kaw flapped his wings again morva he croaked i mean gwystyl moaned as the angry doli reached for him again they stay in the marshes of morva exactly where i have no idea no idea at all thats the trouble youll never find them and if you do which you wont youll wish you never had gwystyl wrung his bony hands and his trembling features indeed held a look of deepest dread i have heard of the marshes of morva adaon said they lie to the west of here how far i do not know i do interrupted fflewddur a good days journey i should say i once came upon them during my wanderings i recall them quite clearly unpleasant stretch of country and quite terrifying not that it bothered me of course undaunted i strode through a harp string snapped abruptly with a resounding twang i went around them the bard corrected himself hurriedly dreadful smelly uglylooking fens they were but he added if thats where the cauldron is then i say with taran go there a fflam never hesitates a fflam never hesitates to open his mouth put in doli gwystyl is telling the truth for once im sure of it ive heard tales back in eiddilegs realm of those whatever you call thems and they werent pleasant nobody knows much about them or if they do they arent telling you should pay attention to doli interrupted eilonwy turning impatiently to taran i dont see how you can even think about getting the cauldron away from whoever has it and not even knowing whatever has it besides eilonwy went on gwydion ordered us to meet him at caer cadarn and if my memory hasnt got holes in it from all the nonsense ive been hearing he didnt say a word about going off in the opposite direction you dont understand taran retorted when he told us to meet him he was going to plan a new search he didnt know we would find the cauldron in the first place eilonwy said you havent found the cauldron but we know where it is cried fflewddur thats just as good and in the second place eilonwy continued ignoring the bard if youve got any news about it the only wise thing is to find gwydion and tell him what you know thats sense put in doli well have enough trouble getting to caer cadarn without splashing around in swamps on a wild goose chase you listen to her shes the only one outside of myself who has any notion of what ought to be done taran hesitated it may be he said after a pause that we would be wiser returning to gwydion king morgant and his warriors can lend us their strength he spoke these words with some effort in the back of his mind he yearned to find the cauldron to bring it in triumph to gwydion nevertheless he could not deny to himself that eilonwy and doli had proposed the surer plan it seems to me then he began but he had no sooner started to agree with doli than ellidyr thrust his way to the fireside pigboy ellidyr said you have chosen well return with your friends and let us make our parting here parting asked taran puzzled do you think i would turn my back now when the prize is nearly won ellidyr said coldly go your way pigboy and i shall go mine to the marshes of morva themselves wait for me at caer cadarn ellidyr added with a scornful smile warm your courage beside the fire i shall bring the cauldron there tarans eyes flashed with anger at ellidyrs words the thought that ellidyr should find the cauldron was more than he could bear i shall warm my courage son of penllarcau he cried in whatever fire you choose go back the rest of you if thats what you want i was a fool to listen to the thoughts of a girl eilonwy gave a furious shriek doli raised a hand in protest but taran cut him short he was calmer now that his first anger had passed this is not a game of courage he said i would be twice a fool and so should we all to be goaded by an idle taunt this much at least i have learned from gwydion but there is also this arawn seeks the cauldron even now we do not dare lose the time it would take to bring help if he finds the cauldron before we do and if he doesnt put in doli how do you know he knows where it is and if he doesnt know how long will it take him to find out a merry while ill be bound even with all his cauldronborn and huntsmen and gwythaints and what have you theres a risk either way any clodpole can see that but if you ask me theres more risk than otherwise if you go popping off into the marshes of morva and you taran of caer dallben said eilonwy youre only making excuses for some harebrained idea of your own youve been talking and talking and youve forgotten one thing youre not the one to decide anything and neither are you ellidyr adaon commands you both if im not mistaken taran flushed at eilonwys reminder forgive me adaon he said bowing his head i did not intend to disobey your orders the choice is yours adaon who had been listening silently near the fire shook his head no he said quietly this choice can not be mine i have said nothing for or against your plan the decision is greater than i dare make but why cried taran i dont understand he said quickly and with concern of all of us you know best what to do adaon turned his gray eyes toward the fire perhaps you will understand one day for now choose your path taran of caer dallben he said wherever it may lead i promise you my help taran drew back and stood silent a moment filled with distress and uneasiness it was not fear touching his heart but the wordless sorrow of dry leaves rushing desolate before the wind adaon continued to watch the dance of the flames i shall go to the marshes of morva taran said adaon nodded so it shall be no one spoke then even ellidyr made no reply he bit his lips and fingered the hilt of his sword well said doli at last i suppose i might as well go along too do what i can but its a mistake i warn you mistake cried the jubilant bard by no means i wouldnt be kept away from it and i certainly wont declared eilonwy someone has to make sure there are at least a few of us with good sense along marshes ugh if you insist on making fools of yourselves i wish youd picked a drier way and gurgi will help shouted gurgi springing to his feet yes yes with seekings and peekings gwystyl said doli with a look of resignation you might as well go and fetch that powder you were talking about while gwystyl eagerly rummaged through the alcove the dwarf drew a deep breath and flickered out of sight he was back after some length of time fully visible and looking furious his ears trembling and rimmed with blue theres five huntsmen camped over the rise he said theyve settled down for the oh my ears night if that powder is any good we can be well away before they even know weve been here the companions dusted their feet and the hooves of their steeds with a black substance gwystyl distributed from a moldering sack he seemed almost gleeful as taran untethered melynlas and led the horse from behind the screen of brambles goodbye goodbye muttered gwystyl i hate to see you waste your time not to mention your lives but thats the way of it i suppose here today gone tomorrow and whats anyone to do about it goodbye i hope we meet again but not soon goodbye with that the portal shut taran took a firmer grip on the bridle of melynlas and the companions moved silently into the forest chapter a stone in the shoe outside the way post night had already fallen the sky was clear once more but the chill had deepened adaon and fflewddur held a hurried council on which path to follow and agreed the company should ride westward until dawn conceal themselves and sleep then turn due south as before eilonwy shared melynlas with taran and gurgi clung to the back of lluagor fflewddur had offered to lead the way claiming he had never been lost and could find the marshes with his eyes shut after two harp strings had snapped he reconsidered and gave up his position to adaon doli still muttering angrily about his buzzing ears rode last as rear guard although he flatly refused to make himself invisible no matter what the circumstances ellidyr had spoken to no one since leaving the melancholy gwystyl and taran had seen the cold rage in his eyes after the companions decision to press on to the marshes of morva i think he really would have tried to bring back the cauldron by himself taran said to eilonwy and you know how much chance he would have had alone thats the kind of childish thing id have done when i was an assistant pigkeeper youre still an assistant pigkeeper answered eilonwy youre going to these silly swamps because of ellidyr and anything else you say is pure nonsense dont tell me it wouldnt have been wiser to find gwydion but no you have to decide the other way and drag the rest of us along taran did not reply eilonwys words stung him all the more because he had begun to regret his own decision now the companions had set off doubts tormented him and his heart was heavy taran could not forget the strange tone in adaons voice and sought again and again to understand why he had turned from a choice rightfully his he jogged melynlas closer to adaon and leaned from the saddle i am troubled he said in a low voice and i wonder now if we should not turn back i fear you have kept something from me and had i known what it was i would have chosen otherwise if adaon shared tarans doubts he showed no sign in the saddle he rode unbowed as though he had gained new strength and the weariness of the journey could no longer touch him on his face was a look taran had never seen before and could not fathom in it was pride yet more than that for it held as well a light that seemed almost joyous after a long pause adaon said there is a destiny laid on us to do what we must do though it is not always given to us to see it i think you see many things taran replied quietly many things which you tell no one it has long been in my mind he went on with much hesitation and now more than ever the dream you had the last night in caer dallben you saw ellidyr and king morgant to me you foretold i would grieve but what did you dream of yourself adaon smiled is that what troubles you very well i shall tell you i saw myself in a glade and though winter lay all around it was warm and sunlit birds called and flowers sprang up from bare stones your dream was beautiful said eilonwy but i cant guess its meaning taran nodded yes it is beautiful i feared it had been unhappy and for that reason you chose not to speak of it adaon said nothing more and taran fell back into his own thoughts still finding no reassurance melynlas moved ahead surefooted despite the darkness the stallion was able to avoid the loose stones and fallen branches that lay across the winding path even without tarans hands on the reins his eyes heavy with fatigue taran leaned forward and patted the stallions powerful neck follow the way my friend taran murmured surely you know it better than i do at daybreak adaon raised his hand and signaled a halt throughout the night they had ridden as it seemed to taran down a long series of descending slopes they were still in the forest of idris but here the ground had leveled a little many of the trees were yet covered with leaves the undergrowth was thicker the land less stark than the hills around dark gate doli his pony snorting white mist galloped up to report no sign of the huntsmen on their trail how long that sallow mealworms powder lasts i couldnt guess said the dwarf and i dont think itll do us that much good anyway if arawns looking for the cauldron hes going to look hard and close the huntsmen must know weve come in this general direction if enough of them keep after us sooner or later theyre bound to find us that gwystyl for all the help hes been humph and his crow too humph i wish we hadnt run into either of them ellidyr had dismounted and was anxiously studying islimachs left foreleg taran too swung down and went to ellidyrs side the horse whinnied and rolled her eyes as he approached she has gone lame taran said unless we can help her i fear she will not be able to hold the pace i need no pigboy to tell me that answered ellidyr he bent and examined the mares hoof with a gentleness of touch which surprised taran if you lightened her burden taran suggested it might ease her for a while fflewddur can take you up behind him ellidyr straightened his eyes black and bitter do not give me council on my own steed islimach can go on and so she will nevertheless as ellidyr turned away taran saw his face fill with lines of worry let me look at her taran said perhaps i can find the trouble he knelt and reached toward islimachs foreleg do not touch her cried ellidyr she will not abide a strangers hands islimach reared and bared her teeth ellidyr laughed scornfully learn for yourself pigboy he said her hooves are sharp as knives as you shall see taran rose and grasped islimachs bridle for a moment as the horse lunged he feared she would indeed trample him islimachs eyes were round with terror she whickered and struck out at him a hoof glanced against his shoulder but taran did not loosen his hold he reached up and put a hand to islimachs long bony head the mare shuddered but taran spoke quietly and soothingly to her she tossed her mane the straining muscles relaxed the reins went loose and she made no attempt to draw away without stopping the flow of reassuring words taran raised her hoof as he had suspected there was a small jagged stone wedged far back behind the shoe he drew his knife islimach trembled but taran worked quickly and deftly the stone came free and fell to the ground this has happened even to melynlas taran explained patting the roans flank theres a place deep in the hoof anyone can miss it if they dont know it was coll who showed me how to find it ellidyrs face was livid you have tried to steal honor from me pigboy he said through clenched teeth will you now rob me of my horse taran had expected no thanks but the angry thrust of ellidyrs words took him aback ellidyrs hand was on his sword taran felt a surge of answering anger a flush rising to his cheeks but he turned away your honor is your own taran answered coldly and so is your steed what stone is in your shoe prince of pen llarcau he strode to his companions who had taken cover in the tangle of brush gurgi had already opened the wallet and was proudly distributing its contents yes yes gurgi cried gleefully crunchings and munchings for all thanks to generous kindhearted gurgi he will not let brave warriors suffer bellies filled only with howlings and growlings ellidyr remained behind patting islimachs neck and murmuring in the roans ear since he made no move to join the companions at their meal taran called out to him but the prince of penllarcau only gave him a bitter glance and remained with islimach that foultempered nag is the only thing he cares about muttered the bard and as far as i can see the only thing that cares about him theyre two of a kind if you ask me adaon sitting a little apart from the others called taran to him i commend your patience he said the black beast spurs ellidyr cruelly i think hell feel better once we find the cauldron taran said there will be glory enough for all to share adaon smiled gravely is there not glory enough in living the days given to us you should know there is adventure in simply being among those we love and the things we love and beauty too but i would speak to you of another matter adaon went on his handsome face usually tranquil was clouded i have few possessions for i count them of little importance but these few i treasure lluagor my packets of healing herbs and this he said touching the clasp at his throat the brooch i wear a precious gift from arianllyn my betrothed should any ill befall me they are yours i have watched you closely taran of caer dallben in all my journeys i have met no one else to whom i would rather entrust them do not speak of ill befalling you taran cried we are companions and protect one another against dangers besides adaon your friendship is gift enough for me nevertheless adaon replied we can not know all the future holds will you accept them taran nodded it is well adaon said now my heart is lighter after the meal it was decided they would rest until midday ellidyr made no comment when adaon ordered him to stand the first watch taran rolled up in his cloak under the protection of a bush exhausted by the journey and by his own doubts and fears he slept heavily the sun was high when he opened his eyes he sat up with a start realizing his turn at guard had almost passed around him the companions still slept ellidyr he called why didnt you wake me he rose hurriedly to his feet there was no sign of ellidyr or islimach taran hastily roused the others he ran a little distance into the trees then circled back hes gone taran cried hes gone after the cauldron alone he said he would and now hes done it stolen a march on us has he grumbled doli well well catch up to him and if we dont thats his concern he doesnt know where hes going and for the matter of that neither do we good riddance to him said fflewddur if we have any kind of luck at all we may not see him again for the first time taran saw deep alarm in adaons face we must overtake him quickly adaon said ellidyrs pride and ambition swallow him up i fear to think what might happen should the cauldron come into his hands they set off with all possible haste adaon soon found ellidyrs trail leading southward i was hoping he might have got disgusted with the whole business and gone home said fflewddur but theres no doubt of it hes heading for morva despite their speed the companions saw no sign of ellidyr himself they pressed on urging the last strength from the laboring horses until they were obliged to halt for breath a cold wind had risen swirling the leaves in great circles above their heads i do not know if we can overtake him adaon said he rides as swiftly as we and he is nearly a quarter days journey ahead of us his heart pounding taran flung himself from melynlas and slumped to the ground he cradled his head in his hands from a distance came the shrill call of a bird the first birdsong he had heard since leaving caer dallben that is not the true speech of a bird adaon cried springing to his feet the huntsmen have found us without awaiting adaons order the dwarf raced in the direction of the huntsmens signal as taran watched doli vanished before his eyes adaon drew his sword this time we must stand against them he said we can run from them no longer quickly he commanded taran eilonwy and gurgi to ready their bows while he and the bard mounted their horses within moments the dwarf was back again five huntsmen he cried go on the rest of you ill play them the same trick no said adaon i do not trust it to work again hurry follow me he led them through a clearing and halted at the far side here we make our stand adaon said to taran as soon as they come in sight fflewddur doli and i will charge them from the flank when they turn to give battle loose your arrows adaon swung around to face the clearing in another instant the huntsmen burst from cover they had no sooner taken a stride forward than adaon with a great cry urged his horse across the ground doli and the bard galloped beside him even as taran drew his bow adaon was in the midst of the huntsmen striking left and right with his blade the dwarf had pulled the stubby axe from his belt and chopped furiously at his enemies surprised by the fierce attack the huntsmen spun about to engage the riders taran loosed his arrow and heard the shafts of eilonwy and gurgi whistle past him the flight of all three went wild snatched by the wind and skittering among the dry bushes shouting madly gurgi fitted another arrow to his bow three huntsmen pressed toward fflewddur and the dwarf forcing them into a thicket adaons sword flashed and rang against the weapons of his assailants now taran dared not loose another shaft for fear of hitting one of the companions we are fighting uselessly he cried and flung his bow to the ground he unsheathed his sword and ran to adaons aid one of the huntsmen shifted his attack to taran who struck out at him with all his strength his blow glanced from the jacket of animal skins but the huntsman lost his footing and dropped to earth taran stepped forward he had forgotten the vicious daggers of the huntsmen until he saw the man raise himself and snatch at his belt taran froze with horror in front of him he saw the snarling face with its crimson brand the arm uplifted to throw the blade suddenly lluagor was between him and the huntsman adaon rose in the saddle and swept down with his sword as the huntsman toppled the knife flew glittering through the air adaon gasped and dropped his weapon he slumped over lluagors mane clutching the dagger in his breast with a cry of anguish taran caught him as he was about to fall fflewddur doli taran shouted to us adaon is wounded chapter the brooch fflewddurs horse reared as the huntsmen turned their attack against him the death of one of their band had roused the enemy to even greater violence and frenzy take him to safety cried the bard with a mighty leap his steed cleared the bushes and streaked into the forest the dwarf on his pony followed with a shout of rage the remaining huntsmen pursued them taran seized lluagors bridle and while adaon clung to the horses mane raced toward the edge of the clearing eilonwy ran to meet them between them they kept adaon from falling and tore their way into the undergrowth gurgi leading melynlas hurried after them they ran blindly stumbling through brambles and harsh nets of dead vines the wind had risen cold and biting as a winter gale but the forest opened a little and as the ground dipped they found themselves in a protected hollow in a glade of alders from the back of lluagor adaon raised his head and gestured for them to stop his face was gray and drawn his black hair damp on his brow put me down he murmured leave me i can go no farther how do the bard and doli fare they have led the huntsmen away from us taran answered quickly we are safe here for a while i know doli can throw them off our trail and fflewddur will help him theyll join us again somehow im sure rest now ill fetch your medicines from the saddlebags carefully they lifted adaon from his steed and carried him to a hillock while eilonwy brought the leather water flask taran and gurgi unharnessed lluagor and set the saddle under adaons head the wind howled above the trees but this sheltered spot by contrast seemed warm the driven clouds broke away the sun turned the branches to gold adaon raised himself his gray eyes scanned the glade and he nodded briefly yes this is a fair place i shall rest here we shall heal your wound taran replied hastily opening a packet of herbs youll soon be comfortable and if we must move we can make a litter from branches and sling it between our horses i am comfortable enough adaon said the pain has gone and it is pleasant here as warm as spring at adaons words tarans heart filled with terror the quiet glade the sun on the alders seemed suddenly menacing adaon he cried in alarm this is what you dreamed it is much like it adaon answered quietly you knew then cried taran you knew there would be peril for you why did you not speak of it before i would never have sought the marshes we could have turned back adaon smiled it is true indeed that is why i dared not speak i have yearned to be again at the side of my beloved arianllyn and my thoughts are with her now but had i chosen to return i would ever wonder whether my choice was made through wisdom or following the wishes of my own heart i see this is as it must be and the destiny laid upon me i am content to die here you saved my life taran cried you will not lose your own life for me we shall find our way to caer cadarn and gwydion adaon shook his head he put his hand to his throat and undid the iron clasp at the collar of his jacket take this he said guard it well it is a small thing but more valuable than you know i must refuse answered taran with a smile that ill concealed his anxiety such would be the gift of a dying man but you shall live adaon take it adaon repeated this is not my command to you but the wish of one friend to another he pressed the brooch into tarans unwilling hand eilonwy had come with water to steep the herbs taran took it from her and knelt again beside adaon adaons eyes had closed his face was calm his hand lay outstretched and open on the ground and thus he died when their grief abated a little the companions hollowed out a grave lining it with flat stones wrapping him in his cloak they lowered adaon into the earth and laid the turf gently over him while lluagor whinnied plaintively and pawed the dry ground then they raised a mound of boulders in a sheltered corner of the glade eilonwy found handfuls of small flowers still untouched by the frost these she scattered on the grave where they fell among the crevices and seemed to spring from the rocks themselves they remained there silently until nightfall without a sign of fflewddur or doli we shall wait for them until dawn taran said beyond that we dare not stay i fear we have lost more than one gallant friend adaon warned that i would grieve he murmured to himself and so i do thrice over too burdened with sorrow too weary even to set a guard they huddled in their cloaks and slept like his spirit tarans dreams were confused filled with dismay and fear in them he saw the mournful faces of the companions the calm face of adaon he saw ellidyr seized by a black beast that sank its claws into him and gripped him until ellidyr cried out in torment the restless images gave way to a vast sweep of meadow where taran ran through grasses shoulder high desperately seeking a path he could not find overhead a gray bird fluttered and spread its wings he followed it and a path opened at his feet he saw too a turbulent stream with a great boulder in the midst of it on the boulder lay fflewddurs harp which played of itself as the wind stirred the strings taran was running then through a trackless marsh a bear and two wolves set upon him and made to rend him with their fangs terrified he sprang into a dark pool but the water suddenly turned to dry land the enraged beasts snarled and leaped after him he woke with a start his heart pounding the night had barely ended the first streaks of dawn rose above the glade eilonwy stirred gurgi whimpered in his sleep taran bowed his head and put his face in his hands the dream lay heavily upon him he could still see the gaping jaws of a wolf and the sharp white teeth he shuddered he knew he must decide now whether to return to caer cadarn or seek the marshes of morva taran looked beside him at the sleeping figures of gurgi and eilonwy in little more than a day the companions had been scattered like leaves and there remained only this pitifully small band itself lost and driven how could they hope to find the cauldron taran doubted they would even be able to save their own lives yet the journey to caer cadarn would be as perilous as this quest perhaps more so nevertheless a choice had to be made he rose after a time and saddled the horses eilonwy was now awake and gurgi was poking a tousled twigcovered head from the folds of his cloak hurry taran ordered wed better get an early start before the huntsmen overtake us theyll find us soon enough eilonwy said theyre probably as thick as burdock between here and caer cadarn we are going to the marshes taran said not caer cadarn what eilonwy cried are you still thinking about those wretched swamps do you seriously think we can find that cauldron let alone haul it back from wherever it is on the other hand eilonwy went on before taran could answer her i suppose its the only thing we can do now that youve got us in the stew and theres no telling what ellidyr has in mind if you hadnt made him jealous over a silly horse i feel pity for ellidyr taran answered adaon once told me he saw a black beast on ellidyrs shoulders now i understand a little what he meant well remarked eilonwy im surprised to hear you say that but it was kindhearted of you to help islimach im really glad you did im sure you meant well and thats encouraging in itself it does make a person think there might be some hope for you after all taran did not reply for he was still anxious and oppressed although the disturbing dreams had already begun to fade he swung astride melynlas gurgi and eilonwy shared lluagor and the companions swiftly rode from the glade it was tarans intention to head southward hoping somehow to come upon the marshes of morva within another day although he admitted to himself that he had no more than a vague idea of their distance or exact location the day was bright and crisp as melynlas cantered over the frosty ground taran caught sight of a glittering dew covered web on a hawthorn branch and of the spider busily repairing it taran was aware strangely of vast activities along the forest trail squirrels prepared their winter hoard ants labored in their earthen castles he could see them clearly not so much with his eyes but in a way he had never known before the air itself bore special scents there was a ripple sharp and clear like cold wine taran knew without stopping to think that a north wind had just begun to rise yet in the middle of this he noticed another scent mingled through he turned melynlas toward it since youre leading us eilonwy remarked i wonder if it would be too much to expect you to know where youre going there is water nearby taran said we shall need to fill our flasks he hesitated puzzled yes there is a stream he murmured im sure of it we must go there nevertheless he could not quite overcome his surprise when after a short while they indeed came upon a swift running brook winding its way through a stand of rowans they rode to its bank with a cry taran sharply reined in melynlas on a rock in the middle of the stream sat fflewddur cooling his bare feet in the water the bard leaped up and splashed across to greet the companions though haggard and worn he appeared unwounded now theres a stroke of luck my finding you your finding me rather i hate to admit it but im lost completely got turned around somehow after doli and i began leading the huntsmen a chase tried to make my way back to you and got lost even more how is adaon im glad you managed to the bard stopped tarans expression told him what had happened fflewddur shook his head sadly there are few like adaon he said we can ill afford the loss nor the loss of our good old doli im not sure what happened fflewddur went on all i know is that we were galloping at top speed you should have seen him he rode like a madman popping invisible and back again the huntsmen racing after him if it hadnt been for him theyd have dragged me down for certain theyre stronger than ever now then my horse fell that is to say the bard hastily added as his harp strings tensed and jangled i fell off fortunately by that time doli had led them well away at the rate he was going fflewddur sighed heavily what has befallen him since then i do not know the bard bound up his leggings he had walked all the distance and was quite pleased to be riding once again gurgi mounted behind him on lluagor taran and eilonwy rode melynlas the bards news lowered tarans spirits further for he realized now there was little chance of doli rejoining them nevertheless he continued to lead the companions southward until he should recognize a landmark fflewddur agreed this was the only course the trouble is he explained if we veer too far south well simply end up in the sea and miss the marshes altogether taran himself could offer no suggestions downcast he gave melynlas rein and made little effort to guide the stallion the trees thinned out behind him and the companions entered a wide rolling meadow taran halfdozing in the saddle his cloak wrapped around his shoulders roused himself uneasily the meadow with its high grass stretching all around them was familiar he had seen it before where he could not quite remember he fingered adaons clasp at his throat suddenly with fear and excitement he understood his hands trembled at the discovery taran glanced overhead a gray bird circled glided downward on outspread wings then flew rapidly across the fields and disappeared from sight that was a marsh bird taran said quickly turning melynlas if we follow this way he added pointing in the direction of the birds flight im sure well come directly to morva well done cried the bard i must say i never would have noticed it thats at least one clever thing youve done today eilonwy admitted this is not my doing taran said with a puzzled frown adaon spoke the truth his gift is a precious one he told eilonwy hurriedly about the clasp and the dreams of the night before dont you see he cried i dreamed about fflewddurs harp and we found fflewddur himself it wasnt all my own idea to go looking for a stream it just came to me and i knew we would find it just now when i saw the bird that was in my dream and there was another dream a terrible one of wolves thats going to happen too im sure of it adaons dreams were always true he told me of them at first eilonwy was loath to believe him adaon was a wonderful man she said you cant tell me it was all because of a piece of iron i dont care how magical it is i dont mean that taran said what i believe he added thoughtfully is that adaon understood these things anyway even with his clasp there is much i do not understand all i know is that i feel differently somehow i can see things i never saw before or smell or taste them i cant say exactly what it is its strange and awesome in a way and very beautiful sometimes there are things that i know taran shook his head and i dont even know how i know them eilonwy was silent for a moment yes she said slowly i believe it now you dont even sound quite like yourself adaons clasp is a priceless gift it gives you a kind of wisdom she added which i suppose is what assistant pig keepers need more than anything else chapter the marshes of morva from the moment the marsh bird appeared taran led the companions swiftly following without hesitation a path which now seemed clear he felt the powerful muscles of melynlas moving beneath him and guided the steed with unaccustomed skill the stallion responded to this new touch on the reins with mighty bursts of speed so much so that lluagor could barely keep pace fflewddur shouted for taran to halt a bit and let them all catch their breath gurgi looking like a windblown haystack gratefully clambered down and even eilonwy gave a sigh of relief since weve stopped taran said gurgi might as well share out some food but wed better find shelter first if we dont want to get soaked soaked cried fflewddur great belin there isnt a cloud in the sky its a gorgeous day taking everything into consideration if i were you eilonwy advised the puzzled bard i should listen to him usually thats not a wise thing to do but the circumstances are a little different now the bard shrugged and shook his head but followed taran across the rolling fields into a shallow ravine there they found a wide and fairly deep recess in the shoulder of a hill i hope you arent wounded remarked fflewddur my war leader at home has an old wound that gives him a twinge when the weather changes very handy i admit though it does seem a painful way of foretelling rain i always think its easier just to wait and every kind of weathers bound to come along sooner or later the wind has shifted taran said it comes from the sea now its restless with a briny taste theres a smell of grass and weeds too which makes me think we arent far from morva if all goes well we may reach the marshes by tomorrow soon afterward the sky indeed clouded over and a chill rain began pelting against the hill in moments it grew to a heavy downpour water coursed in rivulets on either side of their shelter but the companions remained dry wise master shouted gurgi protects us from slippings and drippings i must say the bard remarked you foretold it exactly not i said taran without adaons clasp im afraid wed all have been drenched hows that asked the perplexed fflewddur i shouldnt think a clasp would have anything to do with it as he had explained to eilonwy taran now told the bard what he had learned of the brooch fflewddur cautiously examined the ornament at tarans throat very interesting he said whatever else it may have it bears the bardic symbol those three lines there like a sort of arrowhead i saw them taran said but i didnt know what they were naturally said fflewddur its part of the secret lore of the bards i learned that much when i was trying to study for my examinations but what do they mean taran asked as i recall put in eilonwy the last time i asked him to read an inscription yes said fflewddur with embarrassment that was something else again but i know the bardic symbol well it is secret though since you have the clasp i dont suppose it can do any harm for me to tell you the lines mean knowledge truth and love thats very nice said eilonwy but i cant imagine why knowledge truth and love should be so much of a secret perhaps i should say unusual as much as secret answered the bard i sometimes think its hard enough to find any one of them even separately put them all together and you have something very powerful indeed taran who had been thoughtfully fingering the clasp stopped and looked about him uneasily hurry he said we must leave here at once taran of caer dallben eilonwy cried youre going too far i can understand coming out of the rain but i dont see deliberately going into it nevertheless she followed and the companions at tarans urgent command untethered the horses and ran from the hillside they had not gone ten paces before the entire slope weakened by the downpour collapsed with a loud roar gurgi yelped in terror and threw himself at tarans feet oh great brave and wise master gurgi is thankful his poor tender head is spared from terrible dashings and crashings fflewddur put his hands on his hips and gave a low whistle well well fancy that another moment and wed have been buried for good and all never part with that clasp my friend its a true treasure taran was silent his hand went to adaons brooch and he stared at the shattered hill slope with a look of wonder the rain slackened a little before nightfall although drenched and chilled to the bone the companions had made good progress by the time taran allowed them to rest again here gray and cheerless moors spread before them wind and water had worn crevices in the earth like the gougings of a giants fingers the companions made their camp in a narrow gorge glad for the chance to sleep even on the muddy ground taran drowsed with one hand on the iron brooch the other grasping his sword he was less weary than he had expected despite the grueling ride a strange sense of excitement thrilled him different from what he had felt when dallben had presented him with the sword however his dreams that night were troubled and unhappy at first light as the companions began their journey again taran spoke of his dreams to eilonwy i can make no sense of them he said with hesitation i saw ellidyr in mortal danger at the same time it was as though my hands were bound and i could not help him im afraid the only place youre going to see ellidyr is in your dreams replied eilonwy there certainly hasnt been a trace of him anywhere for all we know he could have been to morva and gone or not even reached the marshes in the first place its too bad you didnt dream of an easier way to find that cauldron and put an end to all this im cold and wet and at this point im beginning not to care who has it i dreamed of the cauldron too taran said anxiously but everything was confused and clouded it seems to me we came upon the cauldron and yet he added when we found it i wept eilonwy for once was silent and taran had no heart to speak of the dream again shortly after midday they reached the marshes of morva taran had sensed them long before as the ground had begun to turn spongy and treacherous under the hooves of melynlas he had seen more marsh birds and had heard far in the distance the weird and lonely voice of a loon ropes of fog twisting and creeping like white serpents had begun to rise from the reeking ground now the companions halted and stood in silence at a narrow neck of the swamp from there the marshes of morva stretched westward to the horizon here huge growths of thorny furze rose up at the far side taran distinguished meager clumps of wasted trees under the gray sky pools of stagnant water flickered among dead grasses and broken reeds a scent of ancient decay choked his nostrils a ceaseless thrumming and groaning trembled in the air gurgis eyes were round with terror and the bard shifted uneasily on lluagor youve led us here well enough said eilonwy but how do you ever expect to go about finding a cauldron in a place like this taran motioned her to be silent as he looked across the dreaded marshes something stirred in his mind do not move he cautioned in a low voice he glanced quickly behind him gray shapes appeared from the line of bushes straggling over a hillock they were not two wolves as he had thought at first but two huntsmen in jackets of wolf pelts another huntsman in a heavy cloak of bearskin crouched beside them the huntsmen have found us taran went on quickly follow every step i take but not a motion until i give the signal now he understood the dream of the wolves clearly and knew exactly what he must do the huntsmen believing they could take their prey unawares drew closer now shouted taran he urged melynlas forward and galloped headlong into the marshes heaving and plunging the stallion labored through the mire with a great shout the huntsmen raced after him once melynlas nearly foundered in a deep pool the great strides of the pursuers brought them closer so close that in a fearful backward glance taran saw one of them teeth bared in a snarl reach out to clutch the stirrups of lluagor taran spun melynlas to the right lluagor followed a shout of terror rose behind them one of the men clad in wolfskin had stumbled and pitched forward screaming as the black bog seized and sucked him down his two comrades grappled each other striving desperately to flee the ground that fell away under their feet the huntsman in bearskin flung out his arms and scrabbled at the weeds growling in rage the last warrior trampled the sinking man vainly seeking a foothold to escape the deadly bog melynlas galloped onward brackish water spurted at his hooves but taran guided the powerful stallion along what seemed a chain of submerged islands never stopping even when he reached the far side of the swamp there on more solid ground he raced through the furze and beyond the clump of trees while lluagor pounded after him taran followed a long gully toward the protection of a high mound suddenly he reined in the stallion at the side of the mound almost a part of the turf itself rose a low cottage it was so cleverly concealed with sod and branches that taran had to look again to see there was a doorway circling the hill were tumbledown stables and something resembling a demolished chicken roost taran began to back melynlas away from this strange cluster of buildings and cautioned the others to keep silent i shouldnt worry about that eilonwy said whoever lives in there surely heard us coming if they arent out to welcome us or fight with us by now then i dont think anyones there at all she leaped from melynlas and made her way toward the cottage come back taran called he unsheathed his sword and followed her the bard and gurgi dismounted and drew their own weapons alert and cautious taran approached the low doorway eilonwy had discovered a window halfhidden by turf and grass and was peering through it i dont see anybody she said as the others came up beside her look for yourself for the matter of that said the bard ducking his head and squinting past eilonwy i dont think anyones been here for quite some time so much the better in any case well have a dry place to rest the chamber taran saw indeed seemed deserted of inhabitants at least for the room was even more heaped up and disorderly than dallbens in one corner stood a wide loom with a good many of the threads straggling down the work on the frame was less than halffinished and so tangled and knotted he could imagine no one ever continuing it broken crockery covered a small table rusted and broken weapons were piled about how would you like it asked a cheerful voice behind taran if you were turned into a toad and stepped on chapter the cottage taran spun around and raised his sword suddenly in his hand writhed a cold serpent hissing and twisting to strike with a cry of horror he flung it away the serpent fell to the ground and there in its place lay tarans blade eilonwy stifled a scream taran drew back fearfully facing him was a short and rather plump little woman with a round lumpy face and a pair of very sharp black eyes her hair hung like a clump of discolored marsh weeds bound with vines and ornamented with bejeweled pins that seemed about to lose themselves in the hopeless tangle she wore a dark shapeless ungirt robe covered with patches and stains her feet were bare and exceptionally large the companions drew closer together gurgi trembling violently crouched behind taran the bard looking pale and uneasy nevertheless prepared to stand his ground come along my ducklings the enchantress said cheerily i promise it wont hurt a bit you can bring your sword if you want she added with an indulgent smile at taran though you wont need it ive never seen a toad with a sword on the other hand ive never seen a sword with a toad so youre welcome to do as you please we please to stay as we are cried eilonwy dont think were going to let anybody who are you taran cried we have done you no harm you have no cause to threaten us how many twigs in a birds nest asked the enchantress suddenly answer quickly there you see she added poor chicks you dont even know that how could you be expected to know what you really want out of life one thing i want retorted eilonwy is not to be a toad youre a pretty little duck said the enchantress in a kind cajoling voice would you give me your hair once youve done with it i have such trouble with mine these days do you ever have the feeling things are disappearing into it and you might never see them again no matter she went on youll enjoy being toads skipping about here and there sitting on toadstools well perhaps not that toads dont really sit on toadstools but you might dance in dew circles now theres a charming thought dont be frightened she added leaning over and whispering in tarans ear you cant for a moment imagine id do all i said goodness no i wouldnt dream of stepping on you i couldnt stand the squashiness with mounting terror taran cast desperately about in his mind for some means of saving his companions he would have considered this disheveled creatures intention as mad and impossible had he not remembered the serpent in his hand its menacing fangs and cold eyes you mightnt like being toads at first the enchantress said reasonably it takes getting used to but she added in a reassuring tone once its happened im certain you wouldnt want it any other way why are you doing this taran cried with all the more anger at feeling himself powerless he turned his head in fear and revulsion as the enchantress gave him a kindly pat on the cheek cant have people poking and prying she said you understand that much dont you make an exception for one then its two three and next thing you know hundreds and hundreds trampling things and getting underfoot believe me this is best for everybody from around the side of the hill at that moment two more figures appeared both closely resembled the stout little woman except that one wore a black cloak with the hood pulled up nearly concealing her face and at the throat of the other hung a necklace of milky white stones the enchantress ran to them and called out happily orwen orgoch hurry were going to make toads taran gasped he shot a quick glance at the bard and eilonwy did you hear those names he whispered hurriedly weve found them the bards face was filled with alarm much good it may do us he said by the time theyre through i dont think were going to care about the cauldron or anything else ive never danced in a dew circle he continued under his breath in different circumstances i might enjoy it but not now he added with a shudder ive never met a person whispered eilonwy while gurgi snuffled in fright who could talk about such dreadful things and smile at the same time its like ants walking up and down your back we must try to take them unawares taran said i dont know what they can do to all of us all at once i dont even know if theres anything we can do to them but we must take the chance one or two of us may survive i suppose thats all we can do agreed the bard he swallowed with difficulty and gave taran a worried look if it should turn out that i i mean if i should be yes well what i mean is should anything happen to me i beg you do pay attention to where you tread meantime the three enchantresses had returned to the cottage oh orddu the one with the necklace was saying why must it always be toads cant you think of anything else but theyre so neat replied orddu compact and convenient whats wrong with toads asked the hooded one thats the trouble with you orwen always trying to make things complicated i only suggested something else orgoch answered the enchantress called orwen for the sake of variety i love toads murmured orgoch smacking her lips even in the shadow of the hood taran could see the features of the enchantress moving and twitching in what he feared was impatience look at them standing there orddu said poor little goslings all wet and muddy ive been talking to them and i think they finally realize whats best for them why those are the ones we saw galloping across the marsh said orwen toying with her beads it was so clever of you she added smiling at taran to have the huntsmen swallowed up in the bog really quite well done disgusting creatures huntsmen muttered orgoch nasty hairy vicious things they turn my stomach they stick to their work ventured the bard ill say that much for them we had a whole flock of huntsmen here the other day said orddu they were poking and prying around just as you were now you understand why i said we couldnt make exceptions we didnt make exceptions of them did we orddu said orwen though it wasnt toads if you remember i remember very distinctly my dear replied the first enchantress but you were orddu then and when youre being orddu you can do as you please but im orddu today and what i say is thats not fair interrupted orgoch you always want to be orddu ive had to be orgoch three times in a row while youve only been orgoch once its not our fault my sweet said orddu if we dont like being orgoch it isnt comfortable you know you have such horrid indigestion if youd only pay more attention to what you take for your meals taran had been trying to follow this conversation of the enchantresses but found himself more confused than ever now he had no clear idea which was really orddu orwen and orgoch or whether they were all three the same however their remarks about the huntsmen gave him hope for the first time if the huntsmen of annuvin are your enemies taran said then we have common cause we too have fought against them enemies friends it all comes to the same in the end muttered orgoch do make haste orddu and take them off to the shed its been a terribly long morning you are a greedy creature said orddu with a tolerant smile at the hooded crone theres another reason why neither of us wants to be orgoch if we can possibly help it perhaps if you learned to control yourself better now listen to what these dear mice have to tell us it should be interesting they say such charming things orddu turned to taran now my duckling she said pleasantly how did it come about that youre on such bad terms with the huntsmen taran hesitated fearful of revealing gwydions plan they attacked us he began of course they did my poor goslings said orddu with sympathy theyre always attacking everybody thats one of the advantages of being toads you neednt worry about such things any more it will be all romps in the forest and lovely wet mornings the huntsmen wont vex you any more true you shall have to keep an eye out for herons kingfishers and serpents but apart from that you wont have a care in the world but who is us interrupted orwen she turned to orddu arent you going to find out their names yes by all means murmured orgoch with a lipsmacking sound i love names once again taran hesitated this this he said gesturing toward eilonwy is indeg and prince glessic orwen giggled and gave orddu an affectionate nudge listen to them she said theyre delightful when they lie if they wont give their right names said orgoch then simply take them taran stopped short orddu was studying him closely with sudden discouragement he realized his efforts were useless this is eilonwy daughter of angharad he said and fflewddur fflam a bard of the harp fflewddur added and this is gurgi taran continued so thats a gurgi said orwen with great interest it seems to me ive heard of them but i never knew what they were its not a gurgi retorted eilonwy its gurgi and theres only one yes yes gurgi put in venturing to step from behind taran and he is bold and clever he will not let brave companions become toads with humpings and jumpings orgoch looked curiously at him what do you do with the gurgi she asked do you eat it or sit on it i should think orddu suggested whatever you did you would have to clean it first and you my duck she said to taran who are you taran straightened and threw back his head i am taran he said assistant pigkeeper of caer dallben dallben cried orddu you poor lost chicken why didnt you say so in the first place tell me how is dear little dallben chapter little dallben tarans jaw dropped before he could answer the enchantresses had crowded around the companions and were leading them to the cottage in wonder he turned to fflewddur who looked less pale now that orddu had stopped speaking of toads little dallben taran whispered ive never in my life heard anyone talk about him that way can they mean the same dallben i dont know whispered the bard in return but if they think it is great belin dont tell them otherwise inside with a great deal of joyous bustling that in fact accomplished little the enchantresses hurried to straighten up the chamber orwen in obvious excitement and delight brought out a number of rickety chairs and stools orgoch cleared the table of crockery by brushing it onto the floor orddu clapped her hands and beamed at the companions i should never have thought it she began oh no no my duck she cried suddenly to eilonwy who had drawn closer to the loom and had just bent forward to examine the fabric mustnt touch nasty prickles if you do its full of nettles come sit with us theres a love despite the sudden warmth of their welcome taran glanced at the enchantresses with uneasiness the chamber itself filled him with odd forebodings he could not name which eluded him like shadows gurgi and the bard however appeared delighted at the strange turn of events and set heartily to eating the food that soon arrived at the table taran looked questioningly at eilonwy the girl guessed his thought dont be afraid to eat she said behind her hand its perfectly all right not the least bit poisonous or enchanted i can tell i learned how when i was staying with queen achren and learning to be a sorceress what you do is now my sparrow orddu interrupted you must tell us all about dear little dallben what is he doing does he still have the book of three well why yes he does taran said with some confusion beginning to wonder if the enchantresses did not know more about dallben than he did poor little robin remarked orddu and such a heavy book im surprised he would even be able to turn the pages well you see taran said still puzzled the dallben that we know he isnt little i mean hes rather elderly elderly burst out fflewddur hes every bit of three hundred and eighty years old coll himself told me he was such a dear sweet little thing said orwen with a sigh all pink cheeks and chubby fingers i love babies said orgoch smacking her lips his hair is quite gray said taran who could not bring himself to believe these strange creatures were indeed speaking of his old teacher the idea of the learned dallben ever having pink cheeks and chubby fingers was beyond his imagination he has a beard too he added a beard cried orddu whats little dallben doing with a beard why in the world should he want such a thing such a charming little tadpole we found him in the marsh one morning said orwen all by himself in a great wicker basket it was too sweet for words orgoch of course at this orgoch made an irritable noise and her eyes glared from the depths of the hood come now dear orgoch dont look so disagreeable said orddu were all friends together here we can talk about such things now well i shall put it this way and spare orgochs feelings she didnt want to keep him that is not in the usual sense but we did and so we brought the poor fledgling to the cottage he grew very quickly added orwen why it was no time before he was toddling around and talking and doing little errands so kind and polite a perfect joy and you say he has a beard she shook her head curious notion wherever did he find it yes a delightful little sparrow he was said orddu but then she continued with a sad smile there was that distressing accident we were brewing some herbs one morning a rather special potion and dallben sighed orwen sweet little dallben was stirring the kettle for us it was one of those kind thoughtful things he was always doing but when it came to a boil some of it bubbled up and splashed out it burned his poor dear fingers orddu added but he didnt cry no indeed he just popped his fingers into his mouth the brave little starling of course some of the potion was still there and he swallowed it as soon as he did that explained orwen he knew every bit as much as we did it was a magical brew you understand a recipe for wisdom after that orddu went on it was out of the question to keep him with us it would never have been the same no it would never have done at all you cant have that many people knowing that much all under the same roof especially since he was able to guess some of the things orgoch had in mind and so we had to let him go really let him go that is orgoch by this time was the one who wanted to keep him in her own fashion which i doubt he would have liked he would have been a sweet little thing murmured orgoch i must say we did quite handsomely by him orddu continued we gave him his choice of a harp a sword or the book of three had he chosen the harp he could have been the greatest bard in the world the sword and the dear duckling could have ruled all prydain but orddu said he chose the book of three and to tell the truth we were just as happy that he did for it was heavy and moldy and did nothing but gather dust and so he left to make his way in the world and that was the last we saw of him a good thing sweet dear dallben isnt here fflewddur chuckled to taran their description hardly matches i fear they might be rather startled taran had been silent throughout orddus account wondering how he dared bring up the matter of the cauldron dallben has been my master as long as i can remember he said at last deciding frankness was the best way to go about it especially since the enchantresses seemed able to guess when he was not telling the truth if you are as fond of him as i we love him dearly the sweet thing said orddu you can be sure of that then i beg you to help us carry out his wishes and the wishes of gwydion prince of don taran went on he explained what had taken place at the council what they had learned at dark gate and from gwystyl he spoke of the urgency of bringing the cauldron to caer dallben and asked too whether the enchantresses had seen ellidyr orddu shook her head a son of penllarcau no my duck theres been no such person anywhere near if hed come across the marshes wed have been bound to see him we have a lovely view of the fens from the hilltop orwen put in with such enthusiasm that her necklace bounced and rattled you must come and enjoy it indeed youre perfectly welcome to stay as long as you want she added eagerly now that little dallbens gone and found himself a beard too the place isnt half as cheery as it used to be we wouldnt change you into a toad unless you insisted on it stay by all means croaked orgoch with a leer our task is to regain the cauldron taran pressed preferring to overlook orgochs remark from what gwystyl told us you said his crow told you my lamb interrupted orddu dont believe everything you hear from a crow doli of the fair folk believed him taran said do you tell me now that you have no cauldron i ask you this in the name of dallben himself cauldron answered orddu why goodness we have dozens cauldrons kettles cook pots we can hardly keep track of them all i speak of the cauldron of annuvin taran said firmly the cauldron of arawn and his deathless warriors oh said orddu laughing cheerfully you must mean the black crochan i do not know its name taran said but that may be the one we seek are you sure you wouldnt prefer one of the others asked orwen theyre much more attractive than that old thing and much more practical what use have you for cauldronborn they would only be a nuisance we can give you a kettle to brew the most marvelous sleeping potions or one you can sprinkle on daffodils to take away that bilious yellow our concern is with the black crochan taran insisted deciding this was indeed the name of arawns cauldron will you not tell me the truth is the cauldron here of course its here replied orddu why not since it was ours to begin with and always has been yours cried taran then arawn stole it from you stole orddu answered not exactly no we couldnt say it was stolen but you couldnt have given it to arawn eilonwy cried knowing what he meant to use it for even arawn had to be allowed to have his chance said orddu tolerantly one day youll understand why for there is a destiny laid on everything on big ugly crochans as well as poor little ducklings and a destiny laid even on us besides arawn paid dearly for the use of it very dearly indeed you can be sure the details my duckling are of a private nature which does not concern you in any case the crochan was not to be his forever arawn swore to return it after a time said orwen but when the time came he broke his oath to us as might be expected illadvised murmured orgoch and since he wouldnt give it back orddu said what else could we do we went and took it great belin cried the bard you three ladies ventured into the heart of annuvin and carried the thing out how did you ever manage orddu smiled there are a number of ways my curious sparrow we could have flooded annuvin with darkness and floated the cauldron out we could have put all the guards to sleep or we could have turned ourselves into well no matter let us say we could have used a variety of methods in any case the cauldron is here again and the enchantress added here it will stay no no she said raising a hand to taran i can see youd like to have it but thats out of the question much too dangerous for wandering chicks like you my goodness we shouldnt sleep at night no no not even for the sake of little dallben in fact orddu went on youd be much safer being toads than having anything to do with the black crochan she shook her head better yet we could change you into birds and have you fly back to caer dallben immediately no indeed she continued rising from the table and taking hold of tarans shoulders off you ducklings must go and never give a second thought to the crochan tell dear little dallben and prince gwydion were terribly sorry and if theres anything else we can possibly do but not that oh my no taran started to protest but orddu cut him short and guided him rapidly to the door while the other enchantresses hustled the companions after him you may sleep in the shed tonight my chickens said orddu then first thing in the morning away with you to little dallben and you shall decide whether youd rather go on your legs or she added this time without a smile on a pair of your own wings or muttered orgoch hopping all the way chapter the plan the door slammed shut behind them and once again the companions found themselves outside the cottage well i like that eilonwy cried indignantly after all their talk of dear little dallben and sweet little dallben theyve turned us out better turned out than into if you take my meaning said the bard a fflam is always kind to animals but somehow i cant bring myself to feel i should like to actually become one no oh no gurgi cried fervently gurgi too wants to stay as he is bold and clever taran turned back to the cottage and began pounding on the door they must listen to us he declared they didnt even take time to think it over but the door did not open and though he ran to the window and rapped long and loud the enchantresses did not show themselves again im afraid thats your answer said fflewddur theyve said all they intend to say and perhaps its for the best and i have the uneasy feeling all that knocking and thumping might well you dont know but what those ah ladies get upset at noises we cant just go away taran replied the cauldron is in their hands and friends of dallben or not theres no telling what theyll do with it i fear them and i distrust them you heard the way the one called orgoch was talking yes i can well imagine what shed have done to dallben he shook his head gravely this is what gwydion warned against whoever has the cauldron can be a mortal threat to prydain if they choose to be at least ellidyr hasnt found it eilonwy said thats something to be grateful for if you want the advice of one who is after all the oldest of us here said the bard i think we should do well to hurry home and let dallben and gwydion attend to the matter after all dallben should know how to deal with those three no taran answered that i will not do we should lose precious days in travel the huntsmen failed to get the cauldron back but who knows what arawn will attempt next no we dare not leave the thing here for once declared eilonwy i agree weve come this far and we shall have to go on to the end i dont trust those enchantresses either they wouldnt sleep if they thought we had the cauldron i shall certainly have nightmares if i think of them with it not to mention arawn i believe no one human or otherwise should have that much power she shuddered ugh there go the ants on my back again yes well its true fflewddur began but the fact remains they have that wretched pot and we dont theyre there and were here and it looks very much as though it will stay that way taran was thoughtful a moment when arawn wouldnt give the cauldron back to them he said they went and took it now since they wont let us have the cauldron i see only one way we shall have to take it steal it cried the bard his worried expression changed rapidly and his eyes brightened i mean he dropped his voice to a whisper steal it now theres a thought he went on eagerly never occurred to me yes yes thats the way he added with excitement now that has some style and flair to it one difficulty eilonwy said we dont know where theyve hidden the cauldron and they evidently arent going to let us in to find out taran frowned i wish doli were here wed have no trouble at all i dont know there must be some way they told us we could stay the night he continued that gives us from now until dawn come lets not stand in front of their cottage or theyll know were up to something orddu spoke of a shed the companions led their horses to the side of the hill where a low dilapidated building tottered shakily on the turf it was bare and bleak and the autumn wind whistled through the chinks in the earthen wall the bard stamped his feet and beat his arms chilly spot to plan anything he remarked those enchantresses may have a lovely view of the marshes but its a cold one i wish we had some straw eilonwy said or anything to keep us warm well freeze before we have a chance to think of anything at all gurgi will find straw gurgi suggested he scurried out of the shed and ran toward the chicken roost taran paced back and forth well have to get into the cottage as soon as theyre asleep he shook his head and fingered the brooch at his throat but how adaons clasp has given me no idea the dreams i had of the cauldron are without meaning to me if i could only understand them suppose you dozed off right now said fflewddur helpfully and slept as fast as you could as hard as you could i mean you might find the answer im not sure replied taran it doesnt quite work that way it should be a lot easier than boring a hole through the hill said the bard which was my next suggestion we could block up their chimney and smoke them out eilonwy said then one of us could sneak into the cottage no she added on second thought im afraid anything we might put down their chimney well they could very likely put something worse up besides they dont have a chimney so we shall have to forget that idea gurgi meantime had returned with a huge armload of straw from the chicken roost and the companions gratefully began heaping it on the clay floor while gurgi went off again to fetch another load taran looked dubiously at the straggly pile i suppose i could try to dream he said without much hope i certainly havent a better suggestion we can bed you down very nicely said fflewddur and while youre dreaming the rest of us will be thinking too that way we can all be working after our own fashion i dont mind telling you he added i wish i had adaons brooch sleep i wouldnt need to be asked twice for im weary to my bones taran still unsure made ready to settle himself in the straw when gurgi reappeared wideeyed and trembling the creature was so upset he could only gasp and gesture taran sprang to his feet what is it he cried gurgi beckoned them toward the chicken roost and the companions hurried after him the agitated gurgi led them into the wattleanddaub building then slunk back terrified he pointed to the far corner there in the midst of the straw stood a cauldron it was squat and black and half as tall as a man its ugly mouth gaped wide enough to hold a human body the rim of the cauldron was crooked and battered its sides dented and scarred on its lips and on the curve of its belly lay dark brown flecks and stains which taran knew were not rust a long thick handle was braced by a heavy bar two heavy rings like the links of a great chain were set in either side though of iron the cauldron seemed alive grim and brooding with ancient evil the empty mouth caught the chill breeze and a hushed muttering rose from the cauldrons depths like the lost voices of the tormented dead it is the black crochan taran whispered in fear and awe he well understood gurgis terror for the very sight of the cauldron was enough to make him feel an icy hand clutching his heart he turned away hardly daring to look at it any longer fflewddurs face was pale eilonwy put a hand to her mouth in the corner gurgi shivered pitifully though he himself had found it he gave no joyous yelps of triumph instead he sank deeper into the straw and tried to make himself as small as possible yes well i suppose it is indeed replied fflewddur swallowing hard on the other hand he added hopefully perhaps it is not they did say they had a number of other cauldrons and kettles lying about i mean we shouldnt want to make a mistake it is the crochan taran said i have dreamed of it and even if i had not i would know it still for i can sense the evil in it i too murmured eilonwy it is full of death and suffering i understand why gwydion wants to destroy it she turned to taran you were right in seeking it without delay eilonwy added with a shudder ill take back all the things i said the crochan must be destroyed as soon as possible yes fflewddur sighed im afraid this is the crochan itself why couldnt it have been a nice little kettle instead of this ugly hulking brute however he went on taking a deep breath lets snatch it a fflam never hesitates no cried taran putting out a hand to restrain the bard we dare not take it in broad daylight and we mustnt stay here or theyll know weve found it well come back after nightfall with the horses and drag it away for now wed better keep to the shed and act as if nothing has happened the companions quickly returned to the shed once away from the crochan gurgi regained some of his spirits crafty gurgi found it he cried oh yes he always finds what is lost he has found piggies and now he finds a great cauldron of wicked doings and brewings kind master will honor humble gurgi nevertheless his face wrinkled with fear taran gave gurgi a comforting pat on the shoulder yes old friend he said you have helped us more than once but i never would have imagined theyd have hidden the crochan in an empty chicken roost under a pile of dirty straw he shook his head id think theyd want to guard it better not at all said the bard they were very clever they put it in one of the first places anybody would look knowing quite well it was so easy nobody would ever think of looking there perhaps taran said he frowned or perhaps he added unable to stifle the dread suddenly filling him they meant us to find it in the shed the companions tried to sleep knowing the night to come would be one of hard and dangerous labor fflewddur and gurgi dozed briefly eilonwy huddled in her cloak with some straw piled around her taran was too restless and uneasy even to close his eyes he sat silently in his hands a long coil of rope he had taken from what little gear remained to the companions they had decided to sling the cauldron between the two horses and make their way from the marshes into the safe shelter of the forest where they would destroy the crochan no sign of life came from the cottage at nightfall however a candle suddenly glowed in the window taran rose quietly and moved stealthily out of the shed clinging to the shadows he made his way to the low building and peered in for a moment he stood there amazed unable to move then he turned and raced back to the others as quickly as he could i saw them in there he whispered rousing the bard and gurgi they arent the same ones at all what cried eilonwy are you sure you didnt stumble on a different cottage of course i didnt retorted taran and if you dont believe me go and look for yourself they arent the same there are three of them yes but theyre different one of them was carding wool one of them was spinning and the third was weaving i suppose really said the bard it passes the time for them theres little enough to do in the middle of these dismal bogs i shall indeed have to see for myself eilonwy declared theres nothing so strange about weaving but beyond that i cant make any sense of what you say with taran leading the companions stole cautiously to the window it was as he had said inside the cottage three figures went about their tasks but not one of them resembled orddu orwen or orgoch theyre beautiful whispered eilonwy ive heard of hags trying to disguise themselves as beautiful maidens murmured the bard but ive never heard of beautiful maidens wanting to disguise themselves as hags it isnt natural and i dont mind telling you it makes me edgy i think wed better seize the cauldron and be gone i dont know who they are said taran but i fear they are more powerful than we could even guess somehow weve fallen on something i dont know what it troubles me yes we must take the cauldron as soon as we can but we shall wait until theyre asleep if they sleep said the bard now that ive seen this nothing would surprise me not even if they hung by their toes all night like bats for a long time taran feared the bard was right and that the enchantresses might not sleep at all the companions took turns watching the cottage and it was not until almost dawn that the candle finally winked out in an agony of waiting taran still delayed soon a loud snoring rose from within they must have gone back to themselves again remarked the bard i cant imagine beautiful ladies snoring like that no its orgoch id recognize that snort anywhere in the still shadows of the false dawn the companions hastened to the chicken roost where eilonwy ventured to light her bauble the crochan squatted in its corner black and baleful hurry now taran ordered taking hold of the handle fflewddur and eilonwy pick up those rings and gurgi lift the other side well haul it out and rope it to the horses ready all lift together the companions gave a mighty heave then nearly fell to the ground the cauldron had not moved its heavier than i thought said taran try again he made to shift his grip on the handle but his hands would not come free in a spurt of fear he tried to pull away it was in vain i say muttered the bard i seem to be caught on something so am i eilonwy cried struggling to tear her hands loose and gurgi is caught howled the terrified gurgi oh sorrow he can not move desperately the companions flung themselves back and forth fighting against the mute iron enemy taran wrenched and tugged until he sobbed for lack of strength eilonwy had dropped in exhaustion her hands still on the heavy ring once again taran strained to break free the black crochan held him fast a figure in a long night robe appeared at the doorway its orddu cried the bard well be toads for sure chapter the price orddu blinking sleepily and looking more disheveled than ever stepped inside the chicken roost behind her followed the other two enchantresses also in flapping night robes their hair unbound and falling about their shoulders in a mass of snarls and tangles they had again taken the shapes of crones in no way resembling the maidens taran had spied through the window orddu raised a sputtering candle above her head and peered at the companions oh the poor lambs she cried what have they gone and done we tried to warn them about the nasty crochan but the headstrong little goslings wouldnt listen my oh my she clucked sorrowfully now theyve got their little fingers caught dont you think said orgoch in a croaking whisper we should start the fire orddu turned to her do be silent orgoch she cried what a dreadful thought its much too early for breakfast never too early muttered orgoch look at them orddu went on fondly theyre so charming when theyre frightened like birdlings without their feathers you have tricked us orddu taran cried you knew wed find the cauldron and you knew what would happen why of course we did my chicken orddu replied sweetly we were only curious to find out what youd do when you did find it and now youve found it and now we know taran struggled desperately to free himself despite his terror he flung back his head and glared defiantly at orddu kill us if you choose you evil hags he cried yes we would have stolen the cauldron and destroyed it and so shall i try again as long as i live taran threw himself furiously against the immovable crochan and once again with all his strength tried vainly to wrest it from the ground i love to see them get angry dont you orwen whispered happily to orgoch do take care orddu advised taran or youll harm yourself with all that thrashing about we forgive you for calling us hags she added indulgently youre upset poor chicken and liable to say anything you are evil creatures taran cried do with us what you will but sooner or later you shall be overcome gwydion shall learn of our fate and dallben yes yes shouted gurgi they will find you oh yes with great fightings and smitings my dear pullets replied orddu you still dont understand do you evil why bless your little thumping hearts we arent evil i should hardly call this good muttered the bard not at least from a personal point of view of course not agreed orddu were neither good nor evil were simply interested in things as they are and things as they are at the moment seem to be that youre caught by the crochan and you dont care cried eilonwy thats worse than being evil certainly we care my dear orwen said soothingly its that we dont care in quite the same way you do or rather care isnt really a feeling we can have come now said orddu dont trouble your thoughts with such matters weve been talking and talking and we have some pleasant news for you bring the crochan outdoors its so stuffy and eggy in here and we shall tell you go ahead she added you can lift it now taran cast orddu a distrustful glance but ventured to put his weight against the cauldron it moved and he discovered too his hands were free with much labor the companions managed to raise the heavy crochan and carry it from the chicken roost outside the sun had already risen as the companions set the cauldron on the ground and quickly drew away the rays of dawn turned the black iron as red as blood yes now as i was saying orddu continued while taran and his companions rubbed their aching arms and hands weve talked it over and we agree even orgoch agrees that you shall have the crochan if you truly want it youll let us take it cried taran after all youve done quite so replied orddu the crochan is useless except for making cauldronborn arawn has spoiled it for anything else as you might imagine its sad it should be so but thats the way things are now i assure you cauldronborn are the last creatures in the world we should want around here weve decided the crochan is nothing but a bother to us and since youre friends of dallben youre giving us the crochan taran began in astonishment delighted to oblige you ladies said the bard gently gently my ducklings orddu interrupted give you the crochan oh goodness no we never give anything only what is worth earning is worth having but we shall allow you the opportunity to buy it we have no treasures to bargain with taran said in dismay alas that we do not we couldnt expect you to pay as much as arawn did replied orddu but were sure you can find something to offer in exchange oh shall we say the north wind in a bag the north wind taran exclaimed impossible how could you ever dream very well said orddu we shant be difficult the south wind then its much gentler you make sport of us taran cried angrily the price you ask is beyond what any of us can pay orddu hesitated possibly youre right she admitted well then something a little more personal i have it she said beaming at taran give us give us the nicest summer day you can remember you cant say thats hard since it belongs to you yes orwen said eagerly a lovely summer afternoon full of sunlight and sleepy scents theres nothing so sweet murmured orgoch sucking a tooth as a tender young lambs summer afternoon how can i give you that protested taran or any other day when theyre theyre inside of me somewhere you cant get them out i mean we could try orgoch muttered orddu sighed patiently very well my goslings weve made our suggestions and were willing to listen to yours but mind you if its to be a fair exchange it must be something you prize as much as the crochan i prize my sword taran said it is a gift from dallben and the first blade that is truly mine for the crochan i would gladly part with it he began quickly to unbuckle his belt but orddu waved an uninterested hand a sword she answered shaking her head goodness no my duck we already have so many too many in fact and some of them famous weapons of mighty warriors then said taran with hesitation i offer you lluagor she is a noble animal he paused seeing orddus frown or he added reluctantly in a low voice there is my horse melynlas a colt of melyngar prince gwydions own steed none is faster or more surefooted i treasure melynlas beyond all others horses said orddu no that wont do at all such a bother feeding them and caring for them besides with orgoch its difficult to keep pets about taran was silent for a moment his face paled as he thought of adaons brooch and his hand went protectively to it all that remains to me he began slowly no no gurgi cried thrusting his way toward the enchantress and brandishing his wallet take gurgis own great treasure take bag of crunchings and munchings not food said orddu that wont do either the only one of us who has the slightest interest in food is orgoch and im sure your wallet holds nothing to tempt her gurgi looked at orddu in dismay but it is all poor gurgi has to give he held out the wallet once again the enchantress smiled and shook her head gurgis hands fell to his sides his shoulders drooped and he turned mournfully away you must like jewelry eilonwy put in quickly she pulled the ring from her finger and offered it to orddu this is a lovely thing eilonwy said prince gwydion gave it to me do you see the stone it was carved by the fair folk orddu took the ring held it close to her eye and squinted lovely lovely she said so pretty almost as pretty as you my lamb but so much older no im afraid not we have a number of them too we really dont want any more keep it my chick one day you may find some use for it but we surely wont she gave back the ring to eilonwy who sadly replaced it on her finger i do have something else i treasure eilonwy went on she reached into the folds of her cloak and brought out the golden sphere here she said turning it in her hands so that it shone with a bright glow its much better than just a light eilonwy said you see things differently in it clearer somehow its very useful how sweet of you to offer it to us said orddu but there again its something we dont really need ladies ladies cried fflewddur youve overlooked a most excellent bargain he stepped forward and unslung his harp i quite understand that bags of food and all such couldnt possibly interest you but i ask you to consider this harp youre alone in this gloomy fen he went on and a little music should be just the thing the harp almost plays of itself fflewddur continued he put the beautifully curved instrument to his shoulder barely touched the strings and a long lovely melody filled the air you see cried the bard nothing to it oh it is nice orwen murmured wistfully and think of the songs we could sing to keep ourselves company orddu peered closely at the harp i notice a good many of the strings are badly knotted has the weather got into them no not exactly the weather said the bard with me they tend to break frequently but only when i only when i color the facts a bit im sure you ladies wouldnt have that kind of trouble i can understand you should prize it orddu said but if we want music we can always send for a few birds no all things considered it would be a nuisance keeping it in tune and so on are you certain you have nothing else orwen asked hopefully thats all said the disappointed bard absolutely everything unless you want the cloaks off our backs bless you no said orddu it wouldnt be proper in the least for you ducklings to go without them youd perish with the cold and what good would the crochan be to you then im terribly sorry my chicks orddu went on it does indeed seem you have nothing to interest us very well we shall keep the crochan and you shall be on your way chapter the black cauldron farewell my owlets orddu said turning toward the cottage unfortunate you couldnt strike a bargain with us but that too is the way things are flutter home to your nest and give all our love to little dallben wait taran called and strode after her eilonwy realizing his intent cried out in protest and caught his arm gently taran put her aside orddu stopped and looked back at him there is there is one thing more taran said in a low voice he stiffened and took a deep breath the brooch i wear the gift of adaon son of taliesin brooch said orddu eyeing him curiously a brooch indeed yes that might be more interesting just the thing perhaps you should have mentioned it sooner taran lifted his head and his eyes met orddus for that instant it seemed to him they were quite alone he raised his hand slowly to his throat and felt the power of the brooch working within him you have been toying with us orddu he whispered you saw that i wore adaons clasp from the moment we came here you knew it for what it was does that matter orddu replied it is still your choice whether you will bargain with it yes we know the brooch well menwy son of teirgwaedd first of the bards fashioned it long ago you could have slain us taran murmured and taken the clasp orddu smiled sadly do you not understand poor chicken like knowledge truth and love themselves the clasp must be given willingly or its power is broken and it is indeed filled with power this too you must understand for menwy the bard cast a mighty spell on it and filled it with dreams wisdom and vision with such a clasp a duckling could win much glory and honor who can tell he might rival all the heroes of prydain even gwydion prince of don think carefully duckling orddu said once given up it shall not come to you again will you exchange it for an evil cauldron you intend only to destroy as he held the brooch taran recalled with bitter clarity the joys of sight and scent of dewdrops on a spider web his rescue of the companions from the rock fall of gurgi praising his wisdom the admiring eyes of eilonwy and adaon who had entrusted the brooch to him once more there came to him the pride of strength and knowledge at his feet the ugly cauldron seemed to mock him taran nodded barely able to speak yes he said heavily this shall be my bargain slowly he undid the clasp at his throat as he dropped the bit of iron into orddus outstretched hand it was as though a light flickered and died in his heart and he nearly cried out with the anguish of it done my chicken orddu cried the brooch for the crochan about him the companions stood in silence and dismay tarans hands clenched the crochan is ours he said looking orddu full in the face is this not so it is ours to do with as we please why of course dear fledgling orddu said we never break a bargain its yours entirely no question of it in your stables taran said i saw hammers and iron bars will you grant us the use of them or he added bitterly must we pay still another price use them by all means replied orddu well count that as part of the bargain for you are a bold chicken we must admit taran led the companions to the stable and there he paused i understand what you were all trying to do he said quietly taking their hands in turn each of you would have given up what you treasured most for my sake im glad orddu didnt take your harp fflewddur he added i know how unhappy youd be without your music even more than i without my brooch and gurgi you should never have tried to sacrifice your food on my account and eilonwy your ring and your bauble are much too useful and beautiful to exchange for an ugly crochan all of these things taran said are doubly precious now and so are you the best of true comrades he seized a heavy hammer that was leaning against the wall come now friends we have a task to finish armed with iron bars and sledges the companions hurried back to the cottage and while the enchantresses looked on curiously taran raised his hammer with all his strength he brought it down on the crochan the hammer rebounded the cauldron rang like a deep bell of doom but remained undented with a cry of anger taran struck again the bard and eilonwy added a fury of blows while gurgi belabored the cauldron with an iron bar despite their efforts the cauldron showed not the slightest damage drenched and exhausted taran leaned on his hammer and wiped his streaming face you should have told us my goslings what you intended orddu called you cant do that to the crochan you know the cauldron belongs to us retorted eilonwy taran has paid more than enough its our business if we want to smash it naturally replied orddu and youre quite welcome to hammer and kick it from now until the birds start nesting again but my silly goslings youll never destroy the crochan that way goodness no youre going at it all wrong gurgi about to crawl inside the crochan and attack it from within stopped to listen while orddu continued since the crochan is yours she said youre entitled to know how to dispose of it theres only one way though very simple and neat it is then tell us taran cried so that we may put an end to the evil thing a living person must climb into it orddu said when he does the crochan will shatter but she added theres only one disagreeable thing about that the poor duckling who climbs in will never climb out again alive with a yelp of terror gurgi sprang from the cauldron and scuttled to a safe distance where he furiously brandished his iron bar and shook his fist at the crochan yes said orddu with a smile thats the way of it the crochan only cost you a brooch but it will cost a life to destroy it not only that but whoever gives up his life to the crochan must give it willingly knowing full well what he does and now my chickens she went on we must really say farewell orgoch is dreadfully sleepy you had us up so early you know farewell farewell she waved a hand and with the other enchantresses turned to enter the cottage stop taran shouted tell us is there no other way he ran to the doorway orddus head popped out for an instant none whatever my chicken she said and for the first time there was a hint of pity in her voice the door snapped shut in tarans face he pounded in vain no further reply came from the enchantresses and even the window suddenly darkened with an impenetrable black fog when orddu and her friends say farewell remarked the bard they mean it i doubt we shall see them again he brightened and thats the most cheerful piece of news ive had this morning taran wearily dropped his hammer to the ground surely there must be something else we can do though we can not destroy the crochan we dare not part with it hide it suggested fflewddur bury it and i should say as soon as possible you can be quite certain we wont find anyone eager to jump into the thing and break it for us taran shook his head no we can not hide it sooner or later arawn would find it and all our efforts would have been useless dallben will know he went on he alone has the wisdom to deal with the cauldron gwydion himself planned to bring the crochan to caer dallben now that must be our task fflewddur nodded i suppose thats the only safe thing but its a cumbersome beast i dont see the four of us lugging it along some of those mountain trails in front of the silent cottage the companions led out lluagor and melynlas and lashed the cauldron between the two steeds gurgi and eilonwy guided the heavily laden horses while taran and the bard walked one in front one behind to steady the crochan though eager to be gone from orddus cottage taran did not dare venture across the marshes of morva again instead he determined the companions would travel some distance from the edges of the swamp keeping to solid ground and following a path halfcircling the bog until they reached the moors its longer taran said but the marshes are too treacherous last time adaons brooch guided me now he added with a sigh im afraid id lead us to the same fate as the huntsmen thats rather a good idea cried the bard not for us he added quickly for the crochan sink the beastly pot in the quicksand no thank you answered eilonwy by the time we found quicksand wed be sinking along with the crochan if youre tired we can change off and you lead melynlas not at all not at all grunted fflewddur its not as heavy as all that in fact i find the exercise bracing quite invigorating a fflam never flags at this a harp string broke but the bard gave it no heed busy as he was in holding his side of the swaying cauldron taran trudged in silence speaking only to call directions to eilonwy and gurgi they continued with few moments of rest throughout the day nevertheless by sunset taran realized they had covered only a little distance and had barely reached the broad moorlands he was aware too of his own fatigue heavy as the crochan itself a weariness he had never noticed while he had worn adaons brooch they camped on an open heath cold and barren shrouded with mist drifting from the marshes of morva there they unroped the crochan from the tired horses and gurgi brought out food from the wallet after the meal fflewddurs spirits revived although shivering in the chill and dampness the bard put his harp to his shoulder and attempted to cheer the companions with a merry song taran usually eager to listen to the bards music sat apart gloomily watching the cauldron after a time eilonwy drew near and put her hand on his shoulder i realize its no consolation to you she said but if you look at it in one way you didnt give up a thing to the enchantresses not really you did exchange the clasp and everything that went along with it but dont you see all those things came from the clasp itself they werent inside of you i think she added it would have been much worse giving up a summer day thats part of you i mean i know i shouldnt want to give up a single one of mine or even a winter day for the matter of that so when you come right down to it orddu didnt take anything from you why youre still yourself and you cant deny that yes taran answered i am still only an assistant pig keeper i should have known that anything else was too good to last that may be true said eilonwy but as far as being an assistant pigkeeper is concerned i think youre a perfectly marvelous one believe me theres no question in my mind youre the best assistant pigkeeper in all prydain how many others there are im sure i dont know but thats beside the point and i doubt a single one of them would have done what you did i could not have done otherwise taran said not if we were to gain the cauldron orddu said they were interested in things as they are he went on i believe now they are concerned with things as they must be adaon knew there was a destiny laid on him taran continued turning to eilonwy his voice growing firmer and he did not turn from it though it cost him his life very well he declared if there is a destiny laid on me i shall face it i hope only that i may face it as well as adaon did his but dont forget added eilonwy no matter what else happens you won the cauldron for gwydion and dallben and all of us thats one thing nobody can take away from you why for that alone you have every reason to be proud taran nodded yes this much have i done he said no more and eilonwy quietly left him there for long after the others had gone to sleep taran sat staring at the crochan he thought carefully over all eilonwy had told him his despair lightened a little and pride stirred within him soon the cauldron would be in gwydions hands and the long task ended this much have i done taran repeated to himself and new strength budded in his heart nevertheless as the wind moaned across the heath and the crochan loomed before him like an iron shadow he thought once again of the brooch and he buried his face in his hands and wept chapter the river his nights sleep refreshed taran but little and hardly blunted the edge of his weariness nevertheless at dawn he roused the companions and with much effort they began roping the crochan to lluagor and melynlas when they finished taran glanced around him uneasily there is no concealment for us on these moors he said i had hoped we might keep to the flatlands where our journey would be easier but i fear that arawn will have his gwythaints seeking the crochan sooner or later they will find us and here they could fall on us like hawks on chickens please dont mention chickens said the bard with a sour grimace i had quite enough of that from orddu gurgi will protect kind master shouted gurgi taran smiled and put a hand on gurgis shoulder i know youll do your best he said but all of us together are no match for even one gwythaint taran shook his head no he said reluctantly i think we had better turn north to the forest of idris its the longest way around but at least it would give us some cover eilonwy agreed its not usually wise to go in the direction opposite to where you want to be she said but you can be sure id rather not fight gwythaints lead on then said fflewddur a fflam never falters though what my aching bones might do is another matter crossing the moorlands the companions journeyed without difficulties but once within the forest of idris the crochan grew more burdensome although the trees and bushes offered concealment and protection the paths were narrow lluagor and melynlas stumbled often and despite their most valiant efforts they could barely drag the cauldron through the brush taran called a halt our horses have borne all they can he said patting the lathered neck of melynlas now it is our turn to help them i wish doli were here he sighed im sure hed find an easier way of carrying the crochan hed think of something clever like making a sling out of branches and vines there cried eilonwy youve just said it yourself youre doing amazingly well without adaons brooch with their swords taran and the bard cut stout branches while eilonwy and gurgi stripped vines from the tree trunks tarans spirits lifted when he saw the sling take shape according to his plan the companions hoisted up the crochan and set off again but even with the sling and all their strength their progress was slow and painful oh poor weary arms moaned gurgi oh moilings and toilings this evil pot is a cruel and wicked master to us all oh sorrow fainting gurgi will never leave caer dallben again unbidden taran gritted his teeth as the rough branches bit into his shoulders to him too it seemed as if the ugly heavy cauldron had gained some strange life of its own the crochan squat and blooddarkened lurched behind him as he stumbled through the brush it caught on jutting tree limbs as though eagerly clutching them to itself often at these sudden checks the companions lost their footing and went sprawling then laboriously they were obliged to set the crochan back in its sling once again though the weather was chill enough to turn their breath white their clothing was drenched with sweat and nearly ripped to shreds by the grasping brambles the trees had begun to grow more dense and the ground rose toward the comb of a hill for taran the crochan seemed to gain weight with every pace its leering gaping mouth taunted him and the cauldron dragged at his strength as he heaved and struggled along the ascending trail the companions had nearly reached the crest of the hill when one of the carrier branches snapped the crochan plunged to the ground and taran fell headlong painfully picking himself up and rubbing his shoulder he stared at the spiteful cauldron and shook his head no use taran gasped well never get it through the forest no sense trying you sound like gwystyl eilonwy remarked if i didnt have my eyes open i could barely tell the difference gwystyl cried the bard looking ruefully at his blistered hands i envy that fellow in his rabbit warren sometimes i think he had quite the right idea we are too few to carry such a burden taran said hopelessly with another horse or another pair of hands there might be a chance we are only deceiving ourselves if we think we can bring the crochan to caer dallben that may be true eilonwy sighed wearily but i dont know what else we can do except keep on deceiving ourselves and perhaps by that time well be home taran cut a new branch for the sling but his heart was as heavy as the crochan itself and as the companions wrestled their burden over the hill and descended into a deep valley taran nearly sank to the ground in despair before them like a brown menacing serpent stretched a turbulent river taran stared grimly at the choppy waters for a moment then turned away there is a destiny laid on us that the crochan shall never reach caer dallben nonsense cried eilonwy if you stop now then youve given up adaons brooch for nothing thats worse than putting a necklace on an owl and letting it fly away if im not mistaken said fflewddur helpfully that must be the river tevvyn ive crossed it farther to the north where it takes its source surprising the bits of information you pick up as a wandering bard alas it does us no good my friend taran said unless we could turn north again and cross where the river is less wide afraid that wouldnt answer said fflewddur wed have the mountains to go over that way if were to cross at all we shall have to do it here it seems a little shallower down that way said eilonwy pointing to a spot where the river curved around a sedge covered bank very well taran of caer dallben she said what shall it be we cant just sit here until gwythaints or something even more disagreeable find us and we certainly cant go back to orddu and offer to exchange the crochan again taran took a deep breath if you are all willing he said we shall try to cross slowly struggling under the cruel weight the companions brought the crochan to the riverbank while gurgi leading the horses cautiously set one foot then the other into the stream taran and the bard shouldered the sling eilonwy followed beside them to steady the swaying cauldron the icy water slashed at tarans legs like a knife he dug his heels into the river bed seeking a firmer foothold he plunged deeper behind him the straining grunting fflewddur did his best to avoid dropping his end of the sling the chill of the river took tarans breath away his head spun the branches nearly slipped from his numb fingers for one moment of terror he felt himself falling his foot found a rock and he braced himself on it the vines creaked and tensed as the weight of the cauldron shifted the companions were in midstream now and the water rose only to their waists taran raised his streaming face the opposite bank was not far the ground appeared smoother the forest not as dense soon there he cried taking heart anew gurgi he saw had already led the horses from the water and was turning back to help the toiling companions closer to the bank the river bottom turned stony blindly taran picked his way through the treacherous rocks ahead rose a number of high boulders and he warily guided the crochan past them gurgi was reaching out his hands when taran heard a sharp cry from the bard the cauldron lurched with all his strength taran heaved forward eilonwy seized the cauldron by its handle and tugged desperately taran flung himself to dry ground the crochan rolled to its side and sank in the muddy shallows taran turned back to help fflewddur the bard who had fallen heavily against the boulders was struggling to shore his face was white with pain his right arm hung uselessly at his side is it broken is it broken fflewddur moaned as taran and eilonwy hurried to lead him up the bank ill be able to tell in a moment taran said helping the stumbling bard to sit down and prop his back against an alder he opened fflewddurs cloak slit the sleeve of the jacket and carefully examined the damaged arm taran saw quickly that the bards fall had not only been severe but that one of the cauldrons legs had given him a deep gash in his side yes taran said gravely im afraid it is at this the bard set up a loud lament and bowed his head terrible terrible he groaned a fflam is always cheerful but this is too much to bear it was a bad accident eilonwy said trying to hide her concern but you mustnt take on so it can be fixed well bind it up useless cried fflewddur in despair it will never be the same oh it is the fault of that beastly crochan the wretched thing struck at me deliberately im sure youll be all right i promise you taran reassured the sorrowful bard he tore several wide strips from his cloak good as new in a little while he added of course you wont be able to move your arm until its healed arm cried fflewddur its not my arm that worries me its my harp your harp is in a better state than you are said eilonwy taking the bards instrument from his shoulder and putting it in his lap great belin but you gave me a shock fflewddur said caressing the harp with his free hand arms naturally they heal themselves with no trouble at all ive had a dozen broken yes well that is to say i snapped my wrist once during a little sword play in any case i have two arms but only one harp the bard heaved an immense sigh of relief indeed i feel better already despite fflewddurs brave grin taran saw the bard was suffering more than he chose to admit quickly and gently taran finished making a splint and winding the strips about it then brought herbs from lluagors saddlebag chew these he told fflewddur they will ease your pain and youd better stay perfectly still for a while lie still cried the bard not now of all times we must fish that vile pot out of the river taran shook his head the three of us will try to raise it with a broken arm even a fflam wouldnt be much help by no means cried fflewddur a fflam is always helpful he struggled to raise himself from the ground winced and fell back again gasping with the pain of his exertion he looked dolefully at his injury taran uncoiled the ropes and with gurgi and eilonwy following made his way to the shallows the crochan lay half submerged in the water the current eddied around its gaping mouth and the cauldron seemed to be muttering defiance the sling taran saw was undamaged but the cauldron was caught firmly between the boulders he looped a rope and cast it over a jutting leg directing gurgi and eilonwy to pull when he signaled he waded into the river bent and tried to thrust his shoulder under the cauldron gurgi and eilonwy hauled with all their strength the crochan did not move soaked to the skin his hands numb taran wrestled vainly with the cauldron breathless he staggered back to shore where he attached ropes to lluagor and melynlas once again taran returned to the icy stream he shouted to eilonwy who led the horses away from the river the ropes tightened the steeds labored taran heaved and tugged at the immovable cauldron the bard had managed to regain his feet and lent what effort he could gurgi and eilonwy took their places in the water beside taran but the crochan resisted the force of all their muscles in despair taran signaled for them to stop heavyhearted the companions returned to shore we shall camp here for the rest of the day taran said tomorrow when we have our strength back we can try again there may be some other way of getting it out i dont know it is tightly wedged and everything we do seems to make it worse he looked toward the river where the cauldron crouched like a glowering beast of prey it is a thing of evil taran said and has brought nothing but evil now at the last i fear it has defeated us he turned away behind him the bushes rustled taran spun around his hand on his sword a figure stepped from the edge of the forest chapter the choice it was ellidyr with islimach following he strode to the riverbank dry mud caked his tawny hair and grimed his face his cheeks and hands had been cruelly slashed his bloodstained jacket was half ripped from his shoulders and he wore no cloak darkringed his eyes glittered feverishly ellidyr halted before the speechless companions threw back his head and glanced scornfully at them well met he said in a hoarse voice brave company of scarecrows his lips drew back in a taut bitter grin the pigboy the scullery maid i do not see the dreamer what do you here taran cried facing him angrily you dare speak of adaon he is slain and lies beneath his burial mound you have betrayed us son of penllarcau where were you when the huntsmen set upon us when another sword would have turned the balance the price was adaons life a better man than you shall ever be ellidyr did not reply but moved stiffly past taran and squatted down near the pile of saddlebags give me food he said sharply roots and rain water have been my meat and drink evil traitor shouted gurgi leaping to his feet there are no crunchings and munchings for wicked villain no no hold your tongue said ellidyr or you shall hold your head give him food as he asks taran ordered muttering furiously gurgi obeyed and opened the wallet and just because were feeding you cried eilonwy dont think youre welcome to it the scullery maid is not pleased to see me said ellidyr she shows temper cant say i really blame her rejoined fflewddur and i dont see that you should expect anything else youve done us a bad turn would you have us hold a festival the harpscraper is still with you at least ellidyr said seizing the food from gurgi but i see he is a bird with the wing down birds again murmured the bard with a shudder shall i never be allowed to forget orddu why do you seek us taran demanded you were content to leave us once what brings you here now seek you ellidyr laughed harshly i seek the marshes of morva well youre a long way from them eilonwy cried but if youre in a hurry to get there as i hope you are ill be glad to give you directions and while youre there i suggest you find orddu orwen and orgoch theyll be happier to see you than we are ellidyr wolfed down his food and settled himself against the saddlebags that is better he said now there is a bit more life in me enough to take you wherever you happen to be going snapped eilonwy and wherever you happen to be going replied ellidyr i wish you the joy of your journey you shall find huntsmen enough to satisfy you what cried taran are the huntsmen still abroad yes pigboy ellidyr answered all annuvin is astir the huntsmen i have outrun a noble game of hare and hounds the gwythaints have had their sport of me he added with a contemptuous laugh though it cost them two of their number but enough remain to offer you good hunting if that is your pleasure i hope you didnt lead them to us eilonwy began i led them nowhere said ellidyr least of all to you since i did not know you were here when the gwythaints and i parted company i assure you i gave little heed to the path i chose you can still choose your path said eilonwy so long as it leads you from us and i hope you follow it as swiftly as you did when you sneaked away sneaked away laughed ellidyr a son of penllarcau does not sneak you were too slowfooted for me there were matters of urgency to attend to your own glory taran replied sharply you thought of nothing else at least ellidyr speak the truth it is true enough i meant to go to the marshes of morva ellidyr said with a bitter smile and true enough i did not find them though i should had the huntsmen not barred my way from the scullery maids words ellidyr went on i gather you have been to morva taran nodded yes we have been there now we return to caer dallben ellidyr laughed again and you too have failed but since your journey was the longer i ask you which of us wasted more of his labor and pains failed cried taran we did not fail the cauldron is ours there it lies he added pointing past the riverbank to the black hump of the crochan ellidyr sprang to his feet and looked across the water how then he shouted wrathfully have you cheated me once more his face darkened with rage do i risk my life again so that a pigboy may rob me of my prize his eyes were frenzied and he made to seize taran by the throat taran struck away his hand i have never cheated you son of penllarcau he cried your prize risk your life we have lost life and shed blood for the cauldron yes a heavy price has been paid heavier than you know prince of pen llarcau ellidyr seemed to strangle on his rage he stood without moving his face working and twitching but he soon forced himself to seem again cold and haughty though his hands still trembled so pigboy he said in a low rasping voice you have found the cauldron after all yet indeed it would seem to belong more to the river than to you who but a pigboy would leave it stranded thus did you not have wits enough or strength enough to smash it that you must bear it with you the crochan can not be destroyed unless a man give up his life in it taran answered we have wits enough to know it must be put safely in dallbens hands would you be a hero pigboy asked ellidyr why do you not climb into it yourself surely you are bold enough or are you a coward at heart when the test is put upon you taran disregarded ellidyrs taunt we need your help he said urgently our strength fails us help us bring the crochan to caer dallben or at least aid us to move it to the riverbank help you ellidyr threw back his head and laughed wildly help you so that a pigboy may strut before gwydion and boast of his deeds and a prince of penllarcau play the churl no you shall have no help from me i warned you to take your own part do it now pigboy eilonwy screamed and pointed to the sky gwythaints a flight of three gwythaints soared high above the trees racing with the winddriven clouds the gigantic birds sped closer taran and eilonwy caught up fflewddur between them and stumbled into the bushes gurgi almost witless with fear pulled on the horses bridles leading them to the safety of the trees while ellidyr followed the gwythaints swooped downward the wind rattling in their flashing feathers with harsh and fearsome shrieking the gwythaints circled around the cauldron blotting out the sun with their black wings one of the ferocious birds came to rest on the crochan and for an instant remained poised there beating its wings the gwythaints made no attempt to attack the companions but circled once again then drove skyward they veered north and the mountains quickly hid them pale and shaking taran stepped from the bushes they have found what they were seeking he said arawn will soon know the crochan waits to be plucked from our hands he turned to ellidyr help us he asked again i beg you we dare not lose a moment ellidyr shrugged and strode down the riverbank into the shallows where he looked closely at the halfsunken crochan it can be moved he said when he returned but not by you pigboy you will need the strength of islimach added to your own steeds and you will need mine lend us your strength then taran pleaded let us raise the crochan and be gone from here before more of arawns servants reach it perhaps i shall perhaps i shall not answered ellidyr with a strange look in his eyes did you pay a price to gain the cauldron very well you shall pay another one hear me pigboy he went on if i help you bear the cauldron to caer dallben it shall be on my own conditions this is no time for conditions cried eilonwy we dont want to listen to your conditions ellidyr well find our own way to get the crochan out or well stay here with it and one of us can go back and bring gwydion stay here and be slain ellidyr replied no it must be done now and done as i say or not at all he turned to taran these are my conditions he said the crochan is mine and you shall be under my command it is i who found it not you pigboy it is i who fought for it and won it so you shall say to gwydion and the others and you shall all swear the most binding oath no we shall not cried eilonwy you ask us to lie so that you may steal the crochan and steal our own efforts with it you are mad ellidyr not mad scullery maid said ellidyr his eyes blazing but weary to my death do you hear me all my life have i been forced into the second rank i have been put aside slighted honor it has been denied me at every turn but this time i shall not let the prize slip from my fingers adaon saw a black beast on your shoulders taran said quietly and i too have seen it i see it now ellidyr i care nothing for your black beast shouted ellidyr i care for my honor do you think taran said i care nothing for mine what is the honor of a pigboy laughed ellidyr compared to the honor of a prince i have paid for my honor answered taran his voice rising more dearly than you would pay for yours do you ask me now to cast it away you pigboy dared reproach me for seeking glory said ellidyr yet you yourself cling to it with your dirty hands i shall not tarry here my terms or nothing make your choice taran stood silent eilonwy seized ellidyr by the jacket how dare you ask such a price ellidyr drew away let the pigboy decide it is up to him whether he will pay it if i swear this taran said turning to the companions you must swear along with me once given i will not break an oath and it would be even more to my shame if i broke this one before i can decide i must know whether you too will bind yourselves on this we must all agree no one spoke at length fflewddur murmured i put the decision in your hands and abide by what you do gurgi nodded his head solemnly i shall not lie eilonwy cried not for this traitor and deserter it is not for him taran said quietly but for the sake of our quest it isnt right eilonwy began tears starting in her eyes we do not speak of rightness taran answered we speak of a task to be finished eilonwy looked away fflewddur has said the choice is yours she murmured at last i must say the same for a long moment taran did not speak all the anguish he had felt when adaons brooch had left his hands returned to him and he recalled eilonwys words in his blackest despair the girls voice telling him that nothing could take away what he had done yet this was the very price ellidyr demanded taran bowed his head the cauldron ellidyr is yours he said slowly we are at your command and all things shall be as you say thus we swear heavyhearted and silent the companions followed ellidyrs orders and once again lashed ropes around the sunken crochan ellidyr hitched the three horses side by side then attached the lines to them while fflewddur held the bridles with his uninjured hand the companions waded into the shallows ellidyr standing up to his knees in the rushing water commanded taran eilonwy and gurgi to post themselves on either side of the crochan and keep it from slipping back against the boulders he signaled an order to the waiting bard then bent to his own task as he had done with melynlas long before ellidyr thrust his shoulders as far below the cauldron as the rocks allowed his body tensed the veins rose to bursting on his streaming forehead still the cauldron did not yield beside him taran and eilonwy heaved vainly at the sling gasping for breath ellidyr turned once more to the crochan the sling creaked against the boulders the ropes strained ellidyrs shoulders were cut and bleeding his face deathly white he choked out another command to the companions his muscles trembled in a final effort with a cry he pitched forward into the water stumbling to gain his balance then he gave an exultant shout the cauldron had lifted free desperately the companions labored to bring the crochan to shore ellidyr seized one end of the sling and thrust ahead the cauldron skidded to dry firm ground on the riverbank they quickly roped the sling between melynlas and lluagor ellidyr hitched up islimach as the leading horse to guide the others and bear a share of the weight until then ellidyrs eyes had burned with triumph but now his face changed my cauldron has been won back from the river he said with a curious glance at taran but i think perhaps i was too hasty you met my terms too quickly he added tell me what is in your mind pigboy rage filled him again i know well enough once more you would try to cheat me you have my oath taran began what is the oath of a pigboy ellidyr said you gave it you will break it speak for yourself eilonwy said angrily thats what you would do prince of penllarcau but we are not like you the cauldron needed all of us to raise it ellidyr continued lowering his voice but does it now need all of us to carry it a few would serve he added yes yes only a few perhaps only one if he were strong enough was my price too low he went on spinning around to face taran ellidyr taran cried you are truly mad yes laughed ellidyr mad to believe your word alone the price must be silence utter silence his hand moved to his sword yes pigboy i knew in time we should have to face one another he lunged forward his sword out and raised before taran could draw his own blade ellidyr swung viciously and pressed to the attack taran stumbled down the riverbank and leaped to a boulder feverishly grasping for his weapon ellidyr strode into the water while the companions raced to stop him as ellidyr swung his blade again taran lost his footing and toppled from the boulder he tried to rise but the stones slipped from under him and he stumbled backward he threw up his hands the current was clutching at him and he fell the sharp edge of a rock loomed up and he knew no more chapter the loss it was night when taran came to his senses he found himself propped against a log a cloak wrapped around him his head throbbed his body ached eilonwy was bending over him anxiously taran blinked his eyes and tried to sit up for some moments his memory held only a mingling of sights and sounds of rushing water a stone a shout his head still whirled a yellow light shone in his eyes he realized as his mind gradually cleared that the girl had lit the golden sphere and had set it on the log beside him a small fire blazed crouched next to it the bard and gurgi fed twigs to the flames im glad you decided to wake up eilonwy said trying to appear cheerful as fflewddur and gurgi came to kneel beside taran you swallowed so much of the river we were afraid wed never be able to pump it out of you and that rap on your head didnt help matters the crochan taran gasped ellidyr he looked around him this fire he murmured we dare not show a light arawns warriors it was either build a fire or let you freeze to death said the bard so of course we decided on the first at this point he added with a wry grin i doubt it can make too much difference since the cauldron is out of our hands i dont believe arawn will have quite the same interest in us happily i might say where is the crochan taran asked despite his spinning head he raised himself from the log it is with ellidyr said eilonwy and if you ask where he is put in the bard we can answer you very quickly we do not know wicked prince goes off with wicked pot gurgi added yes yes with ridings and stridings good riddance to them agreed fflewddur i dont know which is worse the crochan or ellidyr now at least theyre both together you let him go taran cried in alarm he put his hands to his head you let him steal the crochan let is hardly the word my friend the bard answered ruefully you seem to have forgotten eilonwy added ellidyr was trying to kill you its a good thing you fell into the river because i can tell you the goingson werent very pleasant on the shore it was terrible as a matter of fact the girl went on wed all started after ellidyr by that time you were already floating down the river like a twig in a well like a twig in a river we tried to save you but ellidyr turned on us im certain he meant to kill us eilonwy said you should have seen his face and his eyes he was furious worse than that fflewddur tried to stand against him that villain has the strength of ten said the bard i could barely draw my sword its clumsy when you have a broken arm you understand but i faced him a dreadful clash of weapons youve never seen the prowess of an outraged fflam another moment and i should have had him at my mercy in a manner of speaking the bard added quickly he knocked me sprawling and gurgi fought too yes yes with smitings and bitings poor gurgi said eilonwy he did his best but ellidyr picked him up and tossed him against a tree when i tried to draw my bow he snatched it away and snapped it in his hands he chased us into the woods after that fflewddur said ive never seen a man in such a frenzy shouting at the top of his voice calling us robbers and oathbreakers and that we were trying to keep him in second place thats all hes able to say or think now if you choose to call that thinking taran shook his head sadly i fear the black beast has swallowed him up as adaon warned he said i pity ellidyr from the bottom of my heart i should pity him more muttered fflewddur if he hadnt tried to slice off my head for long i hated him taran said but in the little while i bore adaons brooch i believe i saw him more clearly his heart is unhappy and tormented nor shall i forget what he said to me that i taunted him for seeking glory yet clung to it myself taran spread his hands in front of him with dirty hands he said heavily pay no heed to what ellidyr says eilonwy cried after what he made us do he has no right to blame anyone for anything and yet taran said softly almost to himself he spoke the truth did he said eilonwy it was only too true for his own honor he would have slain us all we managed to escape from him fflewddur continued that is he finally stopped pursuing us when we came back the horses the crochan and ellidyr were gone after that we followed down the river looking for you you hadnt gone far but im still amazed that anyone can swallow so much water in such a short distance we must find him taran cried we dare not let him keep the crochan you should have left me and gone after him he tried to climb to his feet come now there is no time to lose fflewddur shook his head im afraid theres no use in it as our friend gwystyl might say theres not a sign of him anywhere we have no idea where he planned to go or what he had in mind to do he has too long a start on us and though i hate to admit it i dont believe any one of us or all of us together could do very much against him the bard glanced at his broken arm were hardly in the best way to deal with the crochan or ellidyr even if we found them taran stared silently into the fire you too speak the truth my friend he said with great gloom you have all done more than i could ever ask alas much better than i yes it would be useless now to seek ellidyr as useless as our quest has been we have forfeited all for nothing adaons brooch our honor and now the crochan itself we shall return to caer dallben emptyhanded perhaps ellidyr was right he murmured it is not fitting for a pigboy to seek the same honor as a prince pigboy eilonwy cried indignantly dont ever speak of yourself that way taran of caer dallben no matter what has happened youre not a pigboy youre an assistant pig keeper thats honor in itself not that they dont mean the same thing when you come right down to it she said but one is proud and the other isnt since you have a choice take the proud one taran said nothing for a time then raised his head to eilonwy adaon once told me there is more honor in a field well plowed than in a field steeped in blood as he spoke his heart seemed to lighten i see now that what he said was true above all i do not begrudge ellidyr his prize i too shall seek honor but i shall seek it where i know it will be found the companions passed the night in the forest and next morning turned southward across gentler land they saw neither huntsmen nor gwythaints and they made little attempt at concealment for as the bard had said the forces of arawn sought the crochan and not a pitiful band of stragglers unburdened they moved more easily though without lluagor and melynlas their pace on foot was slow and painful taran trudged silently his head bowed against the bitter wind dead leaves drove against his face but he paid them no heed filled as he was with the distress of his own thoughts some while after midday taran caught sight of movement among the trees covering a hill crest foreseeing danger he urged the companions to hurry across the open meadow and find cover in a thicket but before they could reach it a party of horsemen appeared at the rise and galloped toward them taran and the bard drew their swords gurgi nocked an arrow into his bowstring and the weary band made ready to defend themselves as best they could fflewddur suddenly gave a great shout and waved his sword excitedly put up your weapons he cried were safe at last these are morgants warriors they bear the colors of the house of madoc the warriors pounded closer taran too cried out with relief they were indeed king morgants riders and at their head rode king morgant himself as they reined up beside the companions taran hurried to morgants steed and dropped to one knee well met sire he cried we feared your men were servants of arawn king morgant swung down from the saddle his black cloak was torn and travelstained his face haggard and grim but his eyes still held the fierce pride of a hawk a trace of a smile flickered on his lips but you would have stood against us nonetheless he said raising taran to his feet what of prince gwydion of coll taran asked quickly and with sudden uneasiness we were separated at dark gate and have had no word of them adaon alas is slain and doli too i fear of the dwarf there has been no trace answered morgant lord gwydion and coll son of collfrewr are safe they seek you even now though morgant added with another half smile it has been my good fortune to find you the huntsmen of annuvin pressed us sharply at dark gate morgant went on at last we fought free of them and began to make our way toward caer cadarn where lord gwydion hoped you would join us we had not reached there said morgant before we had word of you and that you had taken it on yourselves to go to the marshes of morva that was a bold venture taran of caer dallben morgant added as bold perhaps as it was illadvised you should learn that a warrior owes obedience to his lord it did not seem we could do otherwise taran protested we had to find the crochan before arawn would you not have done the same morgant nodded curtly i do not reproach your spirit but would have you understand that lord gwydion himself would hesitate to make a decision of such weight we would have known nothing of your movements had not gwystyl of the fair folk brought us news lord gwydion and i separated then to search for you gwystyl eilonwy interrupted not gwystyl why he wouldnt have done the least thing for us until doli threatened to squeeze him gwystyl all he wanted was to be let alone and hide in his wretched burrow morgant turned to her you speak without knowledge princess among all who hold the way posts gwystyl of the fair folk is the shrewdest and bravest did you believe king eiddileg would trust a lesser servant so close to annuvin but he added if you misjudged him it was his intention that you do so as for the crochan itself morgant went on as taran looked at him in amazement though you failed to bring it from morva prince ellidyr has done us noble service yes morgant added quickly my warriors came upon him near the river tevvyn in the course of our search from his words i understood that you were drowned and your companions scattered and that he bore the cauldron from morva thats not true eilonwy began her eyes flashing angrily be silent taran cried no i will not be silent retorted eilonwy spinning around to face taran you arent going to tell me you still think youre bound by that oath you made us all swear what does she mean morgant asked his eyes narrowed and he studied taran closely ill tell you what i mean eilonwy answered heedless of tarans protest its very simple taran paid for it and paid dearly we carried it almost on our backs every step of the way from morva until ellidyr came along he helped us he certainly did that just the way a robber helps you tidy up your chamber thats the truth of it and i dont care what anybody else says does she indeed speak the truth morgant asked when taran did not answer morgant nodded slowly and continued in a thoughtful tone i believe she does though you stay silent there was much of prince ellidyrs tale which rang false to me as i once told you taran of caer dallben i am a warrior and i know my men but when you face ellidyr himself i shall know beyond all doubt come said morgant helping taran to his steed we shall ride to my camp your task is ended the crochan is in my hands morgants warriors took up the rest of the companions and they galloped swiftly into the wood the war lord had made camp in a wide clearing well protected by trees its approach guarded by a deep ravine and the tents had been blended in with a line of underbrush taran saw lluagor and melynlas tethered among the steeds of the warriors a little apart islimach pawed the ground nervously and pulled at her halter near the center of the clearing taran caught his breath at the sight of the black crochan which now had been removed from its sling though two of morgants warriors stood by it with drawn swords taran could not shake off the sense of fear and foreboding that hung like a dark mist about the cauldron do you not fear arawn will attack you here and gain the cauldron once again taran whispered morgants eyes hooded over and he gave taran a glance both of anger and pride whoever challenges me shall be met he said coldly be it the lord of annuvin himself a warrior drew aside the curtain of one of the pavilions and the war lord led them inside there bound hand and foot lay the still form of ellidyr his face was covered with blood and he appeared so grievously battered that eilonwy could not stifle a cry of pity how is this taran exclaimed turning to morgant in shock and reproach sire he added quickly your warriors had no right to use him so ill this is shameful and dishonorable treatment do you question my conduct morgant replied you have much to learn of obedience my warriors heed my orders and so shall you prince ellidyr dared to resist me i caution you not to follow his example at a call from morgant armed guards strode quickly into the tent the war leader made a brief gesture toward taran and his companions disarm them and bind them fast chapter the war lord before the startled taran could draw his blade a guard seized him and quickly lashed his arms behind his back the bard too was seized screaming and kicking eilonwy fought vainly for an instant gurgi broke loose from his captors and flung himself toward king morgant but a warrior struck him brutally to the ground leaped astride the limp figure and trussed him tightly traitor eilonwy shrieked liar you dare to steal silence her morgant said coldly and in another moment a gag muffled her cries frantically taran struggled to reach the girls side before he was thrown down and his legs secured with thongs morgant watched silently his features fixed and without expression the guards stepped away from the helpless companions morgant gestured for the warriors to leave the tent taran whose head still spun with confusion and disbelief strained against his bonds you are already a traitor he cried will you now be a murderer we are under the protection of gwydion you will not escape his wrath i do not fear gwydion answered morgant and his protection is worthless to you now worthless indeed to all prydain even gwydion is powerless against the cauldronborn taran stared at him in horror you would not dare to use the crochan against your own kinsmen your own people this is even more foul than treachery and murder do you believe so morgant replied then you have more lessons to learn than that of obedience the cauldron belongs to him who knows how to keep it and how to use it it is a weapon ready for a hand for years arawn was master of the cauldron yet he lost it is this not proof he was unworthy that he did not have the strength or cunning to prevent its slipping from his grasp ellidyr the proud fool believed he could keep it he is hardly fit to be cast into it what taran cried will you set yourself to rival arawn to rival him morgant asked with a hard smile no to surpass him i know my worth though i have chafed in the service of lesser men than i now i see the moment is ripe there are few he continued haughtily who understand the uses of power and few who dare use it when it is offered them power such as this was offered once to gwydion morgant went on he refused it i shall not fail to take it shall you i asked taran with a terrified glance at morgant king morgant nodded his eyes were hooded but his falcons face was keen and avid gwydion has spoken of you he said he told me little but that little is of interest you are a bold youth and perhaps more than that how much more i do not know but i do know you are without family without name or future you can expect nothing and yet morgant added you can expect everything i would not offer this to one such as ellidyr morgant continued he is too prideful weakest where he believes himself strong do you remember i told you that i know good mettle there is much that is possible with you taran of caer dallben and this is what i offer swear that you shall serve me as your liege lord and when the time is right you shall be my war leader second only to me in all prydain why do you offer me this taran cried why should you choose me as i have said morgant answered there is much you might achieve if the way is opened for you do not deny you have dreamed long of glory it is not impossible for you to find it if i judge you well judge me well taran flung back and you would know i scorn to serve an evil traitor i have no time to hear you vent your rage morgant said many plans must be made between now and dawn i shall leave you with this to consider will you be first among my warriors or first among my cauldronborn give me to the cauldron then taran shouted cast me in it now even as i live you have called me traitor morgant answered smiling do not call me fool i too know the secret of the cauldron do you think i would have the crochan shatter even before it began its work yes he went on i too have been to the marshes of morva long before the cauldron was taken from annuvin for i knew that sooner or later gwydion must make this move against arawn and so i prepared myself did you pay a price for the crochan i too paid a price for the knowledge of its workings i know how to destroy it and i know how to make it yield a harvest of power but you were bold nonetheless to hope to trick me morgant added you fear me he said drawing closer to taran and there are many in prydain who do yet you defy me to dare that there are few this is rare metal indeed ready to be tempered taran was about to speak but the war lord raised his hand say no more instead think carefully if you refuse you shall become a voiceless mindless slave without even hope of death to release you from your bondage tarans heart sank but he raised his head proudly if that is the destiny laid on me it will be a harder destiny than you believe morgant said his eyes flickering a warrior does not fear to give up his own life but will he sacrifice that of his comrades taran gasped with horror as morgant went on yes said the war lord one by one your companions shall be slain and given to the crochan who will it devour before you cry a halt will it be the bard or the shabby creature that serves you or the young princess they shall go before you even as you watch and at the last yourself weigh this carefully said the war lord i shall return for your answer he flung his black cloak about his shoulders and strode from the tent taran struggled against his bonds but they held firm he sank back and bowed his head the bard who had been silent this while heaved a sorrowful sigh in the marshes of morva he said if i had only known i should have asked orddu to change me into a toad at the time i didnt care for the idea as i think of it now its a happier life than being a cauldron warrior at least there would have been dew circles to dance in he will not succeed in this taran said somehow we must find a way to escape we dare not lose hope i agree absolutely fflewddur answered your general idea is excellent its only the details that are lacking lose hope by no means a fflam is always hopeful i intend to go on hoping he added ruefully even when they come and pop me into the crochan gurgi and ellidyr still lay unconscious but eilonwy had not ceased working furiously at the gag and now at last she succeeding in forcing it out of her mouth morgant she gasped hell pay for this why i thought id stifle he might have kept me from talking but he didnt keep me from listening when he comes back i hope he tries to put me in the cauldron first hell soon find out who hes dealing with hell wish hed never thought of making his own cauldronborn taran shook his head by then it will be too late we shall be slain before we are taken to the crochan no there is only one hope none of you shall be sacrificed because of me i have decided what i must do decided eilonwy burst out the only thing you have to decide is how we shall escape from this tent if youre thinking of anything else youre wasting your time thats like wondering whether to scratch your head when a boulders about to fall on it this is my decision taran said slowly i will accept what morgant offers what eilonwy exclaimed in disbelief for a while i thought youd actually learned something from adaons brooch how can you think to accept i shall swear my allegiance to morgant taran went on he shall have my word but shall not make me keep it an oath given under threat of death can not bind me this way at least we may gain a little time are you sure morgants warriors didnt strike you on the head and you didnt notice it eilonwy asked sharply do you imagine morgant wont guess what you plan he has no intention of keeping his part of the bargain hell slay us all anyway once youre in his clutches i mean more than you are you wont get out of them morgant might have been one of the greatest war leaders in prydain but hes turned evil and if you try coming to terms with him well youll find its worse than being a cauldron warrior though i admit that isnt very attractive either taran was silent for a time i fear you are right he said but i dont know what else we can do get out first eilonwy advised we can decide what else when the time comes somehow its hard to think about where to run as long as your hands and feet are tied up with much difficulty the tightly bound companions struggled closer and sought to undo each others thongs the knots refused to yield slipped from their numb fingers and only bit more deeply into their flesh again and again the companions returned to their labors until they lay breathless and exhausted even eilonwy no longer had the strength to speak they rested a while hoping to gain new energy but the night moved as a heavy tormented dream and the moments they passed in fitful drowsing did nothing to restore them nor did they dare lose too much precious time morning taran knew would come swiftly the cold gray trickle of dawn had already begun to seep into the tent all night as they had toiled taran had heard the movements of warriors in the clearing the voice of morgant crying harsh urgent commands now he dragged himself painfully to the curtain at the entrance of the tent pressed his cheek against the cold ground and tried to peer out he could see little for the rising mists swirled above the turf and he made out only shadow shapes hastening back and forth the warriors he imagined were gathering their gear perhaps making ready to strike camp a long pitiful whinny came from the line of tethered horses and he recognized it as that of islimach the crochan still squatted where it had been taran made out the dark brooding mass and it seemed to him in a flare of horror that its mouth gaped greedily taran rolled over and pulled himself back to the companions the bards features were pale he appeared half dazed by fatigue and suffering eilonwy raised her head and looked silently at him what murmured fflewddur has the moment already come for us to say farewell not yet taran said though morgant will be here soon enough i fear then our time will be upon us how does gurgi fare the poor thing is still unconscious eilonwy answered leave him as he is it is kinder thus ellidyr stirred and groaned feebly slowly his eyes opened he winced turned his bloodstained broken face to taran and studied him for a time as though without recognition then his torn lips moved in his familiar bitter grimace and so we are together again taran of caer dallben he said i did not expect us to meet so soon have no fear son of penllarcau taran answered it shall not be for long ellidyr bowed his head for that i am truly sorry i would make up the ill i have done all of you would you have said the same if the cauldron were still in your hands taran asked quietly ellidyr hesitated i shall speak the truth i do not know the black beast you saw is a harsh master its claws are sharp yet i did not feel them until now but i tell you this ellidyr continued trying to lift himself i stole the cauldron out of pride not evil i swear to you on whatever honor remains to me i would not have used it yes i would have taken your glory for my own but i too would have borne the crochan to gwydion and offered it for destruction believe this much of me taran nodded i believe you prince of penllarcau and now perhaps even more than you believe it yourself a wind had risen moaning through the trees and shaking the tent the curtain blew back taran saw the warriors forming in ranks behind the cauldron chapter the final price ellidyr taran cried have you strength enough to break your bonds and free the rest of us ellidyr rolled on his side and strained desperately against the tight cords the bard and taran tried to aid him but at last ellidyr fell back exhausted and gasping with the pain of his efforts too much of my strength is gone he murmured i fear morgant has given me my death wound i can do no more the curtain blew open again an instant later taran was flung full length and roughly spun around he kicked wildly with his bound legs and tried to right himself stop struggling you clot a voice shouted in his ear doli tarans heart leaped is it you clever question snapped the voice stop trying to fight me things are hard enough without your squirming whoever tied these knots i wish he had them about his neck taran felt firm hands drawing at the thongs doli how did you come here dont bother me with silly chatter growled the dwarf taran felt a knee jabbing into the small of his back as doli took a better grip on the bonds cant you see im busy muttered the dwarf no of course you cant but that doesnt matter drat if i hadnt lost my axe id be through this in no time oh my ears ive never stayed invisible so long at one go hornets wasps suddenly the thongs parted taran sat up and began as best he could to unbind his legs in another moment doli himself flashed into sight and set about freeing the bard the stout dwarf was grimy muddy and his ears were tinged bright blue doli stopped his exertions to clap his hands to his head enough invisibility is enough he cried no need for it here not yet bumblebees a whole hive of them in my ears how did you ever find us cried eilonwy as the dwarf ripped away her bonds if you must know the dwarf snapped impatiently i didnt find you not at first i found ellidyr saw him come up from the river a little before morgant reached him i was on my way to caer cadarn after i shook off the huntsmen to get help from gwydion i didnt dare waste time chasing through the marshes after you ellidyr had the cauldron and your horses too that got my suspicions up so i went invisible and followed him on foot as soon as i understood what had happened i turned back to look for you my pony had run off dratted beast we never liked each other and you got here ahead of me the dwarf knelt and untied gurgi who had begun to show some signs of life but hesitated when he came to ellidyr what about this one doli asked i have an idea hes better off as he is he added gruffly i know what he tried to do ellidyr raised his head taran met his glance and gestured quickly to doli free him taran ordered doli paused doubtful taran repeated his words the dwarf shook his head then shrugged if you say so he muttered setting to work on ellidyrs bonds while eilonwy chafed gurgis wrists the bard hurried to the tent flap and cautiously peered out taran searched vainly for weapons i can see morgant fflewddur called hes on his way here well he shall have a surprise we are unarmed taran cried they far outnumber us and can slay us at their pleasure rip up the back of the tent doli exclaimed make a run for it through the forest and leave the crochan in morgants hands replied taran no that we dare not do ellidyr had risen to his feet i had not strength enough to break my own bonds he said but i can still serve you before taran could stop him ellidyr plunged from the tent the guards shouted the alarm taran saw morgant fall back in astonishment then draw his sword slay him morgant commanded slay him keep him from the cauldron with the bard and doli at his heels taran raced from the tent and flung himself against king morgant fighting furiously to wrest the sword from the war lords hands with a savage snarl morgant caught him by the throat and tossed him to the ground then turned to pursue ellidyr the horsemen had broken ranks and hastened to close upon the running figure taran scrambled to his feet ahead he saw ellidyr grappling fiercely with one of the warriors fighting as he had never fought before the prince of penllarcau taran knew was calling on all the strength remaining to him ellidyr threw the warrior down but faltered and cried out as the mans sword thrust deep into his side clutching the wound ellidyr stumbled ahead no no taran shouted ellidyr save yourself a few paces from the cauldron struggling madly ellidyr broke free of the warriors then with a cry he flung himself into the crochans gaping mouth the crochan shuddered like a living thing in horror and dismay taran cried out again to ellidyr he fought his way toward the cauldron but in another instant a sharp clap louder than thunder rang above the clearing the leafless trees trembled to their roots the branches writhed as if in agony then while echoes ripped the air and a whirlwind screamed overhead the cauldron split and shattered the jagged shards fell away from the lifeless form of ellidyr a war horse burst from the thicket astride it rode king smoit a naked sword in his fist a shout of battle on his lips behind the redbearded king streamed mounted warriors who plunged against the men of morgant in the press of combat taran glimpsed a white steed galloping to the charge gwydion taran shouted and struggled to reach his side he caught sight of coll then the stout old warrior had drawn his sword and struck mightily about him gwystyl with kaw clinging to his shoulder dashed into the fray bellowing with rage king smoit drove straight for morgant who raised his sword and lashed viciously at the rearing steed smoit leaped to the ground two of morgants warriors threw themselves in front of him to defend their lord but smoit cut them down with powerful blows and strode past eyes unhooded and blazing his teeth bared morgant fought savagely amid the shattered pieces of the cauldron as though he sought defiantly to claim them his sword had broken under the force of smoits attack yet he slashed and thrust again and again with the jagged blade the grimace of hatred and arrogance frozen upon his features his hand still clutching the bloodstained weapon even as he fell morgants riders had been slain or captured as gwydions voice rose in command to cease the combat taran stumbled to ellidyrs side and tried to raise him he bowed his head in grief the black beast is gone from you prince of penllarcau he murmured a highpitched whinny behind him made taran turn it was islimach who had broken her tether and now stood over the body of her master the roan lifted her lean bony head tossed her mane spun about and galloped from the clearing taran understanding the frenzied look in the roans eyes cried out and ran after her islimach plunged through the undergrowth taran strove to overtake her and seize the hanging bridle but the roan sped onward to the ravine she did not check her speed even at the brink islimach made a mighty leap hung poised in the air a moment then plummeted to the rocks below taran covered his face with his hands and turned away in the clearing the bodies of king morgant and ellidyr lay side by side and the remainder of king smoits horsemen rode in a slow mournful circle around them alone and apart gwydion leaned heavily on the black sword dyrnwyn his shaggy head bent his weathered face filled with sorrow taran drew near and stood silently at length gwydion spoke fflewddur has told me all that befell you my heart is grieved that coll and i found you only now yet without king smoit and his warriors i fear we might not have prevailed he grew impatient and came seeking us had i been able to send him word i would have summoned him long before this i am grateful to him for his impatience and to you too assistant pigkeeper he added the crochan is destroyed and with it arawns power to add to the number of his cauldronborn it is one of the gravest defeats arawn has ever suffered but i know the price you paid it is ellidyr who paid the final price taran said slowly the last honor belongs to him he spoke then of islimach he has lost all else even his steed or perhaps gained all gwydion answered and his honor shall be certain we shall raise a barrow to his memory islimach too shall rest with him for they are both now at peace smoits dead shall also sleep in honor and a barrow be raised above morgant king of madoc morgant taran asked turning a puzzled glance to gwydion how can there be honor for such a man it is easy to judge evil unmixed replied gwydion but alas in most of us good and bad are closely woven as the threads on a loom greater wisdom than mine is needed for the judging king morgant served the sons of don long and well he went on until the thirst for power parched his throat he was a fearless and noble lord in battle he saved my life more than once these things are part of him and can not be put aside or forgotten and so shall i honor morgant gwydion said for what he used to be and ellidyr prince of penllarcau for what he became near the tents of morgant taran found the companions again under eilonwys care gurgi had recovered from the guards blow and looked only a little shaken poor tender head is filled with breakings and achings gurgi said with a wan smile at taran he is sad not to fight at side of kindly master he would have struck down wicked warriors oh yes theres been more than enough fighting eilonwy said i found your sword again she added handing the weapon to taran but sometimes i wish dallben hadnt given it to you in the first place its bound to lead to trouble oh i should think our troubles are over put in fflewddur cradling his injured arm the beastly old kettle is smashed to bits thanks to ellidyr he went on sadly the bards shall sing of our deeds and of his i dont care about that grumbled doli rubbing his ears which had only now begun to return to their natural color i just dont want anyone not even gwydion dreaming up another scheme to have me turn invisible good old doli taran said the more you grumble the more pleased you are with yourself good old doli replied the dwarf humph taran caught sight of coll and king smoit resting beneath an oak coll had taken off his closefitting helmet and though bruised and slashed his face beamed and his bald head glowed with pleasure as he put an arm around tarans shoulders we did not meet as soon as i expected coll said with a wink for i hear you were busy with other things my body and blood roared smoit giving taran a clap on the back you looked like a skinned rabbit last time i saw you now the rabbit is gone and only the skin and bones are left a loud squawk interrupted the redbearded king in surprise taran turned and saw gwystyl sitting alone and morose on his shoulder kaw hopped up and down and bobbed his head in delight so its you again gwystyl remarked sighing heavily as taran hurried over well you shant blame me for whats happened i warned you however whats done is done and theres no sense complaining no use in it at all you shall not deceive me again gwystyl of the fair folk taran said i know who you are and the valiant service you have rendered kaw croaked joyfully as taran smoothed his feathers and scratched him under the beak go on gwystyl said put him on your shoulder thats what he wants for the matter of that you shall have him as a gift with the thanks of the fair folk for you have done us a service too we were uneasy with the crochan knocking about here and there one never knew what would happen yes yes pick him up gwystyl added with a melancholy sigh hes taken quite a fancy to you its just as well im simply not up to keeping crows any more not up to it at all taran croaked kaw though i warn you again gwystyl went on pay no attention to him most of the time he talks just to hear himself talk like some others i could mention the secret is dont listen no use in it no use whatever after they had raised the barrows gwystyl left to resume his guard at the way post the companions king smoit and his riders departed from the clearing and turned their horses toward the river avren high overhead their wings darkening the sky flight after flight of gwythaints retreated toward annuvin of the huntsmen there was no sign and gwydion believed that arawn learning of the crochans destruction had summoned them to return the companions rode not in triumphant joy but slowly and thoughtfully the heart of king smoit too was heavy for he had suffered the loss of many warriors with kaw perched on his shoulder taran rode beside gwydion at the head of the column as it wound through hills rich with autumns colors for a long while taran did not speak it is strange he said at last i had longed to enter the world of men now i see it filled with sorrow with cruelty and treachery with those who would destroy all around them yet enter it you must gwydion answered for it is a destiny laid on each of us true you have seen these things but there are equal parts of love and joy think of adaon and believe this think too of your companions out of friendship for you they would have given up all they valued indeed all they possessed taran nodded i see now the price i paid was the least of all for the brooch was never truly mine i wore it but it was no part of me i am thankful i kept it as long as i did at least i knew for a little while how a bard must feel and what it must be like to be a hero that is why your sacrifice was all the more difficult gwydion said you chose to be a hero not through enchantment but through your own manhood and since you have chosen for good or ill you must take the risks of a man you may win or you may lose time will decide they had come into the valley of ystrad and here gwydion reined up the goldenmaned steed melyngar and i must now return to caer dathyl he said and bring word to king math you shall tell dallben all that has happened indeed this time you know more of these events than i go swiftly gwydion said reaching out his hand your comrades wait for you and coll i know is eager to ready his vegetable garden for winter farewell taran assistant pigkeeper and friend gwydion waved once and rode northward taran watched until he was out of sight he turned melynlas then and saw the faces of the companions smiling at him hurry along eilonwy called hen wen will be wanting her bath and im afraid gurgi and i left in such a hurry i didnt take time to straighten up the scullery thats worse than starting a journey and forgetting to put on your shoes taran galloped toward them
