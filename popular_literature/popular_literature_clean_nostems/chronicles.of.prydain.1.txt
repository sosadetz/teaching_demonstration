the chronicles of prydain book one the book of three lloyd alexander for the children who listened the grownups who were patient and especially for ann durell authors note this chronicle of the land of prydain is not a retelling or retranslation of welsh mythology prydain is not wales not entirely at least the inspiration for it comes from that magnificent land and its legends but essentially prydain is a country existing only in the imagination a few of its inhabitants are drawn from the ancient tales gwydion for example is a real legendary figure arawn the dread lord of annuvin comes from the mabinogion the classic collection of welsh legends though in prydain he is considerably more villainous and there is an authentic mythological basis for arawns cauldron hen wen the oracular pig the old enchanter dallben and others however taran the assistant pigkeeper like eilonwy of the red gold hair was born in my own prydain the geography of prydain is peculiar to itself any resemblance between it and wales is perhaps not coincidental but not to be used as a guide for tourists it is a small land yet it has room enough for gallantry and humor and even an assistant pigkeeper there may cherish certain dreams the chronicle of prydain is a fantasy such things never happen in real life or do they most of us are called on to perform tasks far beyond what we believe we can do our capabilities seldom match our aspirations and we are often woefully unprepared to this extent we are all assistant pigkeepers at heart la chapter the assistant pigkeeper taran wanted to make a sword but coll charged with the practical side of his education decided on horseshoes and so it had been horseshoes all morning long tarans arms ached soot blackened his face at last he dropped the hammer and turned to coll who was watching him critically why taran cried why must it be horseshoes as if we had any horses coll was stout and round and his great bald head glowed bright pink lucky for the horses was all he said glancing at tarans handiwork i could do better at making a sword taran protested i know i could and before coll could answer he snatched the tongs flung a strip of redhot iron to the anvil and began hammering away as fast as he could wait wait cried coll that is not the way to go after it heedless of coll unable even to hear him above the din taran pounded harder than ever sparks sprayed the air but the more he pounded the more the metal twisted and buckled until finally the iron sprang from the tongs and fell to the ground taran stared in dismay with the tongs he picked up the bent iron and examined it not quite the blade for a hero coll remarked its ruined taran glumly agreed it looks like a sick snake he added ruefully as i tried telling you said coll you had it all wrong you must hold the tongs so when you strike the strength must flow from your shoulder and your wrist be loose you can hear it when you do it right there is a kind of music in it besides he added this is not the metal for weapons coll returned the crooked halfformed blade to the furnace where it lost its shape entirely i wish i might have my own sword taran sighed and you would teach me swordfighting wisht cried coll why should you want to know that we have no battles at caer dallben we have no horses either objected taran but were making horseshoes get on with you said coll unmoved that is for practice and so would this be taran urged come teach me the swordfighting you must know the art colls shining head glowed even brighter a trace of a smile appeared on his face as though he were savoring something pleasant true he said quietly i have held a sword once or twice in my day teach me now pleaded taran he seized a poker and brandished it slashing at the air and dancing back and forth over the hardpacked earthen floor see he called i know most of it already hold your hand chuckled coll if you were to come against me like that with all your posing and bouncing i should have you chopped into bits by this time he hesitated a moment look you he said quickly at least you should know there is a right way and a wrong way to go about it he picked up another poker here now he ordered with a sooty wink stand like a man taran brought up his poker while coll shouted instructions they set to parrying and thrusting with much banging clanking and commotion for a moment taran was sure he had the better of coll but the old man spun away with amazing lightness of foot now it was taran who strove desperately to ward off colls blows abruptly coll stopped so did taran his poker poised in midair in the doorway of the forge stood the tall bent figure of dallben dallben master of caer dallben was three hundred and seventynine years old his beard covered so much of his face he seemed always to be peering over a gray cloud on the little farm while taran and coll saw to the plowing sowing weeding reaping and all the other tasks of husbandry dallben undertook the meditating an occupation so exhausting he could accomplish it only by lying down and closing his eyes he meditated an hour and a half following breakfast and again later in the day the clatter from the forge had roused him from his morning meditation his robe hung askew over his boney knees stop that nonsense directly said dallben i am surprised at you he added frowning at coll there is serious work to be done it wasnt coll taran interrupted it was i who asked to learn sword play i did not say i was surprised at you remarked dallben but perhaps i am after all i think you had best come with me taran followed the ancient man out of the forge across the chicken run and into the white thatched cottage there in dallbens chamber moldering tomes overflowed the sagging shelves and spilled onto the floor amid heaps of iron cook pots studded belts harps with or without strings and other oddments taran took his place on the wooden bench as he always did when dallben was in a mood for giving lessons or reprimands i fully understand said dallben settling himself behind his table in the use of weapons as in everything else there is a certain skill but wiser heads than yours will determine when you should learn it im sorry taran began i should not have i am not angry dallben said raising a hand only a little sad time flies quickly things always happen sooner than one expects and yet he murmured almost to himself it troubles me i fear the horned king may have some part in this the horned king asked taran we shall speak of him later said dallben he drew a ponderous leatherbound volume toward him the book of three from which he occasionally read to taran and which the boy believed held in its pages everything anyone could possibly want to know as i have explained to you before dallben went on and you have very likely forgotten prydain is a land of many cantrevs of small kingdoms and many kings and of course their war leaders who command the warriors but there is the high king above them all said taran math son of mathonwy his war leader is the mightiest hero in prydain you told me of him prince gwydion yes taran went on eagerly i know there are other things you do not know dallben said for the obvious reason that i have not told you for the moment i am less concerned with the realms of the living than with the land of the dead with annuvin taran shuddered at the word even dallben had spoken it in a whisper and with king arawn lord of annuvin dallben said know this he continued quickly annuvin is more than a land of death it is a treasure house not only of gold and jewels but of all things of advantage to men long ago the race of men owned these treasures by craft and deceit arawn stole them one by one for his own evil uses some few of the treasures have been wrested from him though most lie hidden deep in annuvin where arawn guards them jealously but arawn did not become ruler of prydain taran said you may be thankful he did not said dallben he would have ruled had it not been for the children of don the sons of the lady don and her consort belin king of the sun long ago they voyaged to prydain from the summer country and found the land rich and fair though the race of men had little for themselves the sons of don built their stronghold at caer dathyl far north in the eagle mountains from there they helped regain at least a portion of what arawn had stolen and stood as guardians against the lurking threat of annuvin i hate to think what would have happened if the sons of don hadnt come taran said it was a good destiny that brought them i am not always sure said dallben with a wry smile the men of prydain came to rely on the strength of the house of don as a child clings to its mother they do so even today math the high king is descended from the house of don so is prince gwydion but that is all by the way prydain has been at peace as much as men can be peaceful until now what you do not know dallben said is this it has reached my ears that a new and mighty warlord has risen as powerful as gwydion some say more powerful but he is a man of evil for whom death is a black joy he sports with death as you might sport with a dog who is he cried taran dallben shook his head no man knows his name nor has any man seen his face he wears an antlered mask and for this reason he is called the horned king his purposes i do not know i suspect the hand of arawn but in what manner i can not tell i tell you now for your own protection dallben added from what i saw this morning your head is full of nonsense about feats of arms whatever notions you may have i advise you to forget them immediately there is unknown danger abroad you are barely on the threshold of manhood and i have a certain responsibility to see that you reach it preferably with a whole skin so you are not to leave caer dallben under any circumstances not even past the orchard and certainly not into the forest not for the time being for the time being taran burst out i think it will always be for the time being and it will be vegetables and horseshoes all my life tut said dallben there are worse things do you set yourself to be a glorious hero do you believe it is all flashing swords and galloping about on horses as for being glorious what of prince gwydion cried taran yes i wish i might be like him i fear dallben said that is entirely out of the question but why taran sprang to his feet i know if i had the chance why dallben interrupted in some cases he said we learn more by looking for the answer to a question and not finding it than we do from learning the answer itself this is one of those cases i could tell you why but at the moment it would only be more confusing if you grow up with any kind of sense which you sometimes make me doubt you will very likely reach your own conclusions they will probably be wrong he added however since they will be yours you will feel a little more satisfied with them taran sank back and sat gloomy and silent on the bench dallben had already begun meditating again his chin gradually came to rest on his collarbone his beard floated around his ears like a fog bank and he began snoring peacefully the spring scent of apple blossom drifted through the open window beyond dallbens chamber taran glimpsed the pale green fringe of forest the fields ready to cultivate would soon turn golden with summer the book of three lay closed on the table taran had never been allowed to read the volume for himself now he was sure it held more than dallben chose to tell him in the sunfilled room with dallben still meditating and showing no sign of stopping taran rose and moved through the shimmering beams from the forest came the monotonous tick of a beetle his hands reached for the cover taran gasped in pain and snatched them away they smarted as if each of his fingers had been stung by hornets he jumped back stumbled against the bench and dropped to the floor where he put his fingers woefully into his mouth dallbens eyes blinked open he peered at taran and yawned slowly you had better see coll about a lotion for those hands he advised otherwise i shouldnt be surprised if they blistered fingers smarting the shamefaced taran hurried from the cottage and found coll near the vegetable garden you have been at the book of three coll said that is not hard to guess now you know better well that is one of the three foundations of learning see much study much suffer much he led taran to the stable where medicines for the livestock were kept and poured a concoction over tarans fingers what is the use of studying much when im to see nothing at all taran retorted i think there is a destiny laid on me that i am not to know anything interesting go anywhere interesting or do anything interesting im certainly not to be anything im not anything even at caer dallben very well said coll if that is all that troubles you i shall make you something from this moment you are taran assistant pigkeeper you shall help me take care of hen wen see her trough is full carry her water and give her a good scrubbing every other day thats what i do now taran said bitterly all the better said coll for it makes things that much easier if you want to be something with a name attached to it i cant think of anything closer to hand and it is not every lad who can be assistant keeper to an oracular pig indeed she is the only oracular pig in prydain and the most valuable valuable to dallben taran said she never tells me anything did you think she would replied coll with hen wen you must know how to ask here what was that coll shaded his eyes with his hand a black buzzing cloud streaked from the orchard and bore on so rapidly and passed so close to colls head that he had to leap out of the way the bees taran shouted theyre swarming it is not their time cried coll there is something amiss the cloud rose high toward the sun an instant later taran heard a loud clucking and squawking from the chicken run he turned to see the five hens and the rooster beating their wings before it occurred to him they were attempting to fly they too were aloft taran and coll raced to the chicken run too late to catch the fowls with the rooster leading the chickens flapped awkwardly through the air and disappeared over the brow of a hill from the stable the pair of oxen bellowed and rolled their eyes in terror dallbens head poked out of the window he looked irritated it has become absolutely impossible for any kind of meditation whatsoever he said with a severe glance at taran i have warned you once something frightened the animals taran protested first the bees then the chickens flew off dallbens face turned grave i have been given no knowledge of this he said to coll we must ask hen wen about it immediately and we shall need the letter sticks quickly help me find them coll moved hastily to the cottage door watch hen wen closely he ordered taran do not let her out of your sight coll disappeared inside the cottage to search for hen wens letter sticks the long rods of ash wood carved with spells taran was both frightened and excited dallben he knew would consult hen wen only on a matter of greatest urgency within tarans memory it had never happened before he hurried to the pen hen wen usually slept until noon then trotting daintily despite her size she would move to a shady comer of her enclosure and settle comfortably for the rest of the day the white pig was continually grunting and chuckling to herself and whenever she saw taran she would raise her wide cheeky face so that he could scratch under her chin but this time she paid no attention to him wheezing and whistling hen wen was digging furiously in the soft earth at the far side of the pen burrowing so rapidly she would soon be out taran shouted at her but the clods continued flying at a great rate he swung himself over the fence the oracular pig stopped and glanced around as taran approached the hole already sizable hen wen hurried to the opposite side of the pen and started a new excavation taran was strong and longlegged but to his dismay he saw that hen wen moved faster than he as soon as he chased her from the second hole she turned quickly on her short legs and made for the first both by now were big enough for her head and shoulders taran frantically began scraping earth back into the burrow hen wen dug faster than a badger her hind legs planted firmly her front legs plowing ahead taran despaired of stopping her he scrambled back over the rails and jumped to the spot where hen wen was about to emerge planning to seize her and hang on until dallben and coll arrived he underestimated hen wens speed and strength in an explosion of dirt and pebbles the pig burst from under the fence heaving taran into the air he landed with the wind knocked out of him hen wen raced across the field and into the woods taran followed ahead the forest rose up dark and threatening he took a breath and plunged after her chapter the mask of the king hen wen had had vanished ahead taran heard a thrashing among the leaves the pig he was sure was keeping out of sight in the bushes following the sound he ran forward after a time the ground rose sharply forcing him to clamber on hands and knees up a wooded slope at the crest the forest broke off before a meadow taran caught a glimpse of hen wen dashing into the waving grass once across the meadow she disappeared beyond a stand of trees taran hurried after her this was farther than he had ever dared venture but he struggled on through the heavy undergrowth soon a fairly wide trail opened allowing him to quicken his pace hen wen had either stopped running or had outdistanced him he heard nothing but his own footsteps he followed the trail for some while intending to use it as a landmark on the way back although it twisted and branched off so frequently he was not at all certain in which direction caer dallben lay in the meadow taran had been flushed and perspiring now he shivered in the silence of oaks and elms the woods here were not thick but shadows drenched the high tree trunks and the sun broke through only in jagged streaks a damp green scent filled the air no bird called no squirrel chattered the forest seemed to be holding its breath yet there was beneath the silence a groaning restlessness and a trembling among the leaves the branches twisted and grated against each other like broken teeth the path wavered under tarans feet and he felt desperately cold he flung his arms around himself and moved more quickly to shake off the chill he was he realized running aimlessly he could not keep his mind on the forks and turns of the path he halted suddenly hoofbeats thudded in front of him the forest shook as they grew louder in another moment a black horse burst into view taran fell back terrified astride the foamspattered animal rode a monstrous figure a crimson cloak flamed from his naked shoulders crimson stained his gigantic arms horror stricken taran saw not the head of a man but the antlered head of a stag the horned king taran flung himself against an oak to escape the flying hoofs and the heaving glistening flanks horse and rider swept by the mask was a human skull from it the great antlers rose in cruel curves the horned kings eyes blazed behind the gaping sockets of whitened bone many horsemen galloped in his train the horned king uttered the long cry of a wild beast and his riders took it up as they streamed after him one of them an ugly grinning warrior caught sight of taran he turned his mount and drew a sword taran sprang from the tree and plunged into the underbrush the blade followed hissing like an adder taran felt it sting across his back he ran blindly while saplings whipped his face and hidden rocks jutted out to pitch him forward and stab at his knees where the woods thinned taran clattered along a dry stream bed until exhausted he stumbled and held out his hands against the whirling ground the sun had already dipped westward when taran opened his eyes he was lying on a stretch of turf with a cloak thrown over him one shoulder smarted painfully a man knelt beside him nearby a white horse cropped the grass still dazed fearful the riders had overtaken him taran started up the man held out a flask drink he said your strength will return in a moment the stranger had the shaggy graystreaked hair of a wolf his eyes were deepset flecked with green sun and wind had leathered his broad face burnt it dark and grained it with fine lines his cloak was coarse and travelstained a wide belt with an intricately wrought buckle circled his waist drink the stranger said again while taran took the flask dubiously you look as though i were trying to poison you he smiled it is not thus that gwydion son of don deals with a wounded gwydion taran choked on the liquid and stumbled to his feet you are not gwydion he cried i know of him he is a great war leader a hero he is not his eyes fell on the long sword at the strangers belt the golden pommel was smooth and rounded its color deliberately muted ash leaves of pale gold entwined at the hilt and a pattern of leaves covered the scabbard it was truly the weapon of a prince taran dropped to one knee and bowed his head lord gwydion he said i did not intend insolence as gwydion helped him rise taran still stared in disbelief at the simple attire and the worn lined face from all dallben had told him of this glorious hero from all he had pictured to himself taran bit his lips gwydion caught tarans look of disappointment it is not the trappings that make the prince he said gently nor indeed the sword that makes the warrior come he ordered tell me your name and what happened to you and do not ask me to believe you got a sword wound picking gooseberries or poaching hares i saw the horned king taran burst out his men ride the forest one of them tried to kill me i saw the horned king himself it was horrible worse than dallben told me gwydions eyes narrowed who are you he demanded who are you to speak of dallben i am taran of caer dallben taran answered trying to appear bold but succeeding only in turning paler than a mushroom of caer dallben gwydion paused an instant and gave taran a strange glance what are you doing so far from there does dallben know you are in the forest is coll with you tarans jaw dropped and he looked so thunderstruck that gwydion threw back his head and burst into laughter you need not be so surprised gwydion said i know coll and dallben well and they are too wise to let you wander here alone have you run off then i warn you dallben is not one to be disobeyed it was hen wen taran protested i should have known i couldnt hold on to her now shes gone and its my fault im assistant pigkeeper gone gwydions face tightened where what has happened to her i dont know taran cried shes somewhere in the forest as he poured out an account of the mornings events gwydion listened intently i had not foreseen this gwydion murmured when taran had finished my mission fails if she is not found quickly he turned abruptly to taran yes he said i too seek hen wen you cried taran you came this far i need information she alone possesses gwydion said quickly i have journeyed a month from caer dathyl to get it i have been followed spied on hunted and now he added with a bitter laugh she has run off very well she will be found i must discover all she knows of the horned king gwydion hesitated i fear he himself searches for her even now it must be so he continued hen wen sensed him near caer dallben and fled in terror then we should stop him taran declared attack him strike him down give me a sword and i will stand with you gently gently chided gwydion i do not say my life is worth more than another mans but i prize it highly do you think a lone warrior and one assistant pigkeeper dare attack the horned king and his war band taran drew himself up i would not fear him no said gwydion then you are a fool he is the man most to be dreaded in all prydain will you hear something i learned during my journey something even dallben may not yet realize gwydion knelt on the turf do you know the craft of weaving thread by thread the pattern forms as he spoke he plucked at the long blades of grass knotting them to form a mesh that is cleverly done said taran watching gwydions rapidly moving fingers may i look at it there is a more serious weaving said gwydion slipping the net into his own jacket you have seen one thread of a pattern loomed in annuvin arawn does not long abandon annuvin gwydion continued but his hand reaches everywhere there are chieftains whose lust for power goads them like a sword point to certain of them arawn promises wealth and dominion playing on their greed as a bard plays on a harp arawns corruption burns every human feeling from their hearts and they become his liegemen serving him beyond the borders of annuvin and bound to him forever and the horned king gwydion nodded yes i know beyond question that he has sworn his allegiance to arawn he is arawns avowed champion once again the power of annuvin threatens prydain taran could only stare speechless gwydion turned to him when the time is ripe the horned king and i will meet and one of us will die that is my oath but his purpose is dark and unknown and i must learn it from hen wen she cant be far taran cried ill show you where she disappeared i think i can find the place it was just before the horned king gwydion gave him a hard smile do you have the eyes of an owl to find a trail at nightfall we sleep here and i shall be off at first light with good luck i may have her back before what of me taran interrupted hen wen is in my charge i let her escape and it is i who must find her the task counts more than the one who does it said gwydion i will not be hindered by an assistant pigkeeper who seems eager to bring himself to grief he stopped short and looked wryly at taran on second thought it appears i will if the horned king rides toward caer dallben i can not send you back alone and i dare not go with you and lose a days tracking you can not stay in this forest by yourself unless i find some way i swear i will not hinder you cried taran let me go with you dallben and coll will see i can do what i set out to do have i another choice asked gwydion it would seem taran of caer dallben we follow the same path for a little while at least the white horse trotted up and nuzzled gwydions hand melyngar reminds me it is time for food gwydion said he unpacked provisions from the saddlebags make no fire tonight he warned the horned kings outriders may be close at hand taran swallowed a hurried meal excitement robbed him of appetite and he was impatient for dawn his wound had stiffened so that he could not settle himself on the roots and pebbles it had never occurred to him until now that a hero would sleep on the ground gwydion watchful sat with his knees drawn up his back against an enormous elm in the lowering dusk taran could barely distinguish the man from the tree and could have walked within a pace of him before realizing he was any more than a splotch of shadow gwydion had sunk into the forest itself only his greenflecked eyes shone in the reflection of the newly risen moon gwydion was silent and thoughtful for a long while so you are taran of caer dallben he said at last his voice from the shadows was quiet but urgent how long have you been with dallben who are your kinsmen taran hunched against a tree root pulled his cloak closer about his shoulders i have always lived at caer dallben he said i dont think i have any kinsmen i dont know who my parents were dallben has never told me i suppose he added turning his face away i dont even know who i am in a way answered gwydion that is something we must all discover for ourselves our meeting was fortunate he went on thanks to you i know a little more than i did and you have spared me a wasted journey to caer dallben it makes me wonder gwydion went on with a laugh that was not unkind is there a destiny laid on me that an assistant pigkeeper should help me in my quest he hesitated or he mused is it perhaps the other way around what do you mean taran asked i am not sure said gwydion it makes no difference sleep now for we rise early tomorrow chapter gurgi by the time taran woke gwydion had already saddled melyngar the cloak taran had slept in was damp with dew every joint ached from his night on the hard ground with gwydions urging taran stumbled toward the horse a white blur in the graypink dawn gwydion hauled taran into the saddle behind him spoke a quiet command and the white steed moved quickly into the rising mist gwydion was seeking the spot where taran had last seen hen wen but long before they had reached it he reined up melyngar and dismounted as taran watched gwydion knelt and sighted along the turf luck is with us he said i think we have struck her trail gwydion pointed to a faint circle of trampled grass here she slept and not too long ago he strode a few paces forward scanning every broken twig and blade of grass despite tarans disappointment at finding the lord gwydion dressed in a coarse jacket and mudspattered boots he followed the man with growing admiration nothing taran saw escaped gwydions eyes like a lean gray wolf he moved silently and easily a little way on gwydion stopped raised his shaggy head and narrowed his eyes toward a distant ridge the trail is not clear he said frowning i can only guess she might have gone down the slope with all the forest to run in taran queried how can we begin to search she might have gone anywhere in prydain not quite answered gwydion i may not know where she went but i can be sure where she did not go he pulled a hunting knife from his belt here i will show you gwydion knelt and quickly traced lines in the earth these are the eagle mountains he said with a touch of longing in his voice in my own land of the north here great avren flows see how it turns west before it reaches the sea we may have to cross it before our search ends and this is the river ystrad its valley leads north to caer dathyl but see here gwydion went on pointing to the left of the line he had drawn for the river ystrad here is mount dragon and the domain of arawn hen wen would shun this above all she was too long a captive in annuvin she would never venture near it was hen in annuvin taran asked with surprise but how long ago gwydion said hen wen lived among the race of men she belonged to a farmer who had no idea at all of her powers and so she might have spent her days as any ordinary pig but arawn knew her to be far from ordinary and of such value that he himself rode out of annuvin and seized her what dire things happened while she was prisoner of arawn it is better not to speak of them poor hen taran said it must have been terrible for her but how did she escape she did not escape said gwydion she was rescued a warrior went alone into the depths of annuvin and brought her back safely that was a brave deed taran cried i wish that i the bards of the north still sing of it gwydion said his name shall never be forgotten who was it taran demanded gwydion looked closely at him do you not know he asked dallben has neglected your education it was coll he said coll son of collfrewr coll taran cried not the same the same said gwydion but but taran stammered coll a hero but hes so bald gwydion laughed and shook his head assistant pigkeeper he said you have curious notions about heroes i have never known courage to be judged by the length of a mans hair or for the matter of that whether he has any hair at all crestfallen taran peered at gwydions map and said no more here continued gwydion not far from annuvin lies spiral castle this too hen wen would avoid at all cost it is the abode of queen achren she is as dangerous as arawn himself as evil as she is beautiful but there are secrets concerning achren which are better left untold i am sure gwydion went on hen wen will not go toward annuvin or spiral castle from what little i can see she has run straight ahead quickly now we shall try to pick up her trail gwydion turned melyngar toward the ridge as they reached the bottom of the slope taran heard the waters of great avren rushing like wind in a summer storm we must go again on foot gwydion said her tracks may show somewhere along here so we had best move slowly and carefully stay close behind me he ordered if you start dashing ahead and you seem to have that tendency you will trample out any signs she might have left taran obediently walked a few paces behind gwydion made no more sound than the shadow of a bird melyngar herself stepped quietly hardly a twig snapped under her hoofs try as he would taran could not go as silently the more careful he attempted to be the louder the leaves rattled and crackled wherever he put his foot there seemed to be a hole or spiteful branch to trip him up even melyngar turned and gave him a reproachful look taran grew so absorbed in not making noise that he soon lagged far behind gwydion on the slope taran believed he could make out something round and white he yearned to be the first to find hen wen and he turned aside clambered through the weeds to discover nothing more than a boulder disappointed taran hastened to catch up with gwydion overhead the branches rustled as he stopped and looked up something fell heavily to the ground behind him two hairy and powerful hands locked around his throat whatever had seized him made barking and snorting noises taran forced out a cry for help he struggled with his unseen opponent twisting flailing his legs and throwing himself from one side to the other suddenly he could breathe again a shape sailed over his head and crashed against a tree trunk taran dropped to the ground and began rubbing his neck gwydion stood beside him sprawled under the tree was the strangest creature taran had ever seen he could not be sure whether it was animal or human he decided it was both its hair was so matted and covered with leaves that it looked like an owls nest in need of housecleaning it had long skinny woolly arms and a pair of feet as flexible and grimy as its hands gwydion was watching the creature with a look of severity and annoyance so it is you he said i ordered you not to hinder me or anyone under my protection at this the creature set up a loud and piteous whining rolled his eyes and beat the ground with his palms it is only gurgi gwydion said he is always lurking about one place or another he is not half as ferocious as he looks not a quarter as fierce as he should like to be and more a nuisance than anything else somehow he manages to see most of what happens and he might be able to help us taran had just begun to catch his breath he was covered with gurgis shedding hair in addition to the distressing odor of a wet wolfhound o mighty prince the creature wailed gurgi is sorry and now he will be smacked on his poor tender head by the strong hands of this great lord with fearsome smackings yes yes that is always the way of it with poor gurgi but what honor to be smacked by the greatest of warriors i have no intention of smacking your poor tender head said gwydion but i may change my mind if you do not leave off that whining and sniveling yes powerful lord gurgi cried see how he obeys rapidly and instantly he began crawling about on hands and knees with great agility had gurgi owned a tail taran was sure he would have wagged it frantically then gurgi pleaded the two strengthful heroes will give gurgi something to eat oh joyous crunchings and munchings afterward said gwydion when you have answered our questions oh afterward cried gurgi poor gurgi can wait long long for his crunchings and munchings many years from now when the great princes revel in their halls what feastings they will remember hungry wretched gurgi waiting for them how long you wait for your crunchings and munchings gwydion said depends on how quickly you tell us what we want to know have you seen a white pig this morning a crafty look gleamed in gurgis closeset little eyes for the seeking of a piggy there are many great lords in the forest riding with frightening shouts they would not be cruel to starving gurgi oh no they would feed him they would have your head off your shoulders before you could think twice about it gwydion said did one of them wear an antlered mask yes yes gurgi cried the great horns you will save miserable gurgi from hurtful choppings he set up a long and dreadful howling i am losing patience with you warned gwydion where is the pig gurgi hears these mighty riders the creature went on oh yes with careful listenings from the trees gurgi is so quiet and clever and no one cares about him but he listens these great warriors say they have gone to a certain place but great fire turns them away they are not pleased and they still seek a piggy with outcries and horses gurgi said gwydion firmly where is the pig the piggy oh terrible hunger pinches gurgi can not remember was there a piggy gurgi is fainting and falling into the bushes his poor tender head is full of air from his empty belly taran could no longer control his impatience where is hen wen you silly hairy thing he burst out tell us straight off after the way you jumped on me you deserve to have your head smacked with a moan gurgi rolled over on his back and covered his face with his arms gwydion turned severely to taran had you followed my orders you would not have been jumped on leave him to me do not make him any more frightened than he is gwydion looked down at gurgi very well he asked calmly where is she oh fearful wrath gurgi snuffled a piggy has gone across the water with swimmings and splashings he sat upright and waved a woolly arm toward great avren if you are lying to me said gwydion i shall soon find out then i will surely come back with wrath crunchings and munchings now mighty prince asked gurgi in a high tiny whimper as i promised you said gwydion gurgi wants the smaller one for munchings said the creature with a beady glance at taran no you do not gwydion said he is an assistant pig keeper and he would disagree with you violently he unbuckled a saddlebag and pulled out a few strips of dried meat which he tossed to gurgi be off now remember i want no mischief from you gurgi snatched the food thrust it between his teeth and scuttled up a tree trunk leaping from tree to tree until he was out of sight what a disgusting beast said taran what a nasty vicious oh he is not bad at heart gwydion answered he would love to be wicked and terrifying though he can not quite manage it he feels so sorry for himself that it is hard not to be angry with him but there is no use in doing so was he telling the truth about hen wen asked taran i think he was gwydion said it is as i feared the horned king has ridden to caer dallben he burned it taran cried until now he had paid little mind to his home the thought of the white cottage in flames his memory of dallbens beard and the heroic colls bald head touched him all at once dallben and coll are in peril surely not said gwydion dallben is an old fox a beetle could not creep into caer dallben without his knowledge no i am certain the fire was something dallben arranged for unexpected visitors hen wen is the one in greatest peril our quest grows ever more urgent gwydion hastily continued the horned king knows she is missing he will pursue her then taran cried we must find her before he does assistant pigkeeper said gwydion that has been so far your only sensible suggestion chapter the gwythaints melyngar bore them swiftly through the fringe of trees lining great avrens sloping banks they dismounted and hurried on foot in the direction gurgi had indicated near a jagged rock gwydion halted and gave a cry of triumph in a patch of clay hen wens tracks showed as plainly as if they had been carved good for gurgi exclaimed gwydion i hope he enjoys his crunchings and munchings had i known he would guide us so well i would have given him an extra share yes she crossed here he went on and we shall do the same gwydion led melyngar forward the air had suddenly grown cold and heavy the restless avren ran gray slashed with white streaks clutching melyngars saddle horn taran stepped gingerly from the bank gwydion strode directly into the water taran thinking it easier to get wet a little at a time hung back as much as he could until melyngar lunged ahead carrying him with her his feet sought the river bottom he stumbled and splashed while icy waves swirled up to his neck the current grew stronger coiling like a gray serpent about tarans legs the bottom dropped away sharply taran lost his footing and found himself wildly dancing over nothing as the river seized him greedily melyngar began to swim her strong legs keeping her afloat and in motion but the current swung her around she collided with taran and forced him under the water let go the saddle gwydion shouted above the torrent swim clear of her water flooded tarans ears and nostrils with every gasp the river poured into his lungs gwydion struck out after him soon overtook him seized him by the hair and drew him toward the shallows he heaved the dripping coughing taran onto the bank melyngar reaching shore a little farther upstream trotted down to join them gwydion looked sharply at taran i told you to swim clear are all assistant pigkeepers deaf as well as stubborn i dont know how to swim taran cried his teeth chattering violently then why did you not say so before we started across gwydion asked angrily i was sure i could learn taran protested as soon as i came to do it if melyngar hadnt sat on me you must learn to answer for your own folly said gwydion as for melyngar she is wiser now than you can ever hope to become even should you live to be a man which seems more and more unlikely gwydion swung into the saddle and pulled up the soaked bedraggled taran melyngars hoofs clicked over the stones taran snuffling and shivering looked toward the waiting hills high against the blue three winged shapes wheeled and glided gwydion whose eyes were everywhere at once caught sight of them instantly gwythaints he cried and turned melyngar sharply to the right the abrupt change of direction and melyngars heaving burst of speed threw taran off balance his legs flew up and he landed flat on the pebblestrewn bank gwydion reined in melyngar immediately while taran struggled to his feet gwydion seized him like a sack of meal and hauled him to melyngars back the gwythaints which at a distance had seemed no more than dry leaves in the wind grew larger and larger as they plunged toward horse and riders downward they swooped their great black wings driving them ever faster melyngar clattered up the river bank the gwythaints screamed above at the line of trees gwydion thrust taran from the saddle and leaped down dragging him along gwydion dropped to the earth under an oak trees spreading branches the glittering wings beat against the foliage taran glimpsed curving beaks and talons merciless as daggers he cried out in terror and hid his face as the gwythaints veered off and swooped again the leaves rattled in their wake the creatures swung upward hung poised against the sky for an instant then climbed swiftly and sped westward whitefaced and trembling taran ventured to raise his head gwydion strode to the river bank and stood watching the gwythaints flight taran made his way to his companions side i had hoped this would not happen gwydion said his face was dark and grave thus far i have been able to avoid them taran said nothing he had clumsily fallen off melyngar at the moment when speed counted most at the oak he had behaved like a child he waited for gwydions reprimand but the warriors green eyes followed the dark specks sooner or later they would have found us gwydion said they are arawns spies and messengers the eyes of annuvin they are called no one stays long hidden from them we are lucky they were only scouting and not on a blood hunt he turned away as the gwythaints at last disappeared now they fly to their iron cages in annuvin he said arawn himself will have news of us before this day ends he will not be idle if only they hadnt seen us taran moaned there is no use regretting what has happened said gwydion as they set out again one way or another arawn would have learned of us i have no doubt he knew the moment i rode from caer dathyl the gwythaints are not his only servants i think they must be the worst said taran quickening his pace to keep up with gwydion far from it gwydion said the errand of the gwythaints is less to kill than to bring information for generations they have been trained in this arawn understands their language and they are in his power from the moment they leave the egg nevertheless they are creatures of flesh and blood and a sword can answer them there are others to whom a sword means nothing gwydion said among them the cauldronborn who serve arawn as warriors are they not men taran asked they were once replied gwydion they are the dead whose bodies arawn steals from their resting places in the long barrows it is said he steeps them in a cauldron to give them life again if it can be called life like death they are forever silent and their only thought is to bring others to the same bondage arawn keeps them as his guards in annuvin for their power wanes the longer and farther they be from their master yet from time to time arawn sends certain of them outside annuvin to perform his most ruthless tasks these cauldronborn are utterly without mercy or pity gwydion continued for arawn has worked still greater evil upon them he has destroyed their remembrance of themselves as living men they have no memory of tears or laughter of sorrow or loving kindness among all arawns deeds this is one of the cruelest after much searching gwydion discovered hen wens tracks once more they led over a barren field then to a shallow ravine here they stop he said frowning even on stony ground there should be some trace but i can see nothing slowly and painstakingly he quartered the land on either side of the ravine the weary and discouraged taran could barely force himself to put one foot in front of the other and was glad the dusk obliged gwydion to halt gwydion tethered melyngar in a thicket taran sank to the ground and rested his head in his hands she has disappeared too completely said gwydion bringing provisions from the saddlebag many things could have happened time is too short to ponder each one what can we do then taran asked fearfully is there no way to find her the surest search is not always the shortest said gwydion and we may need the help of other hands before it is done there is an ancient dweller in the foothills of eagle mountains his name is medwyn and it is said he understands the hearts and ways of every creature in prydain he if anyone should know where hen wen may be hiding if we could find him taran began you are right in saying if gwydion answered i have never seen him others have sought him and failed we should have only faint hope but that is better than none at all a wind had risen whispering among the black clusters of trees from a distance came the lonely baying of hounds gwydion sat upright tense as a bowstring is it the horned king cried taran has he followed us this closely gwydion shook his head no hounds bell like those save the pack of gwyn the hunter and so he mused gwyn too rides abroad another of arawns servants asked taran his voice betraying his anxiety gwyn owes allegiance to a lord unknown even to me gwydion answered and one perhaps greater than arawn gwyn the hunter rides alone with his dogs and where he rides slaughter follows he has foreknowledge of death and battle and watches from afar marking the fall of warriors above the cry of the pack rose the long clear notes of a hunting horn flung across the sky the sound pierced tarans breast like a cold blade of terror yet unlike the music itself the echoes from the hills sang less of fear than of grief fading they sighed that sunlight and birds bright mornings warm fires food and drink friendship and all good things had been lost beyond recovery gwydion laid a firm hand on tarans brow gwyns music is a warning gwydion said take it as a warning for whatever profit that knowledge may be but do not listen overmuch to the echoes others have done so and have wandered hopeless ever since a whinny from melyngar broke tarans sleep as gwydion rose and went to her taran glimpsed a shadow dart behind a bush he sat up quickly gwydions back was turned in the bright moonlight the shadow moved again choking back his fear taran leaped to his feet and plunged into the undergrowth thorns tore at him he landed on something that grappled frantically he lashed out seized what felt like someones head and an unmistakable odor of wet wolfhound assailed his nose gurgi taran cried furiously you sneaking the creature curled into an awkward ball as taran began shaking him enough enough gwydion called do not frighten the wits out of the poor thing save your own life next time taran retorted angrily to gwydion while gurgi began howling at the top of his voice i should have known a great war leader needs no help from an assistant pigkeeper unlike assistant pigkeepers gwydion said gently i scorn the help of no man and you should know better than to jump into thorn bushes without first making sure what you will find save your anger for a better purpose he hesitated and looked carefully at taran why i believe you did think my life was in danger if i had known it was only that stupid silly gurgi the fact is you did not gwydion said so i shall take the intention for the deed you may be many other things taran of caer dallben but i see you are no coward i offer you my thanks he added bowing deeply and what of poor gurgi howled the creature no thanks for him oh no only smackings by great lords not even a small munching for helping find a piggy we didnt find any piggy taran replied angrily and if you ask me you know too much about the horned king i wouldnt be surprised if youd gone and told him no no the lord of the great horns pursues wise miserable gurgi with leaping and galloping gurgi fears terrible smackings and whackings he follows kindly and mighty protectors faithful gurgi will not leave them never and what of the horned king gwydion asked quickly oh very angry whined gurgi wicked lords ride with mumblings and grumblings because they can not find a piggy where are they now asked gwydion not far they cross water but only clever unthanked gurgi knows where and they light fires with fearsome blazings can you lead us to them gwydion asked i would learn their plans gurgi whimpered questioningly crunchings and munchings i knew he would get around to that said taran gwydion saddled melyngar and clinging to the shadows they set out across the moonlit hills gurgi led the way loping ahead bent forward his long arms dangling they crossed one deep valley then another before gurgi halted on a ridge below the wide plain blazed with torches and taran saw a great ring of flames crunchings and munchings now gurgi suggested disregarding him gwydion motioned for them all to descend the slope there was little need for silence a deep hollow drumming throbbed over the crowded plain horses whickered there came the shouts of men and the clank of weapons gwydion crouched in the bracken watching intently around the fiery circle warriors on high stilts beat upraised swords against their shields what are those men taran whispered and the wicker baskets hanging from the posts they are the proud walkers gwydion answered in a dance of battle an ancient rite of war from the days when men were no more than savages the baskets another ancient custom best forgotten but look there gwydion cried suddenly the horned king and there he exclaimed pointing to the columns of horsemen i see the banners of the cantrev rheged the banners of dau gleddyn and of mawr all the cantrevs of the south yes now i understand before gwydion could speak again the horned king bearing a torch rode to the wicker baskets and thrust the fire into them flames seized the osier cages billows of foul smoke rose skyward the warriors clashed their shields and shouted together with one voice from the baskets rose the agonized screams of men taran gasped and turned away we have seen enough gwydion ordered hurry let us be gone from here dawn had broken when gwydion halted at the edge of a barren field until now he had not spoken even gurgi had been silent his eyes round with terror this is a part of what i have journeyed so far to learn gwydion said his face was grim and pale arawn now dares try force of arms with the horned king as his war leader the horned king has raised a mighty host and they will march against us the sons of don are ill prepared for so powerful an enemy they must be warned i must return to caer dathyl immediately from a corner of woodland five mounted warriors cantered into the field taran sprang up the first horseman spurred his mount to a gallop melyngar whinnied shrilly the warriors drew their swords chapter the broken sword gurgi ran off yelping in terror gwydion was at tarans side as the first rider bore down on them with a quick gesture gwydion thrust a hand into his jacket and pulled out the net of grass suddenly the withered wisps grew larger longer shimmering and crackling nearly blinding taran with streaks of liquid flame the rider raised his sword with a shout gwydion hurled the dazzling mesh into the warriors face shrieking the rider dropped his sword and grappled the air he tumbled from his saddle while the mesh spread over his body and clung to him like an enormous spiderweb gwydion dragged the stupefied taran to an ash tree and from his belt drew the hunting knife which he thrust in tarans hand this is the only weapon i can spare he cried use it as well as you can his back to the tree gwydion faced the four remaining warriors the great sword swung a glittering arc the flashing blade sang above gwydions head the attackers drove against them one horse reared for taran there was only a vision of hoofs plunging at his face the rider chopped viciously at tarans head swung around and struck again blindly taran lashed out with the knife shouting in rage and pain the rider clutched his leg and wheeled his horse away there was no sign of gurgi but a white streak sped across the field melyngar now had entered the fray her golden mane tossing the white mare whinnied fearsomely and flung herself among the riders her mighty flanks dashed against them crowding pressing while the steeds of the war party rolled their eyes in panic one warrior jerked frantically at his reins to turn his mount away the animal sank to its haunches melyngar reared to her full height her forelegs churned the air and her sharp hoofs slashed at the rider who fell heavily to earth melyngar spun about trampling the cowering horseman the three mounted warriors forced their way past the frenzied mare at the ash tree gwydions blade rang and clashed among the leaves his legs were as though planted in the earth the shock of the galloping riders could not dislodge him his eyes shone with a terrible light hold your ground but a little while he called to taran the sword whistled one rider gave a choking cry the other two did not press the attack but hung back for a moment hoofbeats pounded over the meadow even as the attackers had begun to withdraw two more riders galloped forward they reined their horses sharply dismounted without hesitation and ran swiftly toward gwydion their faces were pallid their eyes like stones heavy bands of bronze circled their waists and from these belts hung the black thongs of whips knobs of bronze studded their breastplates they did not bear shield or helmet their mouths were frozen in the hideous grin of death gwydions sword flashed up once more fly he cried to taran these are the cauldronborn take melyngar and ride from here taran set himself more firmly against the ash tree and raised his knife in another instant the cauldronborn were upon them for taran the horror beating in him like black wings came not from the livid features of the cauldron warriors or their lightless eyes but from their ghostly silence the mute men swung their swords metal grated against metal the relentless warriors struck and struck again gwydions blade leaped past one opponents guard and drove deep into his heart the pale warrior made no outcry no blood followed as gwydion ripped the weapon free the cauldronborn shook himself once without a grimace and moved again to the attack gwydion stood as a wolf at bay his green eyes glittering his teeth bared the swords of the cauldronborn beat against his guard taran thrust at one of the livid warriors a sword point ripped his arm and sent the small knife hurtling into the bracken blood streaked gwydions face where an unlucky blow had slashed his cheekbone and forehead once his blade faltered and a cauldronborn thrust at his breast gwydion turned taking the sword point in his side the pale warriors doubled their assault the great shaggy head bowed wearily as gwydion stumbled forward with a mighty cry he lunged then dropped to one knee with his flagging strength he fought to raise the blade again the cauldronborn flung aside their weapons seized him threw him to the ground and quickly bound him now the other two warriors approached one grasped taran by the throat the other tied his hands behind him taran was dragged to melyngar and thrown across her back where he lay side by side with gwydion are you badly hurt asked gwydion striving to raise his head no taran said but your own wound is grave it is not the wound that pains me said gwydion with a bitter smile i have taken worse and lived why did you not flee as i ordered i knew i was powerless against the cauldronborn but i could have held the ground for you yet you fought well enough taran of caer dallben you are more than a war leader taran whispered why do you keep the truth from me i remember the net of grass you wove before we crossed avren but in your hands today it was no grass i have ever seen i am what i told you the wisp of grass yes it is a little more than that dallben himself taught me the use of it you too are an enchanter i have certain skills alas they are not great enough to defend myself against the powers of arawn today he added they were not enough to protect a brave companion one of the cauldronborn spurred his horse alongside melyngar snatching the whip from his belt he lashed brutally at the captives say no more gwydion whispered you will only bring yourself pain if we should not meet again farewell the party rode long without a halt fording the shallow river ystrad the cauldronborn pressed tightly on either side of the captives taran dared once again to speak to gwydion but the lash cut his words short tarans throat was parched waves of dizziness threatened to drown him he could not be sure how long they had ridden for he lapsed often into feverish dreams the sun was still high and he was dimly aware of a hill with a tall gray fortress looming at its crest melyngars hoofs rang on stones as a courtyard opened before him rough hands pulled him from melyngars back and drove him stumbling down an arching corridor gwydion was halfdragged halfcarried before him taran tried to catch up with his companion but the lash of the cauldronborn beat him to his knees a guard hauled him upright again and kicked him forward at length the captives were led into a spacious council chamber torches flickered from walls hung with scarlet tapestries outside it had been full daylight here in the great windowless hall the chill and dampness of night rose from the cold flagstones like mist at the far end of the hall on a throne carved of black wood sat a woman her long hair glittered silver in the torchlight her face was young and beautiful her pale skin seemed paler still above her crimson robe jeweled necklaces hung at her throat gemstudded bracelets circled her wrists and heavy rings threw back the flickering torches gwydions sword lay at her feet the woman rose quickly what shame to my household is this she cried at the warriors the wounds of these men are fresh and untended someone shall answer for this neglect she stopped in front of taran and this lad can barely keep his feet she clapped her hands bring food and wine and medicine for their injuries she turned again to taran poor boy she said with a pitying smile there has been grievous mischief done today she touched his wound with a soft pale hand at the pressure of her fingers a comforting warmth filled tarans aching body instead of pain a delicious sensation of repose came over him repose as he remembered it from days long forgotten in caer dallben the warm bed of his childhood drowsy summer afternoons how do you come here she asked quietly we crossed great avren taran began you see what had happened silence gwydions voice rang out she is achren she sets a trap for you taran gasped for an instant he could not believe such beauty concealed the evil of which he had been warned had gwydion mistaken her nevertheless he shut his lips tightly the woman in surprise turned to gwydion this is not courtesy to accuse me thus your wound excuses your conduct but there is no need for anger who are you why do you gwydions eyes flashed you know me as well as i know you achren he spat the name through his bleeding lips i have heard lord gwydion was traveling in my realm beyond that arawn sent his warriors to slay us cried gwydion and here they stand in your council hall do you say that you know nothing more arawn sent warriors to find not slay you answered achren or you would not be alive at this moment now that i see you face to face she said her eyes on gwydion i am glad such a man is not bleeding out his life in a ditch for there is much we have to discuss and much that you can profit from if you would treat with me said gwydion unbind me and return my sword you make demands achren asked gently perhaps you do not understand i offer you something you can not have even if i loosened your hands and gave back your weapon by that lord gwydion i mean your life in exchange for what i had thought to bargain with another life said achren glancing at taran but i see he is of no consequence alive or dead no she said there are other pleasanter ways to bargain you do not know me as well as you think gwydion there is no future for you beyond these gates here i can promise your promises reek of annuvin cried gwydion i scorn them it is no secret what you are achrens face turned livid hissing she struck at gwydion and her bloodred nails raked his cheek achren unsheathed gwydions sword holding it in both hands she drove the point toward his throat stopping only a hairs breadth from it gwydion stood proudly his eyes blazing no cried achren i will not slay you you shall come to wish i had and beg the mercy of a sword you scorn my promises this promise will be well kept achren raised the sword above her head and smote with all her force against a stone pillar sparks flashed the blade rang unbroken with a scream of rage she dashed the weapon to the ground the sword shone still undamaged achren seized it again gripping the sharp blade itself until her hands ran scarlet her eyes rolled back into her head her lips moved and twisted a thunderclap filled the hall a light burst like a crimson sun and the broken weapon fell in pieces to the ground so shall i break you achren shrieked she raised her hand to the cauldronborn and called out in a strange harsh language the pale warriors strode forward and dragged taran and gwydion from the hall in a dark passageway of stone taran struggled with his captors fighting to reach gwydions side one of the cauldronborn brought a whip handle down on tarans head chapter eilonwy taran came to his senses on a pile of dirty straw which smelled as though gurgi and all his ancestors had slept on it a few feet above him pale yellow sunlight shone through a grating the feeble beam ended abruptly on a wall of rough damp stone the shadows of bars lay across the tiny patch of light instead of brightening the cell the wan rays made it appear only more grim and closed in as tarans eyes grew accustomed to this yellow twilight he made out a heavy studded portal with a slot at the base the cell itself was not over three paces square his head ached since his hands were still bound behind him he could do no more than guess at the large and throbbing lump what had happened to gwydion he dared not imagine after the cauldron warrior had struck him taran had regained consciousness only a few moments before slipping once again into whirling darkness in that brief time he vaguely remembered opening his eyes and finding himself slung over a guards back his confused recollection included a dim corridor with doors on either side gwydion had called out to him once or so taran believed he could not recall his friends words perhaps even that had been part of the nightmare he supposed gwydion had been cast in another dungeon taran fervently hoped so he could not shake off the memory of achrens livid face and horrible screaming and he feared she might have ordered gwydion slain still there was good reason to hope his companion lived achren could easily have cut his throat as he braved her in the council hall yet she had held back thus she intended to keep gwydion alive perhaps taran thought wretchedly gwydion would be better off dead the idea of the proud figure lying a broken corpse filled taran with grief that quickly turned to rage he staggered to his feet lurched to the door kicking it battering himself against it with what little strength remained to him in despair he sank to the damp ground his head pressed against the unyielding oaken planks he rose again after a few moments and kicked at the walls if gwydion were by chance in an adjoining cell taran hoped he would hear this signal but he judged from the dull and muffled sound that the walls were too thick for his feeble tapping to penetrate as he turned away a flashing object fell through the grating and dropped to the stone floor taran stooped it was a ball of what seemed to be gold perplexed he looked upward from the grating a pair of intensely blue eyes looked back at him please said a girls voice light and musical my name is eilonwy and if you dont mind would you throw my bauble to me i dont want you to think im a baby playing with a silly bauble because im not but sometimes theres absolutely nothing else to do around here and it slipped out of my hands when i was tossing it little girl taran interrupted i dont but i am not a little girl eilonwy protested havent i just been and finished telling you are you slowwitted im so sorry for you its terrible to be dull and stupid whats your name she went on it makes me feel funny not knowing someones name wrongfooted you know or as if i had three thumbs on one hand if you see what i mean its clumsy i am taran of caer dallben taran said then wished he had not this he realized could be another trap thats lovely eilonwy said gaily im very glad to meet you i suppose youre a lord or a warrior or a war leader or a bard or a monster though we havent had any monsters for a long time i am none of those said taran feeling quite flattered that eilonwy should have taken him for any one of them what else is there i am an assistant pigkeeper taran said he bit his lip as soon as the words were out then to excuse his loose tongue told himself it could do no harm for the girl to know that much how fascinating eilonwy said youre the first weve ever had unless that poor fellow in the other dungeon is one too tell me of him taran said quickly is he alive i dont know said eilonwy i peeked through the grating but i couldnt tell he doesnt move at all but i should imagine he is alive otherwise achren would have fed him to the ravens now please if you dont mind its right at your feet i cant pick up your bauble taran said because my hands are tied the blue eyes looked surprised oh well that would account for it then i suppose i shall have to come in and get it you cant come in and get it said taran wearily dont you see im locked up here of course i do said eilonwy what would be the point of having someone in a dungeon if they werent locked up really taran of caer dallben you surprise me with some of your remarks i dont mean to hurt your feelings by asking but is assistant pigkeeper the kind of work that calls for a great deal of intelligence something beyond the grating and out of tarans vision swooped down and the blue eyes disappeared suddenly taran heard what he took to be a scuffle then a highpitched little shriek followed by a larger shriek and a moment or two of loud smacking the blue eyes did not reappear taran flung himself back on the straw after a time in the dreadful silence and loneliness of the tiny cell he began suddenly to wish eilonwy would come back she was the most confusing person he had ever met and surely as wicked as everyone else in the castle although he could not quite bring himself to believe it completely nevertheless he longed for the sound of another voice even eilonwys prattling the grating above his head darkened night poured into the cell in a black chilly wave the slot in the heavy portal rattled open taran heard something being slid into the cell and crawled toward it it was a shallow bowl he sniffed carefully and finally ventured to touch his tongue to it fearing all the while that it might be poisoned food it was not food at all but only a little water warm and musty his throat was so parched that taran disregarded the taste thrust his face into the bowl and drank it dry he curled up and tried to sleep away his pain the tight thongs pinched but his swollen hands were mercifully numb sleep brought only nightmares and he roused to find himself shouting aloud he settled down once more now there was a rasping sound under the straw taran stumbled to his feet the rasping grew louder move away cried a faint voice taran looked around him dumbfounded get off the stone he stepped backward the voice was coming from the straw well i cant lift it with you standing on it you silly assistant pigkeeper the muffled voice complained frightened and puzzled taran jumped to the wall the pallet began rising upward a loose flagstone was lifted pushed aside and a slender shadow emerged as if from the ground itself who are you taran shouted who did you expect said the voice of eilonwy and please dont make such a racket i told you i was coming back oh theres my bauble the shadow bent and picked up the luminous ball where are you cried taran i can see nothing is that whats bothering you eilonwy asked why didnt you say so in the first place instantly a bright light filled the cell it came from the golden sphere in the girls hand taran blinked with amazement whats that he cried its my bauble said eilonwy how many times do i have to tell you but but it lights up what did you think it would do turn into a bird and fly away eilonwy as the bewildered taran saw her for the first time had in addition to blue eyes long hair of reddish gold reaching to her waist her face though smudged was delicate elfin with high cheekbones her short white robe mudstained was girdled with silver links a crescent moon of silver hung from a fine chain around her neck she was one or two years younger than he but fully as tall eilonwy put the glowing sphere on the floor went quickly to taran and unknotted the thongs that bound him i meant to come back sooner eilonwy said but achren caught me talking to you she started to give me a whipping i bit her then she locked me in one of the chambers deep underground eilonwy went on pointing to the flagstones there are hundreds of them under spiral castle and all kinds of galleries and little passages like a honeycomb achren didnt build them this castle they say once belonged to a great king she thinks she knows all the passageways but she doesnt she hasnt been in half of them can you imagine achren going through a tunnel shes older than she looks you know eilonwy giggled but i know every one and most of them connect with each other it took me longer in the dark though because i didnt have my bauble you mean you live in this terrible place taran asked naturally eilonwy said you dont imagine id want to visit here do you is is achren your mother taran gasped and drew back fearfully certainly not cried the girl i am eilonwy daughter of angharad daughter of regat daughter of oh its such a bother going through all that my ancestors she said proudly are the sea people i am of the blood of llyr halfspeech the sea king achren is my aunt though sometimes i dont think shes really my aunt at all then what are you doing here i said i live here eilonwy answered it must take a lot of explaining before you understand anything my parents died and my kinsmen sent me here so achren could teach me to be an enchantress its a family tradition dont you see the boys are war leaders and the girls are enchantresses achren is leagued with arawn of annuvin cried taran she is an evil loathsome creature oh everybody knows that said eilonwy sometimes i wish my kinsmen had sent me to someone else but i think they must have forgotten about me by now she noticed the deep slash on his arm where did you get that she asked i dont think you know much about fighting if you let yourself get knocked about and cut up so badly but i dont imagine assistant pigkeepers are often called on to do that sort of thing the girl tore a strip from the hem of her robe and began binding tarans wound i didnt let myself be cut up taran said angrily thats arawns doing or your aunts i dont know which and i dont care one is no better than the other i hate achren eilonwy burst out she is a mean spiteful person of all the people who come here youre the only one whos the least bit agreeable to talk to and she had you damaged thats not the end of it taran said she means to kill my friend if she does that said eilonwy im sure shell include you achren doesnt do things by halves it would be a shame if you were killed i should be very sorry i know i wouldnt like it to happen to me eilonwy listen taran interrupted if there are tunnels and passages under the castle can you get to the other cells is there a way outside of course there is eilonwy said if theres a way in there has to be a way out doesnt there will you help us taran asked it is important for us to be free of this place will you show us the passage let you escape eilonwy giggled wouldnt achren be furious at that she tossed her head it would serve her right for whipping me and trying to lock me up yes yes she went on her eyes dancing thats a wonderful idea i would love to see her face when she comes down to find you yes that would be more fun than anything i could think of can you imagine listen carefully taran said is there a way you can take me to my companion eilonwy shook her head that would be very hard to do you see some of the galleries connect with the ones leading to the cells but when you try to go across what happens is that you start to run into passages that never mind then taran said can i join him in one of the passageways i dont see why you want to do that said the girl it would be so much simpler if i just go and let him out and have him wait for you beyond the castle i dont understand why you want to complicate things its bad enough for two people crawling about but with three you can imagine what that would be and you cant possibly find your way by yourself very well taran said impatiently free my companion first i only hope he is well enough to move if he isnt then you must come and tell me right away and ill think of some means of carrying him and there is a white horse melyngar taran went on i dont know whats been done with her she would be in the stable eilonwy said isnt that where youd usually find a horse please taran said you must get her too and weapons for us will you do that eilonwy nodded quickly yes that should be very exciting she giggled again she picked up the glowing ball cupped it in her hands and once again the cell was dark the stone grated shut and only eilonwys silvery laugh lingered behind taran paced back and forth for the first time he felt some hope though he wondered how much he could count on this scatterbrained girl she was likely to forget what she started out to do worse she might betray him to achren it might be another trap a new torment that promised him freedom only to snatch it away but even so taran decided they could be no worse off to save his energy he lay down on the straw and tried to relax his bandaged arm no longer pained him and while he was still hungry and thirsty the water he had drunk had taken some of the edge from his discomfort he had no idea how long it would take to travel through the underground galleries but as time passed he grew more anxious he worked at the flagstone the girl had used it would not move though tarans efforts bloodied his fingers he sank again into dark endless waiting eilonwy did not return chapter the trap from the corridor a faint sound grew louder taran hastened to press his ear against the slot in the portal he heard the heavy tread of marching feet the rattle of weapons he straightened and stood with his back to the wall the girl had betrayed him he cast about for some means to defend himself for he had determined they would not take him easily for the sake of having something in his hands taran picked up the dirty straw and held it ready to fling it was a pitiable defense and he wished desperately for gwydions power to set it ablaze the footsteps continued he feared then they would enter the other cell he breathed a sigh of relief when they did not stop but faded away toward what he imagined to be the far end of the corridor perhaps the guard was being changed he turned away certain eilonwy would not be back and furious with her and her false promises she was a rattlebrained fool who would undoubtedly giggle and take it as a great joke when the cauldronborn came for him he buried his face in his hands he could hear her chatter even now taran started up again the voice he heard was real must you always sit on the wrong stone it said youre too heavy to lift taran jumped up and hurriedly cleared the straw away the flagstone was raised the light from the golden ball was dim now but enough for him to see that eilonwy looked pleased with herself your companion is free she whispered and i took melyngar from the stable they are hidden in the woods outside the castle its all done now eilonwy said gleefully theyre waiting for you so if you get a move on and stop looking as if youd forgotten your own name we can go and meet them did you find weapons taran asked well no i didnt have a chance to look eilonwy said really she added you cant expect me to do everything can you eilonwy held the glowing sphere close to the stone floor go first she said then ill come down after so i can put the stone back in place then when achren sends to have you killed there wont be any trace at all shell think you disappeared into thin air and that will make it all the more vexing i know it isnt nice to vex people on purpose its like handing them a toad but this is much too good to miss and i may never have another chance at it achren will know you let us escape taran said no she wont said eilonwy because shell think im still locked up and if she doesnt know i can get out she cant know i was here but its very thoughtful of you to say that it shows a kind heart and i think thats so much more important than being clever while eilonwy continued to chatter away taran lowered himself into the narrow opening the passage was low he discovered and he was obliged to crouch almost on hands and knees eilonwy moved the stone into place and then began to lead the way the glow from the sphere showed walls of hard packed earth as taran hunched along other galleries opened up on either side be sure you follow me eilonwy called dont go into any of those some of them branch off and some of them dont go anywhere at all youd get lost and that would be a useless thing to do if youre trying to escape the girl moved so quickly taran had difficulty keeping up with her twice he stumbled over loose stones in the passage clutched at the ground and pitched forward the little light bobbed ahead while behind him long fingers of darkness grasped his heels he could understand why achrens fortress was called spiral castle the narrow stifling galleries turned endlessly he could not be sure whether they were making real progress or whether the tunnel was merely doubling back on itself the earthen ceiling trembled with racing footsteps were just below the guard room eilonwy whispered somethings happening up there achren doesnt usually turn out the guard in the middle of the night they must have gone to the cells taran said there was a lot of commotion just before you came they surely know were gone you must be a very important assistant pigkeeper said eilonwy with a small laugh achren wouldnt go to all that trouble unless hurry taran urged if she puts a guard around the castle well never get out i wish youd stop worrying eilonwy said you sound as if you were having your toes twisted achren can set out all the guards she wants she doesnt know where the mouth of the tunnel is and its hidden so well an owl couldnt see it after all you dont think id march you out the front gate do you despite her chattering eilonwy kept a rapid pace taran bent close to the ground moving half by touch keeping his eyes on the faint glow he skidded past sharp turns fetched up against rough walls skinned his knees then had to move twice as fast to regain the ground he had lost at another bend in the passageway eilonwys light wavered and dropped out of sight in the moment of darkness taran lost his footing as the ground rose steeply on one side he fell and rolled before he could recover his balance he was sliding rapidly downward in a shower of loose stones and earth he collided with an outcropping of rock rolled again and dropped suddenly into the darkness he landed heavily on flat stones legs twisted under him taran climbed painfully to his feet and shook his head to clear it suddenly he realized he was standing upright eilonwy and her light could not be seen he called as loudly as he dared after a few moments he heard a scraping above him and saw the faint reflection of the golden ball where are you called the girl her voice seemed quite distant oh i see part of the tunnels given way you must have slipped into a crevice its not a crevice taran called ive fallen all the way down into something and its deep cant you put the light into it ive got to get up again there were more scraping noises yes eilonwy said you have got yourself into a mess the grounds all broken through here and below theres a big stone like a shelf over your head how did you ever manage to do that i dont know how replied taran but i certainly didnt do it on purpose its strange eilonwy said this wasnt here when i came through the first time all that tramping must have jarred something loose its hard to say i dont think these tunnels are half as solid as they look and neither is the castle for the matter of that achrens always complaining about things leaking and doors not closing right do stop that prattling cried taran clasping his head i dont want to hear about leaks and doors show a light so i can climb out of here thats the trouble the girl said im not quite sure you can you see that shelf of stone juts out so far and goes down so steeply can you manage to reach it taran raised his arms and jumped as high as he could he could find no handhold from eilonwys description and from the massive shadow above he feared the girl was right he could not reach the stone and even if he could have its sharp downward pitch would have made it impossible to climb taran groaned with despair go on without me he said warn my companion the castle is alerted and what do you intend doing you cant just sit there like a fly in a jug that isnt going to help matters at all it doesnt make any difference about me taran said you can find a rope and come back when things are safe who knows when that will be if achren sees me theres no telling what might happen and suppose i couldnt get back youd turn into a skeleton while youre waiting i dont know how long it takes for people to turn into skeletons though i imagine it would need some time and youd be worse off than before what else am i to do cried taran eilonwys talk of skeletons made his blood run cold he recalled then the sound of gwyn the hunters horn and the memory of it filled him with grief and fear he bowed his head and turned his face to the rough wall thats very noble of you said eilonwy but i dont think its really necessary not yet at any rate if achrens warriors come out and start beating the woods i hardly think your friend would stay around waiting hed go and hide and find you later or so i should imagine that would be the sensible thing to do of course if hes an assistant pigkeeper too its hard to guess how his mind would work hes not an assistant pigkeeper taran said hes well its none of your business what he is thats not a very polite thing to say well nevertheless eilonwys voice dismissed the matter the main thing is to get you out theres nothing we can do taran said im caught here and locked up better than achren ever planned dont say that i could tear up my robe and plait it into a cord though ill tell you right away i wouldnt enjoy crawling around tunnels without any clothes on but i dont think it would be long enough or strong enough i suppose i could cut off my hair if i had a pair of shears and add it in no that still wouldnt do wont you please be quiet for a while and let me think wait im going to drop my bauble down to you here catch the golden sphere came hurtling over the ledge taran caught it in midair now then eilonwy called whats down there is it just a pit of some kind taran raised the ball above his head why its not a hole at all he cried its a kind of chamber theres a tunnel here too he took a few paces i cant see where it ends its big stones rattled behind him an instant later eilonwy dropped to the ground taran stared at her in disbelief you fool he shouted you addlepated what have you done now both of us are trapped and you talk about sense you havent eilonwy smiled at him and waited until he ran out of breath now she said if youve quite finished let me explain something very simple to you if theres a tunnel it has to go some place and wherever it goes theres a very good chance it will be better than where we are now i didnt mean to call you names taran said but he added sorrowfully there was no reason for you to put yourself in danger there you go again eilonwy said i promised to help you escape and thats what im doing i understand about tunnels and i shouldnt be surprised if this one followed the same direction as the one above it doesnt have half as many galleries coming off it and besides its a lot more comfortable eilonwy took the glowing sphere from tarans hand and stepped forward into the new passageway still doubtful taran followed chapter the barrow as eilonwy had said the passageway was more comfortable for they could walk side by side without crouching and scuttling like rabbits in a warren unlike those of the upper galleries the walls were lined with huge flat stones the ceiling was formed of even larger stones whose weight was supported by upright slabs set at intervals along the square corridor the air too smelled slightly better musty as if it had lain unstirred for ages but without the choking closeness of the tunnels none of this comforted taran greatly eilonwy herself admitted she had never explored the passage her blithe confidence did not convince him she had the slightest notion of where she was going nevertheless the girl hurried along her sandals tapping and echoing the golden light of the bauble casting its rays through shadows that hung like cobwebs they passed a few side galleries which eilonwy ignored well go straight to the end of this one she announced theres bound to be something there taran had begun wishing himself back in the chamber we shouldnt have come this far he said with a frown we should have stayed and found some way to climb out now you dont even know how long it will be before this passage stops we might go on tramping for days something else troubled him after all their progress it seemed the passageway should now follow an upward direction the tunnels supposed to bring us out about ground taran said but we havent stopped going down we arent coming out at all were only going deeper and deeper eilonwy paid no attention to his remarks but she was soon obliged to within another few paces the corridor stopped abruptly sealed by a wall of boulders that is what i feared cried taran dismayed we have gone to the end of your tunnel that you knew so much about and this is what we find now we can only go back were lost all our time and were no better off than when we started he turned away while the girl stood looking curiously at the barrier i cant understand said eilonwy why anyone would go to the trouble of building a tunnel and not have it go any place it must have been a terrible amount of work for whoever it was to dig it all and set in the rocks why do you suppose i dont know and i wish youd stop wondering about things that cant make any difference to us im going back taran said i dont know how im going to climb onto that shelf but i can certainly do it a lot more easily than digging through a wall well said eilonwy it is very strange and all im sure i dont know where we are i knew wed end up being lost i could have told you that i didnt say i was lost the girl protested i only said i didnt know where i was theres a big difference when youre lost you really dont know where you are when you just dont happen to know where you are at the moment thats something else i know im underneath spiral castle and thats quite good for a start youre splitting hairs taran said lost is lost youre worse than dallben who is dallben dallben is my oh never mind his face grim taran began retracing his steps eilonwy hurried to join him we could have a look into one of the side passageways she called taran disregarded the suggestion nevertheless approaching the next branching gallery he slowed his steps and peered briefly into the gloom go ahead eilonwy urged lets try this one it seems as good as any hush taran bent his head and listened intently from a distance came a faint whispering and rustling theres something well by all means lets find out what said eilonwy prodding taran in the back go ahead will you taran took a few cautious steps the passage here was lower and seemed to slope still further down with eilonwy beside him he continued gingerly setting each foot carefully remembering the sudden sickening fall that had brought him there in the first place the whispering became a high keening a wail of torment it was as though voices had been spun out like threads twisted taut ready to snap an icy current wove through the air carrying along with it hollow sighs and a swell of dull mutterings there were other sounds too raspings and shriekings like sword points dragged over stones taran felt his hands tremble he hesitated a moment and gestured for eilonwy to stay behind him give me the light he whispered and wait for me here do you think its ghosts eilonwy asked i dont have any beans to spit at them and thats about the only thing that will really do for a ghost but you know i dont think its ghosts at all ive never heard one though i suppose they could sound like that if they wanted to but i dont see why they should bother no i think its wind making all those noises wind how could there be wait taran said you may be right at that there might be an opening closing his ears to the horrifying sounds and preferring to think of them as draughts of air rather than spectral voices taran quickened his pace eilonwy paying no attention to his order to wait strode along with him they soon arrived at the end of the passage once more fallen stones blocked their way but this time there was a narrow jagged gap from it the wailing grew louder and taran felt a cold ribbon of air on his face he thrust the light into the opening but even the golden rays could not pierce the curtain of shadows taran slid cautiously past the barrier eilonwy followed they entered a lowceilinged chamber and as they did the light flickered under the weight of the darkness at first taran could make out only indistinct shapes touched with a feeble green glow the voices screamed in trembling rage despite the chill wind tarans forehead was clammy he raised the light and took another step forward the shapes grew clearer now he distinguished outlines of shields hanging from the walls and piles of swords and spears his foot struck something he bent to look and sprang back again stifling a cry it was the withered corpse of a man a warrior fully armed another lay beside him and another in a circle of ancient dead guarding a high stone slab on which a shadowy figure lay at full length eilonwy paid scant attention to the warriors having found something more interesting to her im sure achren hasnt any idea all this is here she whispered pointing to heaps of otterskin robes and great earthen jars overflowing with jewels weapons glistened amid stacks of helmets woven baskets held brooches collarpieces and chains shed have hauled it out long ago she loves jewelry you know though it doesnt become her one bit surely it is the barrow of the king who built this castle taran said in a hushed voice he stepped past the warriors and drew near the figure on the slab rich raiment clothed the body polished stones glowed in his broad belt the clawed hands still grasped the jeweled hilt of a sword as if ready to unsheath it taran recoiled in fear and horror the skull seemed to grimace in defiance daring a stranger to despoil the royal treasures as taran turned a gust of wind caught at his face i think there is a passage he called there in the far wall he ran in the direction of the ghostly cries close to the ground a tunnel opened he could smell fresh air and his lungs drank deeply hurry he urged taran snatched a sword from a warriors bony hand and scrambled into the tunnel the tunnel was the narrowest they had encountered flat on his belly taran squeezed and fought his way over the loose stones behind him he heard eilonwy gasping and struggling then a new sound began a distant booming and throbbing the earth shuddered as the pounding increased suddenly the passageway convulsed the hidden roots of trees sprang up the ground split beneath taran heaving and crumbling in another instant he was flung out at the bottom of a rocky slope a great crash resounded deep within the hill spiral castle high above him was bathed in blue fire a sudden gale nearly battered taran to the ground a tree of lightning crackled in the sky behind him eilonwy called for help she was half in half out of the narrow passage as taran wrestled with the fallen stones the walls of spiral castle shook like gray rags the towers lurched madly taran clawed away clumps of earth and roots im all tangled up with the sword eilonwy panted the scabbards caught on something taran heaved at the last rock what sword he said through gritted teeth he seized eilonwy under the arms and pulled her free oof she gasped i feel as if i had all my bones taken apart and put together wrong the sword you said you needed weapons didnt you and you took one so i thought i might as well too in a violent explosion that seemed ripped from the very center of the earth spiral castle crumbled in on itself the mighty stones of its walls split like twigs their jagged ends thrusting at the sky then a deep silence fell the wind was still the air oppressive thank you for saving my life said eilonwy for an assistant pigkeeper i must say you are quite courageous its wonderful when people surprise you that way i wonder what happened to achren she went on shell really be furious she added with a delighted laugh and probably blame everything on me for shes always punishing me for things i havent even thought of yet if achren is under those stones shell never punish anyone again taran said but i dont think wed better stay to find out he buckled on his sword the blade eilonwy had taken from the barrow was too long for the girl to wear comfortably at her waist so she had slung it from her shoulder taran looked at the weapon with surprise why thats the sword the king was holding naturally said eilonwy it should be the best one shouldnt it she picked up the glowing sphere were at the far side of the castle what used to be the castle your friend is down there among those trees assuming he waited for you id be surprised if he did with all this going on they ran toward the grove ahead taran saw the shadowy forms of a cloaked figure and a white horse there they are he cried gwydion he called gwydion the moon swung from behind the clouds the figure turned taran stopped short in the sudden brightness and his jaw dropped he had never seen this man before chapter fflewddur fflam tarans sword leaped out the man in the cloak hurriedly dropped melyngars bridle and darted behind a tree taran swung the blade pieces of bark sprayed the air while the stranger ducked back and forth taran slashed and thrust hacking wildly at bushes and branches youre not gwydion he shouted never claimed i was the stranger shouted back if you think im gwydion youre dreadfully mistaken come out of there taran ordered thrusting again certainly not while youre swinging that enormous here now watch that great belin i was safer in achrens dungeon come out now or you wont be able to taran shouted he redoubled his attack ripping furiously through the underbrush truce truce called the stranger you cant smite an unarmed man eilonwy who had been a few paces behind taran ran up and seized his arm stop it she cried thats no way to treat your friend after i went to all the bother of rescuing him taran shook off eilonwy what treachery is this he shouted you left my companion to die youve been with achren all along i should have known it youre no better than she is with a cry of anguish he raised his sword eilonwy ran sobbing into the woods taran dropped the blade and stood with bowed head the stranger ventured from behind the tree truce he inquired again believe me if id known it was going to cause all this trouble i wouldnt have listened to that redheaded girl taran did not raise his head the stranger took a few more cautious steps humblest apologies for disappointing you he said im awfully flattered you mistook me for prince gwydion theres hardly any resemblance except possibly a certain air of i do not know who you are taran said bitterly i do know that a brave man has bought your life for you i am fflewddur fflam son of godo the stranger said bowing deeply a bard of the harp at your service i have no need of bards taran said a harp will not bring my companion to life lord gwydion is dead fflewddur fflam asked those are sorrowful tidings he is a kinsman and i owe allegiance to the house of don but why do you blame his death on me if gwydion has bought my life at least tell me how and i shall mourn with you go your way said taran it is no fault of yours i trusted gwydions life to a traitor and liar my own life should be forfeit those are hard words to apply to a winsome lass said the bard especially one who isnt here to defend herself i want no explanation from her he said there is nothing she can tell me she can lose herself in the forest for all i care if shes as much of a traitor and a liar as you say fflewddur remarked then youre letting her off easily you may not want her explanation but im quite sure gwydion would allow me to suggest you go and find her before she strays too far taran nodded yes he said coldly gwydion shall have justice he turned on his heel and walked toward the trees eilonwy had gone no great distance he could see the glow of the sphere a few paces ahead where the girl sat on a boulder in a clearing she looked small and thin her head was pressed into her hands and her shoulders shook now youve made me cry she burst out as taran approached i hate crying it makes my nose feel like a melted icicle youve hurt my feelings you stupid assistant pigkeeper and all for something thats your own fault to begin with taran was so taken aback that he began to stammer yes cried eilonwy its every bit your fault you were so closemouthed about the man you wanted me to rescue and you kept talking about your friend in the other cell very well i rescued whoever it was in the other cell you didnt tell me there was anyone else in the dungeon there wasnt eilonwy insisted fflewddur fflam or whatever he calls himself was the only one then where is my companion taran demanded where is gwydion i dont know eilonwy said he wasnt in achrens dungeon thats sure whats more he never was taran realized the girl was speaking the truth as his memory returned he recalled that gwydion had been with him only briefly he had not seen the guards put him in a cell taran had only guessed at that what could she have done with him i havent any idea in the world eilonwy said and sniffed she could have brought him to her chambers or locked him in the tower theres a dozen places she could have hidden him all you needed to say was go and rescue a man named gwydion and i would have found him but no you had to be so clever about it and keep everything to yourself tarans heart sank i must go back to the castle and find him will you show me where achren might have imprisoned him theres nothing left of the castle said eilonwy besides im not sure im going to help you any more at all after the way youve behaved and calling me those horrid names thats like putting caterpillars in somebodys hair she tossed her head put her chin in the air and refused to look at him i accused you falsely taran said my shame is as deep as my sorrow eilonwy without lowering her chin gave him a sidelong glance i should think it would be i shall seek him alone said taran you are right in refusing to help it is no concern of yours he turned and started out of the clearing well you dont have to agree with me so quickly eilonwy cried she slid off the boulder and hastened after him fflewddur fflam was still waiting when they returned in the light of eilonwys sphere taran had a better view of this unexpected arrival the bard was tall and lanky with a long pointed nose his great shock of bright yellow hair burst out in all directions like a ragged sun his jacket and leggings were patched at knees and elbows and sewn with large clumsy stitches the work taran was certain of the bard himself a harp with a beautiful sweeping curve was slung from his shoulders but otherwise he looked nothing at all like the bards taran had learned about from the book of three so it seems that ive been rescued by mistake fflewddur said after taran explained what had happened i should have known it would turn out to be something like that i kept asking myself crawling along those beastly tunnels who could possibly be interested whether i was languishing in a dungeon or not i am going back to the castle taran said there may be hope that gwydion still lives by all means cried the bard his eyes lighting up a fflam to the rescue storm the castle carry it by assault batter down the gates theres not much of it left to storm said eilonwy oh said fflewddur with disappointment very well we shall do the best we can at the summit of the hill the mighty blocks of stone lay as if crushed by a giant fist only the square arch of the gate remained upright gaunt as a bone in the moonlight the ruins seemed already ancient shreds of mist hung over the shattered tower achren had learned of his escape taran guessed for at the moment of the castles destruction she had sent out a company of guards amid the rubble their bodies sprawled motionless as the stones with growing despair taran climbed over the ruins the foundations of the castle had collapsed the walls had fallen inward the bard and eilonwy helped taran try to shift one or two of the broken rocks but the work was beyond their strength at last the exhausted taran shook his head we can do no more he murmured this shall stand as gwydions burial mound he stood a moment looking silently over the desolation then turned away fflewddur suggested taking weapons from the bodies of the guards he equipped himself with a dagger sword and spear in addition to the blade she had taken from the barrow eilonwy carried a slim dagger at her waist taran collected as many bows and quivers of arrows as he could carry the group was now lightly but effectively armed with heavy hearts the little band made their way down the slope melyngar followed docilely her head bowed as if she understood that she would not see her master again i must leave this evil place taran cried i am impatient to be gone from here spiral castle has brought me only grief i have no wish to see it again what has it brought the rest of us eilonwy asked you make it sound as though we were just sitting around having a splendid time while you moan and take on taran stopped abruptly i im sorry he said i didnt mean it that way furthermore said eilonwy youre mistaken if you think im going to go marching through the woods in the middle of the night and i put in fflewddur i dont mind telling you im so tired i could sleep on achrens doorstep we all need rest taran said but i dont trust achren alive or dead and we still know nothing of the cauldronborn if they escaped they may be looking for us right now no matter how tired we are it would be foolhardy to stay this close eilonwy and fflewddur agreed to continue on for a little distance after a time they found a spot well protected by trees and flung themselves wearily to the turf taran unsaddled melyngar thankful the girl had thought to bring along gwydions gear he found a cloak in the saddlebag and handed it to eilonwy the bard wrapped himself in his own tattered garment and set his harp carefully on a gnarled root taran stood the first watch thoughts of the livid warriors still haunted him and he saw their faces in every shadow as the night wore on the passage of a forest creature or the restless sighing of wind in the leaves made him start the bushes rustled this time it was not the wind he heard a faint scratching and his hand flew to his sword a figure bounded into the moonlight and rolled up to taran crunchings and munchings whimpered a voice who is your peculiar friend asked the bard sitting up and looking curiously at this new arrival for an assistant pigkeeper remarked eilonwy you do keep strange company where did you find it and what is it ive never seen anything like that in my life he is no friend of mine cried taran he is a miserable sneaking wretch who deserted us as soon as we were attacked no no gurgi protested whimpering and bobbing his matted head poor humble gurgi is always faithful to mighty lords what joy to serve them even with shakings and breakings tell the truth said taran you ran off when we needed you most slashings and gashings are for noble lords not for poor weak gurgi oh fearsome whistlings of blades gurgi ran to look for help mighty lord you didnt succeed in finding any taran said angrily oh sadness gurgi moaned there was no help for brave warriors gurgi went far far with great squeakings and shriekings im sure you did taran said what else can unhappy gurgi do he is sorry to see great warriors in distress oh tears of misery but in battle what would there be for poor gurgi except hurtful guttings and cuttings of his throat it wasnt very brave said eilonwy but it wasnt altogether stupid either i dont see what advantage there was for him to be chopped up especially if he wasnt any help to you in the first place oh wisdom of a noble lady gurgi cried throwing himself at eilonwys feet if gurgi had not gone seeking help he would not be here to serve you now but he is here yes yes faithful gurgi returns to beatings and bruisings from the terrifying warrior just keep out of my sight taran said or you really will have something to complain about gurgi snuffled gurgi hastens to obey mighty lord he will say no more not even whisperings of what he saw no he will not disturb the sleepings of powerful heroes see how he leaves with tearful farewells come back here immediately taran called gurgi brightened crunchings listen to me taran said theres hardly enough to go round but ill give you a fair share of what we have after that youll have to find your own munchings gurgi nodded many more hosts march in the valley with sharp spears oh many more gurgi watches so quietly and cleverly he does not ask them for help no they would only give harmful hurtings whats this whats this cried fflewddur a great host i should love to see them i always enjoy processions and that sort of thing the enemies of the house of don are gathering taran hurriedly told the bard gwydion and i saw them before we were captured now if gurgi speaks the truth they have gathered reinforcements the bard sprang to his feet a fflam never shrinks from danger the mightier the foe the greater the glory we shall seek them out set upon them the bards shall sing our praises forever carried away by fflewddurs enthusiasm taran seized his sword then he shook his head remembering gwydions words in the forest near caer dallben no no he said slowly it would be folly to think of attacking them he smiled quickly at fflewddur the bards would sing of us he admitted but wed be in no position to appreciate it fflewddur sat down again disappointed you can talk about the bards singing your praises all you want said eilonwy im in no mood to do battle im going to sleep with that she curled up on the ground and pulled the cloak over her head still unconvinced fflewddur settled himself against a tree root for his turn at guard gurgi curled up at eilonwys feet exhausted though he was taran lay awake in his mind he saw again the horned king and heard the screams from the flaming cages he sat up quickly grieving for his companion he had forgotten what had brought him here his own quest had been for hen wen gwydions to warn the sons of don tarans head spun with his companion surely dead should he now try to make his way to caer dathyl what then would become of hen wen everything had ceased to be simple he yearned for the peacefulness of caer dallben yearned even to weed the vegetable gardens and make horseshoes he turned restlessly finding no answer at last his weariness overcame him and he slept plunged in nightmares chapter the sword dyrnwyn it was full daylight when taran opened his eyes gurgi was already sniffing hungrily at the saddlebag taran rose quickly and shared out as much of the remaining provisions as he dared keeping a small amount in reserve since he had no idea how difficult it would be to find food during the coming journey in the course of the restless night he had reached his decision though at present he refrained from speaking of it still unsure he had chosen wisely for the moment he concentrated on a meager breakfast gurgi sitting crosslegged devoured his food with so many outcries of pleasure and loud smackings of his lips that he seemed to be eating twice as much as he really did fflewddur bolted his scant portion as though he had not enjoyed a meal for at least five days eilonwy was more interested in the sword she had taken from the barrow it lay across her knees and with a perplexed frown the tip of her tongue between her lips the girl was studying the weapon curiously as taran drew near eilonwy snatched the sword away well said taran with a laugh you neednt act as if i were going to steal it from you although jewels studded the hilt and pommel the scabbard was battered discolored nearly black with age for all that it had an air of ancient lineage and taran was eager to hold it come he said let me see the blade i dare not cried eilonwy to tarans great surprise he saw that her face was solemn and almost fearful there is a symbol of power on the scabbard eilonwy continued ive seen this mark before on some of achrens things it always means something forbidden of course all achrens things are like that but some are more forbidden than others theres another inscription too said eilonwy frowning again but its in the old writing she stamped her foot oh i do wish achren had finished teaching it to me i can almost make it out but not quite and theres nothing more irritating its like not finishing what you started out to say fflewddur came up just then and he too peered at the strange weapon comes from a barrow eh the bard shook his spiky yellow head and whistled i suggest getting rid of it immediately never had much confidence in things you find in barrows its a bad business having anything to do with them you cant be sure where else theyve been and who alls had them if its an enchanted weapon taran began more interested than ever in getting his hands on the sword shouldnt we keep it oh do be quiet eilonwy cried i cant hear myself think i dont see what youre both talking about getting rid of it or not getting rid of it after all its mine isnt it i found it and carried it out and almost got stuck in a dirty old tunnel because of it bards are supposed to understand these things taran said naturally fflewddur answered smiling confidently and putting his long nose closer to the scabbard these inscriptions are all pretty much the same i see this ones on the scabbard rather than the blade it says oh something like beware my wrath the usual sentiments at that moment there was a loud twang fflewddur blinked one of his harp strings had snapped excuse me he said and went to see about his instrument it doesnt say anything at all like that eilonwy declared i can read some of it now here it starts near the hilt and goes winding around like ivy i was looking at it the wrong way it says dyrnwyn first i dont know whether thats the name of the sword or the name of the king oh yes thats the name of the sword here it is again draw dyrnwyn only thou of royal blood to rule to strike the something or other eilonwy went on its very faint i cant see it the letters are worn too smooth no thats odd they arent worn theyve been scratched out they must have been cut deeply because theres still a trace but i cant read the rest this word looks as if it might be death she shuddered thats not very cheerful let me unsheath it taran urged again there might be more on the blade certainly not said eilonwy i told you it had a symbol of power and im bound by it thats elementary achren can not bind you any longer it isnt achren eilonwy answered i only said she had things with the same mark this is a stronger enchantment than any she could make im quite sure i wouldnt dare to draw it and i dont intend letting you either besides it says only royal blood and doesnt mention a word about assistant pigkeepers how can you tell i havent royal blood taran asked bristling i wasnt born an assistant pigkeeper for all you know my father might have been a king it happens all the time in the book of three i never heard of the book of three said eilonwy but in the first place i dont think its good enough to be a kings son or even a king himself royal blood is just a way of translating in the old writing it didnt mean only having royal relatives anybody can have those it meant oh i dont know what youd call it something very special and it seems to me that if you have it you dont need to wonder whether you have it so of course said taran nettled by the girls remarks youve made up your mind that im not whatever it is i didnt mean to offend you eilonwy said quickly for an assistant pigkeeper i think youre quite remarkable i even think youre the nicest person ive ever met in my life its just that im forbidden to let you have the sword and thats that what will you do with it then keep it naturally im not going to drop it down a well am i taran snorted youll make a fine sight a little girl carrying a sword i am not a little girl said eilonwy tossing her hair in exasperation among my people in the olden days the swordmaidens did battle beside the men its not the olden days now taran said instead of a sword you should be carrying a doll eilonwy with a squeal of vexation raised a hand to slap at taran when fflewddur fflam returned here now said the bard no squabbling theres not a bit of use to it with a large key he tightened the wooden peg holding the newly repaired harp string eilonwy turned her irritation on fflewddur that inscription was a very important one it didnt say anything about bewaring anyones wrath you didnt read it right at all youre a fine bard if you cant make out the writing on an enchanted sword well you see the truth of the matter said fflewddur clearing his throat and speaking with much hesitation is this way im not officially a bard i didnt know there were unofficial bards eilonwy remarked oh yes indeed said fflewddur at least in my case im also a king a king taran said sire he dropped to one knee none of that none of that said fflewddur i dont bother with it any more where is your kingdom eilonwy asked several days journey east of caer dathyl said fflewddur it is a vast realm at this taran heard another jangling drat the thing said the bard there go two more strings as i was saying yes well it is actually a rather small kingdom in the north very dull and dreary so i gave it up id always loved barding and wandering and thats what i decided to do i thought bards had to study a great deal eilonwy said a person cant just go and decide yes that was one of the problems said the former king i studied i did quite well in the examinations a small string at the upper end of the harp broke with a highpitched tinkle and curled up like an ivy tendril i did quite poorly he went on and the council of bards wouldnt admit me really they want you to know so much these days volumes and volumes of poetry and chants and music and calculating the seasons and history and all kinds of alphabets you spell out on your fingers and secret signs a man couldnt hope to cram it all into his skull the council were very nice to me continued fflewddur taliesin the chief bard himself presented me with this harp he said it was exactly what i needed i sometimes wonder if he was really doing me a favor its a very nice harp but i have such trouble with the strings id throw it away and get another but it has a beautiful tone i should never find one as good if only the beastly strings they do seem to break frequently eilonwy began yes thats so fflewddur admitted a little sheepishly ive noticed it usually happens when well im an emotional sort of fellow and i do get carried away i might ah readjust the facts slightly purely for dramatic effect you understand if youd stop readjusting the facts quite as much eilonwy said perhaps you wouldnt have that trouble with the harp yes i suppose said the bard with a sigh i try but its hard very hard as a king you get into the habit sometimes i think i pass more time fixing strings than playing but there it is you cant have everything where were you journeying when achren captured you taran asked no place in particular said fflewddur thats one advantage you dont have to hurry to get somewhere you keep moving and next thing you know there you are unfortunately in this case it was achrens dungeon she didnt care for my playing that woman has no ear for music he added shuddering sire taran said i ask a boon please said the former king fflewddur will do very well a boon delighted i havent done any boongranting since i gave up my throne fflewddur fflam and eilonwy seated themselves on the turf while taran recounted his search for hen wen and what gwydion had told him of the horned king and the rising of the cantrevs gurgi having finished his meal sidled over and squatted on a hillock to listen there is no doubt in my mind taran went on the sons of don must have news of the uprising before the horned king strikes if he triumphs arawn will have prydain by the throat i have seen with my own eyes what that means he felt ill at ease speaking as if he himself were a war leader in a council hall but soon the words began to come easier perhaps he thought because he was speaking for gwydion i see your plan fflewddur interrupted you shall keep on looking for your pig and you want me to warn the warriors of don splendid i shall start off immediately and if the hosts of the horned king overtake me the bard slashed and thrust at the air they shall know the valor of a fflam taran shook his head no i shall journey to caer dathyl myself i do not question your valor he said to the bard but the danger is too great i ask no one else to face it in my stead when do you intend to seek your pig asked fflewddur my own quest said taran looking at the bard must be given up if it is possible after the first task is done i mean to return to it until then i serve only gwydion it was i who cost him his life and it is justice for me to do what i believe he would have done as i grasp the situation said the bard i think youre taking too much blame on yourself you had no way of knowing gwydion wasnt in the dungeon it changes nothing taran answered i have made my decision fflewddur was about to protest but the firmness of tarans words silenced the bard after a moment he asked what is your boon then it is twofold said taran first tell me how i may reach caer dathyl as quickly as possible second i beg you to conduct this girl safely to her own people before fflewddur could open his mouth eilonwy gave an indignant cry and leaped to her feet conducted i shall be conducted where i please im not going to be sent back just so i can be sent somewhere else and it will be another dreary place you can be sure no i shall go to caer dathyl too there is risk enough taran declared without having to worry about a girl eilonwy put her hands on her hips her eyes flashed i dont like being called a girl and this girl as if i didnt have a name at all its like having your head put in a sack if youve made your decision ive made my own i dont see how youre going to stop me if you she hurried on pointing at the bard try to conduct me to my mean stupid kinsmen and theyre hardly related to me in the first place that harp will be in pieces around your ears fflewddur blinked and clutched his harp protectively while eilonwy went on and if a certain assistant pigkeeper i wont even mention his name thinks otherwise hell be even more mistaken everyone started talking at once stop it cried taran at the top of his voice very well he said after the others grew quiet you he said to eilonwy could be tied up and set on melyngar but he added raising his hand before the girl could interrupt that will not be done not because of all the commotion you raised but because i realize now it is best the bard looked surprised taran continued there is greater safety in greater numbers whatever happens there will be more chance for one of us to reach caer dathyl i believe we should all stay together and faithful gurgi too shouted gurgi he will follow too many wicked enemies are smirking and lurking to jab him with pointy spears if he agrees taran said fflewddur shall act as guide but i warn you he added glancing at gurgi and eilonwy nothing must hinder our task ordinarily said fflewddur i prefer to be in charge of this type of expedition myself but he went on as taran was about to protest since you are acting for lord gwydion i accept your authority as i would accept his he bowed low a fflam is yours to command forward then the bard cried and if we must give battle so be it why ive carved my way through walls of spearmen six harp strings broke at once and the others strained so tautly they looked on the verge of snapping while taran saddled melyngar the bard set ruefully to work repairing his harp chapter flight through the hills at first taran offered to let eilonwy ride melyngar but the girl refused i can walk as well as any of you she cried so angrily that taran made no more of it he had learned to be wary of the girls sharp tongue it was agreed that the white mare would carry the weapons taken from spiral castle except the sword dyrnwyn of which eilonwy had appointed herself guardian scratching in the dirt with his dagger point fflewddur fflam showed taran the path he intended to follow the hosts of the horned king will surely stay in the valley of ystrad its the easiest way for an army on the march spiral castle was here he added with an angry jab to mark the spot west of the river ystrad now the shortest road would be straight north over these hills that is the one we must take said taran trying hard to make sense of fflewddurs crisscrossing lines wouldnt recommend it my friend we should be passing a little too near annuvin arawns strongholds are close to spiral castle and i suggest we keep clear of them no what i believe we should do is this stay on the high ground of the western bank of the ystrad we can go quite directly since we neednt follow the valley itself that way we can avoid both annuvin and the horned king the four of us can move faster than heavily armed warriors we shall come out well ahead of them not too far from caer dathyl from there we make a dash for it and our task is done fflewddur straightened up beaming with satisfaction there you have it he said wiping the dirt from his dagger a brilliant strategy my own war leader couldnt have arranged it better yes said taran his head still muddled with the bards talk of high ground and western banks that sounds very reasonable they descended to a broad sunswept meadow the morning had turned bright and warm dew still clung to bending blades of grass at the head of the travelers strode fflewddur stepping out briskly on his long spindly shanks the harp jogged on his back his shabby cloak was rolled over his shoulder eilonwy hair disheveled by the breeze the great black sword slung behind her followed next with gurgi immediately after so many new leaves and twigs had stuck in gurgis hair that he had begun to look like a walking beaver dam he loped along swinging his arms shaking his head from side to side moaning and muttering holding melyngars bridle taran marched last in line except for the weapons lashed to the horses saddle these travelers might have been on a spring ramble eilonwy chattered gaily now and then fflewddur burst into a snatch of song taran alone was uneasy to him the bright morning felt deceptively gentle the golden trees seemed to cover dark shadows he shuddered even in the warmth his heart was troubled too as he watched his companions in caer dallben he had dreamed of being a hero but dreaming he had come to learn was easy and at caer dallben no lives depended on his judgment he longed for gwydions strength and guidance his own strength he feared was not equal to his task he turned once for a last look in the direction of spiral castle gwydions burial mound over the hill crest stark against the clouds rose two figures on horseback taran shouted and gestured for his companions to take cover in the woods melyngar galloped forward in another moment they were all crouching in a thicket the horsemen followed along the crest too far away for taran to see their faces clearly but from their rigid postures he could guess at the livid features and dull eyes of the cauldronborn how long have they been behind us asked fflewddur have they seen us taran looked cautiously through the screen of leaves he pointed toward the slope there is your answer he said from the crest the pale cauldron warriors had turned their horses toward the meadow and were steadily picking their way down the hill hurry ordered taran we must outrun them the group did not return to the meadow but struck out across the woods the appearance of the cauldronborn now forced them to abandon the path fflewddur had chosen but the bard hoped they might throw the warriors off the track and circle back again to higher ground staying close to one another they moved at a dog trot not daring to stop even for water the forest offered a measure of protection from the sun but after a time the pace began to tell on them only gurgi did not seem fatigued or uncomfortable he loped steadily along and the swarms of midges and stinging insects could not penetrate his matted hair eilonwy who proudly insisted she enjoyed running clung to melyngars stirrup taran could not be sure how close the warriors were he knew the cauldronborn could hardly fail to track them by sound if nothing else for they no longer attempted to move silently speed was their only hope and long after nightfall they pressed on it had become a blind race into darkness under a moon drowned in heavy clouds invisible branches grasped at them or slashed their faces eilonwy stumbled once and taran pulled her to her feet the girl faltered again her head drooped taran unstrapped the weapons on melyngars saddle shared out the burden with fflewddur and gurgi and hoisted the protesting eilonwy to melyngars back she slumped forward her cheek pressed against the horses golden mane all night they struggled through the forest which grew denser the closer they approached the ystrad valley by the time the first hesitating light of day appeared even gurgi had begun to stumble with fatigue and could barely put one hairy foot in front of the other eilonwy had fallen into a slumber so deep that taran feared she was ill her hair lay bedraggled and damp upon her forehead her face was pallid with the bards help taran lifted her from the saddle and propped her against a mossy bank when he ventured to unbuckle the cumbersome sword eilonwy opened one eye made an irritated face and pulled the blade away from him with more determination than he had expected you never understand things the first time eilonwy murmured her grip firm on the weapon but i imagine assistant pigkeepers are all alike i told you before youre not to have it and now ill tell you for the second time or is it the third or fourth i must have lost count so saying she wrapped her arms around the scabbard and dropped back to sleep we must rest here taran said to the bard if only a little while at the moment groaned fflewddur who had stretched out full length with his toes and nose pointing straight into the air i dont care who catches me id welcome arawn himself and ask whether he had any breakfast with him the cauldronborn might have lost track of us during the night taran said hopefully but without great conviction i wish i knew how far weve left them behind if weve left them behind at all gurgi brightened a little clever gurgi will know he cried with seekings and peekings in another moment gurgi was halfway up a tall pine he clambered easily to the top and perched there like an enormous crow scanning the land in the direction they had traveled taran meanwhile opened the saddlebags so little food remained that it was hardly worth dividing he and fflewddur agreed to give eilonwy the last of the provisions gurgi had scented food even at the top of the pine tree and he came scuttling down snuffling eagerly at the prospect of his crunchings and munchings stop thinking about eating for a moment taran cried what did you see two warriors are far but gurgi sees them yes yes they are riding full of wickedness and fierceness but there is time for a small crunching gurgi pleaded oh very small for clever valiant gurgi there are no more crunchings said taran if the cauldronborn are still on our heels you had better worry less about food and more about your own skin but gurgi will find munchings very quickly oh yes he is so wise to get them to comfort the bellies of great noble lords but they will forget poor gurgi and not even give him snips and snaps for his eatings after a hurried discussion with fflewddur who looked as ravenous as gurgi taran agreed they might take a little time to search for berries and edible roots quite right said the bard better eat what we can get now while the cauldronborn give us a chance to do it i shall help you i know all about foraging in the woods do it constantly the harp tensed and one string showed signs of giving way no he added quickly i had better stay with eilonwy the truth is i cant tell a mushroom from a toadstool i wish i could it would make the life of a wandering bard considerably more filling with cloaks in which to carry back whatever they might find taran and gurgi set off at a small stream taran halted to fill gwydions leather water flask gurgi sniffing hungrily ran ahead and disappeared into a stand of rowans near the bank of the stream taran discovered mushrooms and gathered them hurriedly bent on his own search he paid little heed to gurgi until he suddenly heard anguished yelps from behind the trees clutching his precious mushrooms taran hastened to see what had happened and came upon gurgi lying in the middle of the grove writhing and whimpering a honeycomb beside him at first taran thought gurgi had got himself stung by bees then he saw the creature was in more serious trouble while gurgi had climbed for the honey a dead branch had snapped under his weight his twisted leg was pinned to the ground with the heavy wood on top of it taran heaved the branch away the panting gurgi shook his head poor gurgis leg is broken he moaned there will be no more amblings and ramblings for him now taran bent and examined the injury the leg was not broken though badly torn and swelling rapidly now gurgis head must be chopped off the creature moaned do it great lord do it quickly gurgi will squeeze up his eyes so as not to see hurtful slashings taran looked closely at gurgi the creature was in earnest his eyes pleaded with taran yes yes cried gurgi now before silent warriors arrive gurgi is better dead at your sword than in their hands gurgi can not walk all will be killed with fearful smitings and bitings it is better no said taran you wont be left in the woods and you wont have your head chopped off by me or anyone else for a moment taran almost regretted his words the poor creature was right he knew the injury would slow their pace and gurgi like all of them would be better off dead than in arawns grasp still taran could not bring himself to draw his sword you and eilonwy can ride melyngar taran said lifting gurgi to his feet and putting one of the creatures hairy arms about his shoulder come on now one step at a time taran was exhausted when they reached eilonwy and the bard the girl had recovered noticeably and was chattering even faster than before while gurgi lay silently on the grass taran divided the honeycomb the portions were pitifully small fflewddur called taran aside your hairy friend is going to make things difficult he said quietly if melyngar carries two riders i dont know how much longer she can keep up that is true said taran yet i see nothing else we can do would you abandon him would you have cut off his head absolutely cried the bard in a flash a fflam never hesitates fortunes of war and all that oh drat and blast there goes another string a thick one too when taran went back to rearrange the weapons they would now be obliged to bear he was surprised to find a large oak leaf on the ground before his cloak on the leaf lay gurgis tiny portion of honeycomb for great lord murmured gurgi gurgi is not hungry for crunchings and munchings today taran looked at the eager face of guru for the first time they smiled at one another your gift is generous taran said softly but you travel as one of us and you will need all your strength keep your share it is yours by right and you have more than earned it he put his hand gently on gurgis shoulder the wet wolfhound odor did not seem as objectionable as before chapter the wolves for a time during the day taran believed they had at last outdistanced the cauldronborn but late that afternoon the warriors reappeared from behind a distant fringe of trees against the westering sun the long shadows of the horsemen reached across the hill slope toward the flatlands where the small troop struggled onward we must stand against them sooner or later taran said wiping his forehead let it be now there can be no victory over the cauldronborn but with luck we can hold them off a little while if eilonwy and gurgi can escape there is still a chance gurgi draped over melyngars saddle immediately set up a great outcry no no faithful gurgi stays with mighty lord who spared his poor tender head happy grateful gurgi will fight too with slashings and gashings we appreciate your sentiments said fflewddur but with that leg of yours youre hardly up to slashing or gashing or anything at all im not going to run either eilonwy put in im tired of running and having my face scratched and my robe torn all on account of those stupid warriors she jumped lightly from the saddle and snatched a bow and a handful of arrows from tarans pack eilonwy stop taran cried these are deathless men they can not be killed although encumbered by the long sword hanging from her shoulder eilonwy ran faster than taran by the time he caught up with her she had climbed a hillock and was stringing the bow the cauldronborn galloped across the plain the sun glinted on their drawn swords taran seized the girl by the waist and tried to pull her away he received a sharp kick in the shins must you always interfere with everything eilonwy asked indignantly before taran could reach for her again she held an arrow toward the sun and murmured a strange phrase she nocked the arrow and loosed it in the direction of the cauldronborn the shaft arched upward and almost disappeared against the bright rays openmouthed taran watched while the shaft began its descent as the arrow plummeted to earth long silvery streamers sprang from its feathers in an instant a huge spiderweb glittered in the air and drifted slowly toward the horsemen fflewddur who had run up just then stopped in amazement great belin he exclaimed whats that it looks like decorations for a feast the web slowly settled over the cauldronborn but the pallid warriors paid it no heed they spurred their mounts onward the strands of the web broke and melted away eilonwy clapped a hand to her mouth it didnt work she cried almost in tears the way achren does it she makes it into a big sticky rope oh its all gone wrong i tried to listen behind the door when she was practicing but ive missed something important she stamped her foot and turned away take her from here taran called to the bard he unsheathed his sword and faced the cauldronborn within moments they would be upon him but even as he braced himself for their onslaught he saw the horsemen falter the cauldronborn reined up suddenly then without a gesture turned their horses and rode silently back toward the hills it worked it worked after all cried the astonished fflewddur eilonwy shook her head no she said with discouragement something turned them away but im afraid it wasnt my spell she unstrung the bow and picked up the arrows she had dropped i think i know what it was taran said they are returning to arawn gwydion told me they could not stay long from annuvin their power must have been waning ever since we left spiral castle and they reached the limit of their strength right here i hope they dont have enough left to get back to annuvin eilonwy said i hope they fall into pieces or shrivel up like bats i doubt that they will taran said watching the horsemen slowly disappear over the ridge they must know how long they can stay and how far they can go and still return to their master he gave eilonwy an admiring glance it doesnt matter theyre gone and that was one of the most amazing things ive ever seen gwydion had a mesh of grass that burst into flame but ive never met anyone else who could make a web like that eilonwy looked at him in surprise her cheeks blushed brighter than the sunset why taran of caer dallben she said i think thats the first polite thing youve said to me then suddenly eilonwy tossed her head and sniffed of course i should have known it was the spiderweb you were more interested in that you didnt care whether i was in danger she strode haughtily back to gurgi and melyngar but thats not true taran called i i was by then eilonwy was out of earshot crestfallen taran followed her i cant make sense out of that girl he said to the bard can you never mind fflewddur said we arent really expected to that night they continued to take turns at standing guard though much of their fear had lifted since the cauldronborn had vanished tarans was the last watch before dawn and he was awake well before eilonwys had ended you had better sleep taran told her ill finish the watch for you im perfectly able to do my own share said eilonwy who had not stopped being irritated at him since the afternoon taran knew better than to insist he picked up his bow and quiver of arrows stood near the dark trunk of an oak and looked out across the moonsilvered meadow nearby fflewddur snored heartily gurgi whose leg had shown no improvement stirred restlessly and whimpered in his sleep you know taran began with embarrassed hesitation that spiderweb i dont want to hear any more about it retorted eilonwy no what i meant was i really was worried about you but the web surprised me so much i forgot to mention it it was courageous of you to stand up against the cauldron warriors i just wanted to tell you that you took long enough getting around to it said eilonwy a tone of satisfaction in her voice but i imagine assistant pigkeepers tend to be slower than what you might expect it probably comes from the kind of work they do dont misunderstand i think its awfully important only its the sort of thing you dont often need to be quick about at first taran went on i thought i would be able to reach caer dathyl by myself i see now that i wouldnt have got even this far without help it is a good destiny that brings me such brave companions there youve done it again eilonwy cried so heatedly that fflewddur choked on one of his snores thats all you care about someone to help you carry spears and swords and whatall it could be anybody and youd be just as pleased taran of caer dallben im not speaking to you any more at home taran said to himself for eilonwy had already pulled a cloak over her head and was feigning sleep nothing ever happened now everything happens but somehow i can never seem to make it come out right with a sigh he held his bow ready and began his turn at guard daylight was long in coming in the morning taran saw gurgis leg was much worse and he left the camp site to search the woods for healing plants glad that coll had taught him the properties of herbs he made a poultice and set it on gurgis wound fflewddur meanwhile had begun drawing new maps with his dagger the cauldron warriors explained the bard had forced the companions too deeply into the ystrad valley returning to their original path would cost them at least two days of hard travel since were this far fflewddur went on we might just as well cross ystrad and follow along the hills staying out of sight of the horned king well be only a few days from caer dathyl and if we keep a good pace we should reach it just in time taran agreed to the new plan it would he realized be more difficult but he judged melyngar could still carry the unfortunate gurgi as long as the companions shared the burden of the weapons eilonwy having forgotten she was not speaking to taran again insisted on walking a days march brought them to the banks of the ystrad taran stole cautiously ahead looking down the broad valley he saw a moving dust cloud when he hurried back and reported this to fflewddur the bard clapped him on the shoulder were ahead of them he said that is excellent news i was afraid theyd be much closer to us and wed have to wait for nightfall to cross ystrad weve saved half a day hurry now and well be into the foothills of eagle mountains before sundown with his precious harp held above his head fflewddur plunged into the river and the others followed here ystrad ran shallow scarcely above eilonwys waist and the companions forded it with little difficulty nevertheless they emerged cold and dripping and the setting sun neither dried nor warmed them leaving the ystrad behind the companions climbed slopes steeper and rockier than any they had traveled before perhaps it was only his imagination but the air of the land around spiral castle had seemed to taran heavy and oppressive approaching the eagle mountains taran felt his burden lighten as he inhaled the dry spicy scent of pine he had planned to continue the march throughout most of the night but gurgis condition had worsened obliging taran to call a halt despite the herbs gurgis leg was badly inflamed and he shivered with fever he looked thin and sad the suggestion of crunchings and munchings could not rouse him even melyngar showed concern as gurgi lay with his eyes half closed his parched lips tight against his teeth the white mare nuzzled him delicately whinnying and blowing out her breath anxiously as if attempting to comfort him as best she could taran risked lighting a small fire he and fflewddur stretched gurgi out beside it while eilonwy held up the suffering creatures head and gave him a drink from the leather flask taran and the bard moved a little away and spoke quietly between themselves i have done all i know taran said if there is anything else it lies beyond my skill he shook his head sorrowfully he has failed badly today and there is so little of him left i believe i could pick him up with one hand caer dathyl is not far away said fflewddur but our friend i fear may not live to see it that night wolves howled in the darkness beyond the fire all next day the wolves followed them sometimes silently sometimes barking as if in signal to one another they remained always out of bow shot but taran caught sight of the lean gray shapes flickering in and out of the scrubby trees as long as they dont come any closer he said to the bard we neednt worry about them oh they wont attack us fflewddur answered not now at any rate they can be infuriatingly patient if they know someones wounded he turned an anxious glance toward gurgi for them its just a matter of waiting well i must say youre a cheerful one remarked eilonwy you sound as if all we had to look forward to was being gobbled up if they attack we shall stand them off taran said quietly gurgi was willing to give up his life for us i can do no less for him above all we must not lose heart so close to the end of our journey a fflam never loses heart cried the bard come wolves or what have you nevertheless uneasiness settled over the companions as the gray shapes continued trailing them and melyngar docile and obedient until now turned skittish the goldenmaned horse tossed her head and rolled her eyes at every attempt to lead her to make matters worse fflewddur declared their progress through the hills was too slow if we go any farther east said the bard well run into some really high mountains the condition were in we couldnt possibly climb them but here were practically walled in every path has led us roundabout the cliffs there he went on pointing toward the towering mass of rock to his left are too rugged to get over i had thought wed find a pass before now well thats the way of it we can only keep on bearing north as much as possible the wolves dont seem to have any trouble finding their way said eilonwy my dear girl answered the bard with some indignation if i were able to run on four legs and sniff my dinner a mile away i doubt id have any difficulties either eilonwy giggled id love to see you try she said we do have someone who can run on four legs taran said suddenly melyngar if anyone can find their way to caer dathyl she can the bard snapped his fingers thats it he cried every horse knows its way home its worth trying and we cant be worse off than we are now for an assistant pigkeeper said eilonwy to taran you do come up with some interesting ideas now and then when the companions started off again taran dropped the bridle and gave melyngar her head with the halfconscious gurgi bound to her saddle the white horse trotted swiftly ahead at a determined gait by midafternoon melyngar discovered one pass which fflewddur admitted he himself would have overlooked as the day wore on melyngar led them swiftly through rocky defiles to high ridges it was all the companions could do to keep up with her when she cantered into a long ravine taran lost sight of her for a moment and hurried forward in time to glimpse the mare as she turned sharply around an outcropping of white stone calling the bard and eilonwy to follow quickly taran ran on ahead he stopped suddenly to his left on a high shelf of rock crouched an enormous wolf with golden eyes and lolling red tongue before taran could draw his sword the lean animal sprang chapter the hidden valley the impact of the heavy furry body caught taran full in the chest and sent him tumbling as he fell he caught a glimpse of fflewddur the bard too had been borne to earth under the paws of another wolf eilonwy still stood though a third animal crouched in front of her tarans hand flew to his sword the gray wolf seized his arm the animals teeth however did not sink into his flesh but held him in an unshakeable grip at the end of the ravine a huge robed figure suddenly appeared melyngar stood behind him the man raised his arm and spoke a command immediately the wolf holding taran relaxed his jaws and drew away as obediently as a dog the man strode toward taran who scrambled to his feet you have saved our lives taran began we are grateful the man spoke again to the wolves and the animals crowded around him whining and wagging their tails he was a strangelooking figure broad and muscular with the vigor of an ancient but sturdy tree his white hair reached below his shoulders and his beard hung to his waist around his forehead he wore a narrow band of gold set with a single blue jewel from these creatures he said in a deep voice that was stern but not unkind your lives were never in danger but you must leave this place it is not an abode for the race of men we were lost taran said we had been following our horse melyngar the man turned a pair of keen gray eyes on taran under his deep brow they sparkled like frost in a valley melyngar brought me four of you i understood young gurgi was alone by all means then if you are friends of melyngar it is melyngar isnt it she looks so much like her mother and there are so many i can not always keep track of the names i know who you are cried taran you are medwyn am i now the man answered with a smile that furrowed his face yes i have been called medwyn but how should you know that i am taran of caer dallben gwydion prince of don was my companion and he spoke of you before before his death he was journeying to caer dathyl as we are now i never hoped to find you you were quite right medwyn answered you could not have found me only the animals know my valley melyngar led you here taran you say of caer dallben he put an enormous hand to his forehead let me see yes there are visitors from caer dallben i am sure tarans heart leaped hen wen he cried medwyn gave him a puzzled glance were you seeking her now that is curious no she is not here but i had thought we will speak of hen wen later said medwyn your friend is badly injured you know come i shall do what i can for him he motioned for them to follow the wolves padded silently behind taran eilonwy and the bard where melyngar waited at the end of the ravine medwyn lifted gurgi from the saddle as if the creature weighed no more than a squirrel gurgi lay quietly in medwyns arms the group descended a narrow footpath medwyn strode ahead as slowly and powerfully as if a tree were walking the old mans feet were bare but the sharp stones and pebbles did not trouble him the path turned abruptly then turned again medwyn passed through a cut in a bare shoulder of the cliff and the next thing taran knew they suddenly emerged into a green sunlit valley mountains seemingly impassable rose on all sides here the air was gentler without the tooth of the wind the grass spread rich and tender before him set among tall hemlocks were low white cottages not unlike those of caer dallben at the sight of them taran felt a pang of homesickness against the face of the slope behind the cottages he saw what appeared at first to be rows of mosscovered tree trunks as he looked to his surprise they seemed more like the weather worn ribs and timbers of a long ship the earth covered them almost entirely grass and meadow flowers had sprung up to obliterate them further and make them part of the mountain itself i must say the old fellows well tucked away here whispered fflewddur i could never have found the path in and i doubt i could find the path out taran nodded the valley was the most beautiful he had ever seen cattle grazed peacefully in the meadow near the hemlocks a small lake caught the sky and sparkled blue and white the bright plumage of birds flashed among the trees even as he stepped across the lush green of the turf taran felt exhaustion drain from his aching body theres a fawn eilonwy cried with delight from behind the cottages a speckled longlegged fawn appeared sniffed the air then trotted quickly toward medwyn the graceful creature paid no attention to the wolves but frisked gaily at the old mans side the animal drew shyly away from the strangers but her curiosity got the better of her and soon she was nuzzling eilonwys hand ive never seen a fawn this close said the girl achren never had any pets none that would stay with her at any rate i cant blame them at all this one is lovely it makes you feel all tingly as if you were touching the wind medwyn motioning for them to wait carried gurgi into the largest of the cottages the wolves sat on their haunches and watched the travelers through slanted eyes taran unsaddled melyngar who began cropping the tender grass halfadozen chickens clucked and pecked around a neat white henhouse the rooster raised his head to show a notched comb those are dallbens chickens cried taran they must be theres the brown hen the white id know that comb anywhere he hurried over and clucked at them the chickens more interested in eating paid little attention medwyn reappeared in the doorway he carried an enormous wicker basket laden with jugs of milk with cheese honeycombs and fruits that in the lowlands would not be in season for another month i shall look after your friend directly he said meantime i thought you might enjoy oh yes so youve found them have you he said noticing taran with the chickens those are my visitors from caer dallben there should be a swarm of bees too somewhere about they flew away taran said the same day hen wen ran off then i imagine they came straight here medwyn said the chickens were petrified with fright i could make no sense at all out of them oh they settled down quickly enough but of course by that time they had forgotten why they flew off in the first place you know how chickens are imagining the world coming to an end one moment then pecking corn the next they shall all fly back when theyre ready have no fear though its unfortunate dallben and coll should be put out in the matter of eggs i would ask you inside medwyn continued but the disorder at the moment there were bears at breakfast and you can imagine the state of things so i must ask you to attend to yourselves if you would rest there is straw in the byre it should not be too uncomfortable for you the travelers lost no time helping themselves to medwyns provisions or in finding the byre the sweet scent of hay filled the lowceilinged building they scooped out nests in the straw uncovering one of medwyns breakfast guests curled up and fast asleep fflewddur at first uneasy was finally convinced the bear had no appetite for bards and soon began snoring eilonwy dropped off to sleep in the middle of one of her sentences taran had no desire to rest medwyns valley had refreshed him more than a nights slumber he left the byre and strolled across the meadow at the far side of the lake otters had built a slide and were amusing themselves by tumbling down it at tarans approach they stopped for a moment raised their heads to look at him as though sorry he was unable to join them and returned to their game a fish broke water in a twinkle of silver scales the ripples widened until the last of them lapped gently at the shore medwyn taran saw had gardens of both flowers and vegetables behind the cottage to his surprise taran found himself yearning to work with coll in his own vegetable plot the weeding and hoeing he had so despised at caer dallben now seemed as he thought of his past journey and the journey yet to come infinitely pleasant he sat down by the rim of the lake and looked across to the hills with the sun resting above the peaks the wooden skeleton of the great ship stood out sharply against the mound which nearly enveloped it he had little chance to study it for medwyn appeared walking deliberately across the field the fawn trotted beside him the three wolves followed with his brown robe and white hair medwyn looked as broad and solid as a snowcapped mountain gurgi is more comfortable than he was the ancient man said in his deep voice the fawn danced at the lake shore while medwyn ponderously sat down and leaned his huge head toward taran he will recover well there is no longer any danger not at least while he is here i have thought long of gurgi taran said looking frankly into the old mans gray eyes he explained then the reason for his journey and the events leading to gurgis accident medwyn listened carefully head cocked to one side thoughtful while taran recounted gurgis willingness to sacrifice his own life rather than endanger the others at first i wasnt too fond of him taran admitted now ive begun to like him in spite of all his whining and complaining every living thing deserves our respect said medwyn knitting his shaggy brows be it humble or proud ugly or beautiful i wouldnt want to say that about the gwythaints taran answered i feel only sorrow for those unhappy creatures medwyn said once long ago they were as free as other birds gentle and trusting in his cunning arawn lured them to him and brought them under his power he built the iron cages which are now their prison house in annuvin the tortures he inflicted on the gwythaints were shameful and unspeakable now they serve him out of terror thus would he strive to corrupt every animal in prydain no less than the race of men that is one of the reasons i remain in this valley here arawn can not harm them even so were he to become ruler of this land i doubt i could help them all those who fell into his clutches would be counted fortunate if they perished quickly taran nodded i understand more and more why i must warn the sons of don as for gurgi i wonder if it wouldnt be safer for him to stay here safer asked medwyn yes certainly but you would hurt him grievously were you to turn him away now gurgis misfortune is that he is neither one thing nor the other at the moment he has lost the wisdom of animals and has not gained the learning of men therefore both shun him were he to do something purposeful it would mean much to him i doubt he will delay your journey for he will be able to walk as well as you by tomorrow easily i urge you to take him he may even find his own way of serving you neither refuse to give help when it is needed medwyn continued nor refuse to accept it when it is offered gwythyr son of greidawl learned that from a lame ant you know a lame ant taran shook his head dallben has taught me much about ants but nothing of a lame one it is a long history medwyn said and perhaps you will hear all of it another time for the moment you need only know that when kilhuch or was it his father no it was young kilhuch very well when young kilhuch sought the hand of the fair olwen he was given a number of tasks by her father yspadadden he was chief giant at the time what the tasks were does not concern us now except that they were very nigh impossible and kilhuch could not have accomplished them without the aid of his companions one of the tasks was to gather nine bushels of flax seed though there was scarcely that much in all the land for the sake of his friend gwythyr son of greidawl undertook to do this while he was walking over the hills wondering how he might accomplish it he heard a grievous wailing from an anthill a fire had started around it and the ants were in danger of their lives gwythyr yes im quite sure it was gwythyr drew his sword and beat out the fire in gratitude the ants combed every field until they had collected the nine bushels yet the chief giant a picky and disagreeable sort claimed the measure was not complete one flax seed was missing and must be delivered before nightfall gwythyr had no idea where he could find another flax seed but at last just as the sun had begun to set up hobbled a lame ant carrying a heavy burden it was the single flax seed and so the last measure was filled i have studied the race of men medwyn continued i have seen that alone you stand as weak reeds by a lake you must learn to help yourselves that is true but you must also learn to help one another are you not all of you lame ants taran was silent medwyn put his hand into the lake and stirred the water after a moment a venerable salmon rippled up medwyn stroked the jaws of the huge fish what place is this taran finally asked in a hushed voice are you indeed medwyn you speak of the race of men as if you were not one of them this is a place of peace medwyn said and therefore not suitable for men at least not yet until it is i hold this valley for creatures of the forests and the waters in their mortal danger they come to me if they have the strength to do so and in their pain and grief do you not believe that animals know grief and fear and pain the world of men is not an easy one for them dallben said taran taught me that when the black waters flooded prydain ages ago nevvid nav neivion built a ship and carried with him two of every living creature the waters drained away the ship came to rest no man knows where but the animals who came safe again into the world remembered and their young have never forgotten and here taran said pointing toward the hillside i see a ship far from water gwydion called you medwyn but i ask i am medwyn answered the whitebearded man for all that my name may concern you that is not important now my own concern is for hen wen you have seen nothing of her then medwyn shook his head what lord gwydion said is true of all places in prydain she would have come here first especially if she sensed her life in danger but there has been no sign no rumor yet she would find her way sooner or later unless taran felt a chill ripple at his heart unless she has been killed he murmured do you think that has happened i do not know medwyn answered though i fear it may be so chapter the black lake that night medwyn prepared a feast for the travelers the disorder left by the breakfasting bears had been cleared away the cottage was snug and neat though even smaller than caer dallben taran could see that medwyn was indeed unused to entertaining human visitors for his table was barely long enough to seat them all and for chairs he had been obliged to make do with benches and milking stools medwyn sat at the head of the table the fawn had gone to sleep but the wolves crouched at his feet and grinned happily on the back of his chair perched a gigantic goldenplumed eagle watching every movement with sharp unblinking eyes fflewddur though still apprehensive did not allow his fear to affect his appetite he ate enough for three without showing the least sign of becoming full but when he asked for another portion of venison medwyn gave a long chuckle and explained to the amazed fflewddur it was not meat at all but vegetables prepared according to his own recipe of course it is eilonwy told the bard you wouldnt expect him to cook his guests would you that would be like asking someone to dinner and then roasting him really i think bards are as muddled as assistant pigkeepers neither one of you seems to think very clearly as much as he welcomed food and the chance to rest taran was silent throughout the meal and continued so when he retired to his nest of straw until now he had never imagined hen wen might not be alive he had spoken again with medwyn but the old man could give him no assurance wakeful taran left the byre and stood outside looking at the sky in the clear air the stars were bluewhite closer than he had ever seen them he tried to turn his thoughts from hen wen reaching caer dathyl was the task he had undertaken and that in itself would be difficult enough an owl passed overhead silent as ashes the shadow appearing noiselessly beside him was medwyn not asleep medwyn asked a restless night is no way to begin a journey it is a journey i am eager to end taran said there are times when i fear i shall not see caer dallben again it is not given to men to know the ends of their journeys medwyn answered it may be that you will never return to the places dearest to you but how can that matter if what you must do is here and now i think said taran longingly that if i knew i were not to see my own home again i would be happy to stay in this valley your heart is young and unformed medwyn said yet if i read it well you are of the few i would welcome here indeed you may stay if you so choose surely you can entrust your task to your friends no said taran after a long pause i have taken it on myself through my own choice if that is so answered medwyn then you can give it up through your own choice from all over the valley it seemed to taran there came voices urging him to remain the hemlocks whispered of rest and peace the lake spoke of sunlight lingering in its depths the joy of otters at their games he turned away no he said quickly my decision was made long before this then medwyn answered gently so be it he put a hand on tarans brow i grant you all that you will allow me to grant a nights rest sleep well taran remembered nothing of returning to the byre or falling asleep but he rose in the morning sunlight refreshed and strengthened eilonwy and the bard had already finished their breakfast and taran was delighted to see that gurgi had joined them as taran approached gurgi gave a yelp of joy and turned gleeful somersaults oh joy he cried gurgi is ready for new walkings and stalkings oh yes and new seekings and peekings great lords have been kind to happy jolly gurgi taran noticed medwyn had not only healed the creatures leg he had also given him a bath and a good combing gurgi looked only half as twiggy and leafy as usual in addition as he saddled melyngar taran found that medwyn had packed the saddlebags with food and had included warm cloaks for all of them the old man called the travelers around him and seated himself on the ground the armies of the horned king are by now a days march ahead of you he said but if you follow the paths i shall reveal and move quickly you may regain the time you have lost it is even possible for you to reach caer dathyl a day perhaps two before them however i warn you the mountain ways are not easy if you prefer i shall set you on a path toward the valley of ystrad once again then we would be following the horned king taran said there would be less chance of overtaking him and much danger too do not think the mountains are not dangerous medwyn said though it is danger of a different sort a fflam thrives on danger cried the bard let it be the mountains or the homed kings hosts i fear neither not to any great extent he added quickly we shall risk the mountains taran said for once eilonwy interrupted youve decided the right thing the mountains certainly arent going to throw spears at us no matter how dangerous they are i really think youre improving listen carefully then medwyn ordered as he spoke his hands moved deftly in the soft earth before him molding a tiny model of the hills which taran found easier to follow than fflewddurs map scratchings when he finished and the travelers gear and weapons were secured on melyngars back medwyn led the group from the valley as closely as taran observed each step of the way he knew the path to medwyns valley would be lost to him as soon as the ancient man left them in a little while medwyn stopped your path now lies to the north he said and here we shall part and you taran of caer dallben whether you have chosen wisely you will learn from your own heart perhaps we shall meet again and you will tell me until then farewell before taran could turn and thank medwyn the white bearded man disappeared as if the hills had swallowed him up and the travelers stood by themselves on a rocky windswept plateau well said fflewddur hitching up the harp behind him i somehow feel that if we meet any more wolves theyll know were friends of medwyn the first days march was less difficult than taran had feared this time he led the way for the bard admitted after a number of harp strings had snapped that he had not been able to keep all medwyns directions in his head they climbed steadily until long after the sun had turned westward and though the ground was rough and broken the path medwyn had indicated lay dearly before them mountain streams whose water ran cold and clear made winding lines of sparkling silver as they danced down the slopes into the distant valley lands the air was bracing yet with a cold edge which made the travelers grateful for the cloaks medwyn had given them at a long cleft protected from the wind taran signaled a halt they had made excellent progress during the day far more than he had expected and he saw no reason to exhaust themselves by forcing a march during the night tethering melyngar to one of the stunted trees that grew in the heights the travelers made camp since there was no further danger from the cauldronborn and the hosts of the horned king moved far below and to the west of the group taran deemed it safe to build a fire medwyns provisions needed no cooking but the blaze warmed and cheered them as the night shadows drifted from the peaks eilonwy lit her golden sphere and set it in the crevice of a faulted rock gurgi who had not uttered a single moan or groan during this part of the journey perched on a boulder and began scratching himself luxuriously although after medwyns washing and combing it was more through habit than anything else the bard as lean as ever despite the huge amount he had eaten repaired his harp strings youve been carrying that harp ever since i met you eilonwy said and youve never once played it thats like telling somebody you want to talk to them and when they get ready to listen you dont say anything youd hardly expect me to go strumming out airs while those cauldron warriors were following us fflewddur said somehow i didnt think it would be appropriate but a fflam is always obliging so if youd really care to hear me play he added looking both delighted and embarrassed he cradled the instrument in one arm and almost before his fingers touched the strings a gentle melody as beautiful as the curve of the harp itself lifted like a voice singing without words to tarans ear the melody had its own words weaving a supple thread among the rising notes home home they sang and beyond the words themselves so fleeting he could not be quite sure of them were the fields and orchards of caer dallben the gold afternoons of autumn and the crisp winter mornings with pink sunlight on the snow then the harp fell silent fflewddur sat with his head bent close to the strings a curious expression on his long face well that was a surprise said the bard at last i had planned something a little more lively the sort of thing my war leader always enjoys to put us in a bold frame of mind you understand the truth of the matter is he admitted with a slight tone of discouragement i dont really know whats going to come out of it next my fingers go along but sometimes i think this harp plays of itself perhaps fflewddur continued thats why taliesin thought he was doing me a favor when he gave it to me because when i went up to the council of bards for my examination i had an old pot one of the minstrels had left behind and i couldnt do more than plunk out a few chants however a fflam never looks a gift horse in the mouth or in this case i should say harp it was a sad tune eilonwy said but the odd thing about it is you dont mind the sadness its like feeling better after youve had a good cry it made me think of the sea again though i havent been there since i was a little girl at this taran snorted but eilonwy paid no attention to him the waves break against the cliffs and churn into foam and farther out as far as you can see there are the white crests the white horses of llyr they call them but theyre really only waves waiting their turn to roll in strange said the bard personally i was thinking of my own castle its small and drafty but i would like to see it again a person can have enough wandering you know it made me think i might even settle down again and try to be a respectable sort of king caer dallben is closer to my heart taran said when i left i never gave it too much thought now i think of it a great deal gurgi who had been listening silently set up a long howl yes yes soon great warriors will all be back in their halls telling their tales with laughings and chaffings then it will be the fearful forest again for poor gurgi to put down his tender head in snoozings and snorings gurgi taran said i promise to bring you to caer dallben if i ever get there myself and if you like it and dallben agrees you can stay there as long as you want what joy gurgi cried honest toiling gurgi extends thanks and best wishes oh yes fond obedient gurgi will work hard for now obedient gurgi had better sleep taran advised and so should we all medwyn has put us well on our way and it cant take much longer well start again at daybreak during the night however a gale rose and by morning a drenching rain beat into the cleft instead of slackening the wind gained in force and screamed over the rocks it beat like a fist against the travelers shelter then pried with searching fingers as if to seize and dash them into the valley they set out nevertheless holding their cloaks before their faces to make matters worse the path broke off entirely and sheer cliffs loomed ahead of them the rain stopped after the travelers had all been soaked to the skin but now the rocks were slippery and treacherous even the surefooted melyngar stumbled once and for a breathless moment taran feared she would be lost the mountains swung a halfcircle around a lake black and sullen below threatening clouds taran halted on an outcropping of stone and pointed toward the hills at the far side of the lake according to what medwyn told us he said to the bard we should make for that notch all the way over there but i see no purpose in following the mountains when we can cut almost straight across the lake shore is flat at least while here its getting practically impossible to climb fflewddur rubbed his pointed nose even counting the time it would take us to go down and come up again i think we should save several hours yes i definitely believe its worth trying medwyn didnt say a word about crossing valleys eilonwy put in he didnt say anything about cliffs like these answered taran they seem nothing to him hes lived here a long time for us its something else again if you dont listen to what somebody tells you eilonwy remarked its like putting your fingers in your ears and jumping down a well for an assistant pigkeeper whos done very little traveling you suddenly know all about it who found the way out of the barrow taran retorted its decided we cross the valley the descent was laborious but once they had reached level ground taran felt all the more convinced they would save time holding melyngars bridle he led the group along the narrow shore the lake reached closely to the base of the hills obliging taran to splash through the shallows the lake he realized was not black in reflection of the sky the water itself was dark flat and as grim and heavy as iron the bottom too was as treacherous as the rocks above despite his care taran lurched and nearly got a ducking when he turned to warn the others to his surprise he saw gurgi in water up to his waist and heading toward the center of the lake fflewddur and eilonwy were also splashing farther and farther from land dont go through the water taran called keep to the shore wish we could the bard shouted back but were stuck somehow theres a terribly strong pull a moment later taran understood what the bard meant an unexpected swell knocked him off his feet and even as he put out his hands to break his fall the black lake sucked him down beside him melyngar thrashed her legs and whinnied the sky spun overhead he was pulled along like a twig in a torrent eilonwy shot past him he tried to regain his footing and catch her it was too late he skimmed and bobbed over the surface the far shore would stop them taran thought struggling to keep his head above the waves a roar filled his ears the middle of the lake was a whirlpool clutching and flinging him to the depths black water closed over him and he knew he was drowning chapter king eiddileg down he spun battling for air in a flood that broke upon him like a crumbling mountain faster and faster the waters bore him along tossing him right and left taran collided with something what it was he could not tell but he clung to it even as his strength failed him there was a crash as though the earth had split asunder the water turned to foam and taran felt himself dashed against an unyielding wall he remembered nothing more when he opened his eyes he was lying on a hard smooth surface his hand tightly gripping fflewddurs harp he heard the rush of water close by cautiously he felt around him his fingers touched only wet flat stone an embankment of some kind a pale blue light shone high above him taran decided he had come to rest in a cave or grotto he raised himself and his movement set the harp to jangling hello whos that a voice echoed down the embankment faint though it was taran recognized it as belonging to the bard he scrambled to his feet and crept in the direction of the sound on the way he tripped over a form which became suddenly vocal and indignant youve done very well taran of caer dallben with all your short cuts whats left of me is soaked to the skin and i cant find my bauble oh here it is all wet of course and who knows whats happened to the rest of us the golden light flared dimly to reveal the dripping face of eilonwy her blue eyes flashing with vexation gurgis hairy sputtering shadow rolled toward them oh poor tender head is filled with sloshings and washings in another moment fflewddur had found them melyngar whinnied behind him i thought i heard my harp down here he said i couldnt believe it at first never expected to see it again but a fflam never despairs quite a stroke of luck though i never thought id see anything again taran said handing the instrument to fflewddur weve been washed into a cave of some kind but its not a natural one look at these flagstones if youd look at melyngar eilonwy called youd see all our provisions are gone all our weapons too thanks to your precious short cut it was true the straps had broken loose and the saddle had torn away in the whirlpool luckily the companions still had their swords im sorry taran said i admit we are here through my fault i should not have followed this path but whats done is done i led us here and ill find a way out he glanced around the roar of water came from a wide swiftrunning canal the embankment itself was much broader than he had realized lights of various colors glowed in the high arches he turned to his companions again this is very curious we seem to be deep underground but it isnt the lake bottom before he could utter another word he was seized from behind and a bag smelling strongly of onions was jammed over his head eilonwy screamed then her voice grew muffled taran was being halfpushed halfpulled in two directions at once gurgi began yelping furiously here get that one a gruff voice shouted get him yourself cant you see ive got my hands full taran struck out a solid round ball that must have been someones head butted him in the stomach there were slapping noises filtering through the oniony darkness around him those would be from eilonwy now he was pushed from behind propelled at top speed while angry voices shouted at him and at each other hustle along there you fool you didnt take their swords at this came another shriek from eilonwy the sound of what might have been a kick then a moment of silence all right let them keep their swords youll have the blame of it letting them approach king eiddileg with weapons at a blind trot taran was shoved through what seemed a large crowd of people everyone was talking at once the noise was deafening after a number of turns he was thrust forward again a heavy door snapped behind him the onion bag was snatched from his head taran blinked with fflewddur and eilonwy he stood in the center of a highvaulted chamber glittering with lights gurgi was nowhere in sight their captors were halfadozen squat round stubbylegged warriors axes hung from their belts and each man had a bow and quiver of arrows on his shoulder the left eye of the short burly fellow who stood beside eilonwy was turning greenishblack before them at a long stone table a dwarfish figure with a bristling yellow beard glared at the warriors he wore a robe of garish red and green rings sparkled on his plump fingers whats this he shouted who are these people didnt i give orders i wasnt to be disturbed but majesty began one of the warriors shifting uneasily we caught them must you bother me with details king eiddileg cried clasping his forehead youll ruin me youll be the death of me out out no not the prisoners you idiots shaking his head sighing and sputtering the king collapsed onto a throne carved from rock the guards scurried away king eiddileg shot a furious glance at taran and his companions now then out with it what do you want you might as well know ahead of time you shant have it sire taran began we ask no more than safe passage through your realm the four of us theres only three of you king eiddileg snapped cant you count one of my companions is missing taran said regretfully he had hoped gurgi would have overcome his fear but he could not blame the creature for running off after his ordeal in the whirlpool i beg your servants to help us find him then too our provisions and weapons have been lost thats clotted nonsense shouted the king dont lie to me i cant stand it he pulled an orange kerchief from his sleeve and mopped his forehead why did you come here because an assistant pigkeeper led us on a wildgoose chase eilonwy interrupted we dont even know where we are let alone why its worse than rolling downhill in the dark naturally said eiddileg his voice dripping with sarcasm you have no idea youre in the very heart of the kingdom of tylwyth teg the fair folk the happy family the little people or whatever other insipid irritating names youve put on us oh no of course not you just happened to be passing by we were caught in the lake taran protested it pulled us down good eh king eiddileg answered with a quick smile of pride ive added some improvements of my own of course if youre so anxious to keep visitors away eilonwy said you should have something better to make people stay out when people get this close eiddileg answered theyre already too close at that point i dont want them out i want them in fflewddur shook his head i always understood the fair folk were all over prydain not just here of course not just here said eiddileg with impatience this is the royal seat why we have tunnels and mines every place you can imagine but the real work the real labor of organization is here right here in this very spot in this very throne room on my shoulders its too much i tell you too much but who else can you trust if you want something done right the king stopped suddenly and drummed his glittering fingers on the stone table thats not your affair he said youre in trouble enough as it is it cant be overlooked i dont see any work being done said eilonwy before taran could warn eilonwy not to be imprudent the door of the throne room burst open and a crowd of folk pressed in looking closer taran saw not all were dwarfs some were tall slender with white robes others were covered with glistening scales like fish still others fluttered large delicate wings for some moments taran heard nothing but a confusion of voices angry outcries and bickering with eiddileg trying to shout above them finally the king managed to push them all out again no work being done he cried you dont appreciate everything that goes into it the children of evening thats another ridiculous name you humans have thought up are to sing in the forest of cantrev mawr tonight they havent even practiced two are sick and one cant be found the lake sprites have been quarreling all day now theyre sulking their hairs a mess and who does that reflect on who has to jolly them along coax them plead with them the answer is obvious what thanks do i get for it king eiddileg ranted on none at all has any of you longlegged gawks ever taken the trouble even once mind you to offer the simplest expression of gratitude such as thank you king eiddileg for the tremendous effort and inconvenience youve gone to so that we can enjoy a little charm and beauty in the world above which would be so unspeakably grim without you and your fair folk just a few words of honest appreciation by no means just the opposite if any of you thickskulled oafs come on one of the fair folk above ground what happens you seize him you grab him with your great hammy hands and try to make him lead you to buried treasure or you squeeze him until you get three wishes out of him not satisfied with one oh no but three well i dont mind telling you this eiddileg went on his face turning redder by the moment ive put an end to all this wishgranting and treasurescavenging no more absolutely not im surprised you didnt ruin us long ago just then a chorus of voices rose from behind the door of eiddilegs throne room the harmonies penetrated even the walls of heavy stone taran had never in his life heard such beautiful singing he listened enchanted forgetting for the moment all but the soaring melody eiddileg himself stopped shouting and puffing until the voices died away thats something to be thankful for the king said at last the children of evening have evidently got together again not as good as you might want but theyll manage somehow i have not heard the songs of the fair folk until now taran said i had never realized how lovely they were dont try to flatter me eiddileg cried trying to look furious yet beaming at the same time what surprises me eilonwy said while the bard plucked meditatively at his harp trying to recapture the notes of the song is why you go to so much trouble if you fair folk dislike all of us above ground why do you bother professional pride my dear girl said the dwarf king putting a chubby hand to his heart and bowing slightly when we fair folk do something we do it right oh yes he sighed never mind the sacrifices we make its a task that needs doing and so we do it never mind the cost for myself he added with a wave of his hand it doesnt matter ive lost sleep ive lost weight but thats not important if king eiddileg had lost weight taran thought to himself what must he have been like beforehand he decided against asking this question well i appreciate it eilonwy said i think its amazing what youve been able to do you must be extremely clever and any assistant pigkeepers who happen to be in this throne room might do well to pay attention thank you dear girl said king eiddileg bowing lower i see youre the sort of person one can talk to intelligently its unheard of for one of you big shambling louts to have any kind of insight into these matters but you at least seem to understand the problems we face sire interrupted taran we understand your time is precious let us disturb you no more give us safe conduct to caer dathyl what shouted eiddileg leave here impossible unheard of once youre with the fair folk my good lad you stay and no mistake about it oh i suppose i could stretch a point for the sake of the young lady and let you off easily only put you to sleep for fifty years or turn you all into bats but that would be a pure favor mind you our task is urgent taran cried even now we have delayed too long thats your concern not mine eiddileg shrugged then we shall make our own way taran shouted drawing his sword fflewddurs blade leaped out and the bard stood with taran ready to fight more clotted nonsense king eiddileg said looking contemptuously at the swords pointed toward him he shook his fingers at them there and there now you might try to move your arms taran strained every muscle his body felt turned to stone put your swords away and lets talk this over calmly said the dwarf king gesturing again if you give me any decent reason why i should let you go i might think it over and answer you promptly say in a year or two there could be no use taran saw in concealing the reasons for his journey he explained to eiddileg what had befallen them the dwarf king ceased his blustering at the mention of arawn but when taran had finished king eiddileg shook his head this is a conflict you great gawks must attend to yourselves the fair folk owe you no allegiance he said angrily prydain belonged to us before the race of men came you drove us underground you plundered our mines you blundering clodpoles you stole our treasures and you keep on stealing them you clumsy oafs sire taran answered i can speak for no man but myself i have never robbed you and i have no wish to my task means more to me than your treasures if there is ill will between the fair folk and the race of men then it is a matter to be settled between them but if the horned king triumphs if the shadow of annuvin falls on the land above you arawns hand will reach your deepest caverns for an assistant pigkeeper said eiddileg youre reasonably eloquent but the fair folk will worry about arawn when the time comes the time has come taran said i only hope it has not passed i dont think you really know whats going on above ground eilonwy suddenly exclaimed you talk about charm and beauty and sacrificing yourself to make things pleasant for people i dont believe you care a bit for that youre too conceited and stubborn and selfish conceited shouted eiddileg his eyes popping selfish you wont find anyone more openhearted and generous how dare you say that what do you want my lifes blood with that he tore off his cloak and threw it in the air pulled the rings from his fingers and tossed them in every direction go ahead take it all leave me ruined what else do you want my whole kingdom do you want to leave go by all means the sooner the better stubborn im too soft it will be the death of me but little you care at that moment the door of the throne room burst open again two dwarf warriors clung frantically to gurgi who swung them about as if they were rabbits joyous greetings faithful gurgi is back with mighty heroes this time valiant gurgi did not run oh no no brave gurgi fought with great whackings and smackings he triumphed but then mighty lords are carried away clever gurgi goes seeking and peeking to save them yes and he finds them but that is not all oh faithful honest fearless gurgi finds more surprises and delights oh joy gurgi was so excited that he began dancing on one foot spinning around and clapping his hands mighty warriors go to seek a piggy it is clever wise gurgi who finds her hen wen cried taran where is she here mighty lord gurgi shouted the piggy is here chapter doli taran turned accusingly to king eiddileg you said nothing of hen wen you didnt ask me said eiddileg thats sharp practice fflewddur muttered even for a king its worse than a lie taran said angrily youd have let us go our way and wed never have known what happened to her you should be ashamed of yourself eilonwy put in shaking her finger at the king who appeared most embarrassed at being found out its like looking the other way when someones about to walk into a hole finders keepers the dwarf king snapped a troop of the fair folk came on her near the avren banks she was running through a ravine and ill tell you something you dont know halfadozen warriors were after her the henchmen of the horned king the troop took care of those warriors we have our own ways of dealing with you clumsy lummoxes and they brought your pig here underground most of the way no wonder gwydion could find no tracks taran murmured to himself the fair folk rescued her eiddileg angrily continued turning bright red and theres another fine example do i get a word of thanks naturally not but i do get called disagreeable names and have nasty thoughts thrown at me oh i can see it in your faces eiddileg is a thief and a wretch thats what youre saying to yourselves well just for that you shant have her back and youll stay here all of you until i feel like letting you go eilonwy gasped with indignation if you do that she cried you are a thief and a wretch you gave me your word the fair folk dont go back on their word there was no mention of a pig no mention at all eiddileg clapped his hands over his paunch and snapped his mouth shut no taran said there was not but there is a question of honesty and honor eiddileg blinked and looked sideways he took out his orange kerchief and mopped his brow again honor he muttered yes i was afraid youd come to that true the fair folk never break their word well he sighed thats the price for being openhearted and generous so be it you shall have your pig we shall need weapons to replace those we lost taran said what screamed eiddileg are you trying to ruin me and crunchings and munchings piped up gurgi taran nodded provisions as well this is going too far eiddileg shouted youre bleeding me to death weapons food pigs and we beg for a guide who will show us the way to caer dathyl at this eiddileg nearly exploded when finally he calmed himself he nodded reluctantly i shall lend you doli he said he is the only one i can spare he clapped his hands and gave orders to the armed dwarfs then turned to the companions off with you now before i change my mind eilonwy stepped quickly to the throne bent and kissed eiddileg on the top of his head thank you she whispered youre a perfectly lovely king out out the dwarf cried as the stone door closed behind him taran saw king eiddileg fondling his head and beaming happily the troop of fair folk led the company down the vaulted corridors taran had at first imagined eiddilegs realm to be no more than a maze of underground galleries to his astonishment the corridors soon broadened into wide avenues in the great domes far overhead gems glittered as bright as sunshine there was no grass but deep carpets of green lichen stretched out like meadows there were blue lakes glistening as much as the jewels above and cottages and small farmhouses it was difficult for taran and his companions to realize they were underground ive been thinking whispered fflewddur that it might be wiser to leave hen wen here until we can return for her i thought of that too answered taran its not that i dont trust eiddileg to keep his word most of the time but im not sure we should take another chance in that lake and i doubt we could find another way into his kingdom he certainly wont make it easy for us to come back im afraid no we must take hen wen while we have the chance once shes with me again i wont let her out of my sight suddenly the fair folk halted at one of the cottages and from a neatly carpentered pen taran heard a loud hwoinch he raced to the sty hen wen was standing with her front feet on the rails grunting at the top of her voice one of the fair folk opened the gate and the white pig burst out wriggling and squealing taran threw his arms around hen wens neck oh hen he cried even medwyn thought you were dead hwch hwaaw hen wen chuckled joyfully her beady eyes sparkled with her great pink snout she rooted affectionately under tarans chin and came close to knocking him down she looks like a wonderful pig eilonwy said scratching hen wen behind the ears its always nice to see two friends meet again its like waking up with the sun shining shes certainly a great deal of pig agreed the bard though very handsome i must say and clever noble brave wise gurgi found her have no fear taran said with a smile to gurgi theres no chance well forget it rolling and waddling on her short legs hen wen followed taran happily while the fair folk proceeded across the fields to where a stocky figure waited the captain of the troop announced that this was doli the guide eiddileg had promised doli short and stumpy almost as broad as he was tall wore a rustcolored leather jacket and stout kneehigh boots a round cap covered his head but not enough to conceal a fringe of flaming red hair an axe and short sword hung from his belt and over his shoulder he wore the stubby bow of the fair folk warrior taran bowed politely the dwarf stared at him with a pair of bright red eyes and snorted then to tarans surprise doli took a deep breath and held it until his face turned scarlet and he looked about to burst after a few moments the dwarf puffed out his cheeks and snorted again whats the trouble asked taran you can still see me cant you doli burst out angrily of course i can still see you taran frowned why shouldnt i doli gave him a scornful look and did not answer two of the fair folk led up melyngar king eiddileg taran saw with relief was as good as his word the saddlebags bulged with provisions and the white mare also carried a number of spears bows and arrows short and heavy as were all the weapons of the fair folk but carefully and sturdily crafted without another word doli beckoned them to follow him across the meadow grumbling and muttering to himself the dwarf led them to what seemed to be the sheer face of a cliff only after he had reached it did taran see long flights of steps carved into the living rock doli jerked his head toward the stairway and they began to climb this passageway of the fair folk was steeper than any of the mountains they had crossed melyngar strained forward wheezing and gasping hen wen pulled herself up each step the stairway turned and twisted at one point the darkness was such that the companions lost sight of each other after a time the steps broke off and the group trod a narrow pathway of hardpacked stones sheets of white light rippled ahead and the travelers found themselves behind a high waterfall one after the other they leaped the glistening rocks splashed through a foaming stream and at last emerged into the cool air of the hills doli squinted up at the sun not much daylight left he muttered more gruffly than king eiddileg himself dont think im going to walk my legs off all night either didnt ask for this work you know got picked for it guiding a crew of of what an assistant pigkeeper a yellowheaded idiot with a harp a girl with a sword a shaggy whatisit not to mention the livestock all you can hope for is you dont run into a real war band theyd do for you they would theres not one of you looks as if he could handle a blade humph this was the most doli had spoken since they had left eiddilegs realm and despite the dwarfs uncomplimentary opinions taran hoped he would finally come around to being civil doli however had said all he intended to say for a while later when taran ventured to speak to him the dwarf turned angrily away and started holding his breath again for goodness sake eilonwy cried i wish youd stop that it makes me feel as if id drunk too much water just watching you it still doesnt work doli growled whatever are you trying to do taran asked even hen wen stared curiously at the dwarf what does it look like doli answered im trying to make myself invisible thats an odd thing to attempt remarked fflewddur im supposed to be invisible snapped doli my whole family can do it just like that like blowing out a candle but not me no wonder they all laugh at me no wonder eiddileg sends me out with a pack of fools if theres anything nasty or disagreeable to be done its always find good old doli if theres gems to be cut or blades to be decorated or arrows to be footed thats the job for good old doli the dwarf held his breath again this time so long that his face turned blue and his ears trembled i think youre getting it now said the bard with an encouraging smile i cant see you at all no sooner had this remark passed his lips than a harp string snapped in two fflewddur looked sorrowfully at the instrument blast the thing he muttered i knew i was exaggerating somewhat i only did it to make him feel better he actually did seem to be fading a bit around the edges if i could carve gems and do all those other things taran remarked sympathetically to doli i wouldnt mind not being invisible all i know is vegetables and horseshoes and not too much about either its silly eilonwy added to worry because you cant do something you simply cant do thats worse than trying to make yourself taller by standing on your head none of these wellintentioned remarks cheered the dwarf who strode angrily ahead swinging his axe from side to side despite his bad temper doli was an excellent guide taran realized most of the time the dwarf said little beyond his usual grunts and snorts making no attempt to explain the path he followed or to suggest how long it would take the companions to reach caer dathyl taran nevertheless had learned a great deal of woodcraft and tracking during his journey and he was aware the companions had begun turning westward to descend the hills they had during the afternoon covered more ground than taran thought possible and he knew it was thanks to dolis expert guidance when he congratulated the dwarf doli answered only humph and held his breath they camped that night on the sheltered slope of the last barrier of mountains gurgi whom taran had taught to build a fire was delighted to be useful he cheerfully gathered twigs dug a cooking pit and to the surprise of all distributed the provisions equally without saving out a private share for his own crunchings and munchings later on doli refused to do anything whatsoever he took his own food from a large leather wallet hanging at his side and sat on a rock chewing glumly he snorted with annoyance between every mouthful and occasionally held his breath keep at it old boy called fflewddur another try might do it your outline looks definitely blurred oh hush eilonwy told the bard dont encourage him or hell decide to hold his breath forever just lending support explained the crestfallen bard a fflam never gives up and i dont see why a dwarf should hen wen had not left tarans side all day now as he spread his cloak on the ground the white pig grunted with pleasure waddled over and hunkered down beside him her crinkled ears relaxed she thrust her snout comfortably against tarans shoulder and chuckled contentedly a blissful smile on her face soon the whole weight of her head pressed on him making it impossible for taran to roll onto his side hen wen snored luxuriously and taran resigned himself to sleeping despite the assortment of whistles and groans directly below his ear im glad to see you hen he said and im glad youre glad to see me but i wish you wouldnt be so loud about it next morning they turned their backs on the eagle mountains and began heading for what taran hoped would be caer dathyl as the trees rose more densely around them taran turned for a last glimpse of the eagle itself tall and serene in the distance he was grateful their path had not led them over it but in his heart he hoped one day to return and climb its towers of sunflecked ice and black stone until this journey he had never seen mountains but now he understood why gwydion had spoken longingly of caer dathyl his thought led taran to wonder again what else gwydion had expected to learn from hen wen when they halted he spoke to fflewddur about it there may be someone in caer dathyl who can understand her taran said but if we could only get her to prophesy now she might tell us something important the bard agreed however as taran had pointed out they had no letter sticks i could try a new spell offered eilonwy achren taught me some others but i dont know if theyd be any use they havent anything to do with oracular pigs i do know a wonderful one for summoning toads achren was about to teach me the spell for opening locks but i dont suppose ill ever learn it now even so locks havent much to do with pigs either eilonwy knelt beside hen wen and whispered rapidly hen wen seemed to listen politely for a while grinning broadly wheezing and snuffling she gave no sign of understanding a word of what the girl was saying and at last with a joyful hwoinch she broke away and ran to taran wriggling gleefully its no use taran said and theres no sense in losing time i hope they have letter sticks in caer dathyl though i doubt it whatever dallben has it seems to be the only one of its kind in all prydain they resumed their march gurgi now official cook and firemaker strode boldly behind the dwarf doli led the companions through a clearing and past a line of alders a few moments later the dwarf halted and cocked his head taran heard the sound too a faint highpitched screaming it seemed to come from a twisted thornbush drawing his sword taran hurried past the dwarf at first he could see nothing in the dark tangle he drew closer then stopped abruptly it was a gwythaint chapter the fledgling the gwythaint hung like a crumpled black rag one wing upraised the other folded awkwardly on its breast no larger than a raven it was young and barely out of its first moult the head seemed a little too big for its body the feathers thin and quilly as taran cautiously approached the gwythaint fluttered vainly unable to free itself the bird opened its curved beak and hissed warningly but its eyes were dull and halfclosed the companions had followed taran as soon as gurgi saw what it was he hunched up his shoulders and with many fearful glances behind him turned and crept off to a safe distance melyngar whinnied nervously the white pig undisturbed sat on her haunches and looked cheerful fflewddur on seeing the bird gave a low whistle its a stroke of luck the parents arent about he said those creatures will tear a man to shreds if their young are in danger it reminds me of achren eilonwy said especially around the eyes on days when she was in a bad temper doli pulled his axe from his belt what are you going to do taran asked the dwarf looked at him with surprise going to do do you have any other stupid questions you cant imagine id let it sit there can you im going to chop off its head to begin with no cried taran seizing the dwarfs arm its badly hurt be glad of that snapped doli if it werent neither you nor i nor any of us would be standing here i will not have it killed taran declared its in pain and it needs help thats true eilonwy said it doesnt look comfortable at all for the matter of that it looks even worse than achren the dwarf threw his axe to the ground and put his hands on his hips i cant make myself invisible he snorted but at least im no fool go ahead pick up the vicious little thing give it a drink pat its head then youll see what happens as soon as its got strength enough the first thing itll do is slice you to bits and next thing fly straight to arawn then well be in a fine stew what doli says is true fflewddur added i myself dont enjoy chopping things up the bird is interesting in a disagreeable sort of way but weve been lucky so far with no trouble from gwythaints at least i dont see the use of bringing one of arawns spies right into our bosom as you might say a fflam is always kindhearted but it seems to me this is overdoing it medwyn would not say so taran answered in the hills he spoke of kindness for all creatures and he told me much about the gwythaints i think its important to bring this one to caer dathyl no one has ever captured a live gwythaint as far as i know who can tell what value it may have the bard scratched his head well yes i suppose if it had any use at all it would be better alive than dead but the proposition is risky no matter what taran gestured for the others to stand away from the bush he saw the gwythaint was wounded by more than thorns perhaps an eagle had challenged it for blood flecked its back and a number of feathers had been torn out he reached in carefully the gwythaint hissed again and a long rasping rattle sounded in its throat taran feared the bird might be dying even then he put a hand under its feverish body the gwythaint struck with beak and talons but its strength had gone taran lifted it free of the thornbush if i can find the right herbs ill make a poultice taran told eilonwy but ill need hot water to steep them while the girl prepared a nest of grass and leaves taran asked gurgi to build a fire and heat some stones which could be dropped into a cup of water then with hen wen at his heels he quickly set out to search for the plants how long are we going to stay here doli shouted after him not that i care youre the ones in a hurry not i humph he thrust his axe into his belt jammed his cap tight on his head and furiously held his breath taran was again grateful for what coll had taught him of herbs he found most of what he needed growing nearby hen wen joined the hunt with enthusiasm grunting happily rooting under leaves and stones indeed the white pig was the first to discover an important variety taran had overlooked the gwythaint did not struggle when taran applied the poultice soaking a piece of cloth torn from his jacket in another healing brew he squeezed the liquid drop by drop into the birds beak thats all very well said doli whose curiosity had got the better of him and who had come to observe the operation how do you imagine youll carry the nasty thing perched on your shoulder i dont know taran said i thought i could wrap it in my cloak doli snorted thats the trouble with you great clodhoppers you dont see beyond your noses but if you expect me to build a cage for you youre mistaken a cage would be just the thing taran agreed no i wouldnt want to bother you with that ill try to make one myself the dwarf watched contemptuously while taran gathered saplings and attempted to weave them together oh stop it doli finally burst out i cant stand looking at botched work here get out of the way he shouldered taran aside squatted on the ground and picked up the saplings he trimmed them expertly with his knife lashed them with braided vines and in no time at all the dwarf held up a serviceable cage thats certainly more practical than making yourself invisible eilonwy said the dwarf made no answer and only looked at her angrily taran lined the bottom of the cage with leaves gently put the gwythaint inside and they resumed their march doli now led them at a faster pace to make up for the time they had lost he tramped steadily down the hill slopes without even turning to see whether taran and the others were able to keep up with him the speed of their pace taran realized served little purpose since they were obliged to halt more frequently but he did not deem it wise to mention this to the dwarf throughout the day the gwythaint steadily improved at each halt taran fed the bird and applied the medicines gurgi was still too terrified to come near taran alone dared handle the creature when fflewddur endeavoring to make friends put his finger into the cage the gwythaint roused and slashed at him with its beak i warn you snapped doli no good will come of this but dont pay any attention to what i say go right ahead cut your own throats then come running and complaining afterward im just a guide i do what im ordered to and thats all at nightfall they made camp and discussed plans for the morrow the gwythaint had entirely recovered and had also developed an enormous appetite it squawked furiously when taran did not bring its food quickly enough and rattled its beak against the cage it gobbled up the morsels taran gave it then looked around for more after eating the gwythaint crouched at the bottom of the cage its head cocked and listening its eyes following every movement taran finally ventured to put a finger past the bars and scratch the gwythaints head the creature no longer hissed and it made no attempt to bite him the gwythaint even allowed eilonwy to feed it but the bards attempts to make friends failed it knows perfectly well youd have agreed to chop off its head eilonwy told fflewddur so you cant blame the poor thing for being annoyed at you if somebody wanted to chop off my head then came around afterward and wanted to be sociable id peck at them too gwydion told me the birds are trained when young taran said i wish he were here he would know best how to handle the creature perhaps it could be taught differently but theres bound to be a good falconer at caer dathyl and well see what he can do but the next morning the cage was empty doli who had risen long before the others was the first to discover it the furious dwarf thrust the cage under tarans nose the sapling bars had been slashed to pieces by the gwythaints beak and there you have it cried doli i told you so dont say i didnt warn you the treacherous creatures halfway to annuvin by now after listening to every word we said if arawn didnt know where we are hell know soon enough youve done well oh very well doli snorted spare me from fools and assistant pigkeepers taran could not hide his disappointment or fear fflewddur said nothing but the bards face was grim ive done the wrong thing again as usual taran said angrily doli is right theres no difference between a fool and an assistant pigkeeper thats probably true agreed eilonwy whose remark did nothing to cheer taran but she went on i cant stand people who say i told you so thats worse than somebody coming up and eating your dinner before you have a chance to sit down even so she added doli means well hes not half as disagreeable as he pretends to be and im sure hes worried about us hes like a porcupine all prickly on the outside but very ticklish once you turn him over if hed only stop trying to make himself invisible i think it should do a lot to improve his disposition there was no time for further regrets doli set them an even swifter pace they still followed the hills along the ystrad valley but at midday the dwarf turned west and once more began to descend toward the plains the sky had grown as thick and gray as lead violent gusts of wind whipped at their faces the pale sun gave no warmth melyngar neighed uneasily hen wen placid and agreeable until now began to roll her eyes and mutter to herself while the companions rested briefly doli went ahead to scout the land in a short time he was back again he led them to the crest of a hill motioned them to stay close to the ground and pointed toward the ystrad below the plain was covered with warriors on foot and on horseback black banners snapped in the wind even at this distance taran could hear the clank of weapons the steady heavy drumming of marching feet at the head of the winding columns rode the horned king the giant figure towered above the menatarms who galloped behind him the curving antlers rose like eager claws as taran watched terrified but unable to turn away the horned kings head swung slowly in the direction of the heights taran pressed flat against the earth arawns champion he was sure could not see him it was only a trick of his mind a mirror of his own fear but it seemed the horned kings eyes sought him out and thrust like daggers at his heart they have overtaken us taran said in a flat voice hurry snapped the dwarf get hustling instead of dawdling and moaning were no more than a day away from caer dathyl and so are they we can still move faster if you hadnt stopped for that ungrateful spy of annuvin wed be well ahead of them by now dont say i didnt warn you we should arm ourselves a little better the bard said the horned king will have outriders on both sides of the valley taran unstrapped the weapons on melyngars back and handed a bow and quiver of arrows to his companions as well as a short spear for each king eiddileg had given them round bronze bucklers they were dwarfsize and after his view of the marching hosts taran found them pitifully small gurgi buckled a short sword around his waist of all the band he was the most excited yes yes he cried now bold valiant gurgi is a mighty warrior too he has a grinding gasher and a pointed piercer he is ready for great fightings and smitings and so am i fflewddur declared nothing withstands the onslaught of an angry fflam the dwarf clapped his hands to his head and gnashed his teeth stop jabbering and move he sputtered this time he was too furious to hold his breath taran slung the buckler over his shoulder hen wen hung back and grunted fearfully i know youre afraid taran whispered coaxingly but youll be safe in caer dathyl the pig followed reluctantly but as doli set off once again she lagged behind and it was all taran could do to urge her forward her pink snout trembled her eyes darted from one side of the path to the other at the next halt doli summoned taran keep on like this he cried and youll have no chance at all first a gwythaint delays us now a pig shes frightened taran tried to explain to the angry dwarf she knows the horned king is near then tie her up doli said put her on the horse taran nodded yes she wont like it but theres nothing else we can do a few moments before the pig had been crouched at the roots of a tree now there was no sign of her hen taran called he turned to the bard where did she go he asked in alarm the bard shook his head neither he nor eilonwy had seen her move gurgi had been watering melyngar and had not noticed the pig at all she cant have run off again taran cried he raced back into the woods when he returned his face was pale shes gone he gasped shes hiding somewhere i know it he sank to the ground and put his head in his hands i shouldnt have let her out of my sight not even for a moment he said bitterly i have failed twice let the others go on eilonwy said well find her and catch up with them before taran could answer he heard a sound that chilled his blood from the hills came the voices of a hunting pack in full cry and the long notes of a horn the companions stood frozen with dread with the ice of terror in his throat taran looked at the silent faces around him the dire music trembled in the air a shadow flickered across the lowering sky where gwyn the hunter rides murmured fflewddur death rides close behind chapter the flame of dyrnwyn no sooner had the notes of gwyns horn sunk into the hills than taran started as though waking from a fearful dream hoofbeats drummed across the meadow the homed kings scouts cried fflewddur pointing to the mounted warriors galloping toward them theyve seen us up from the plains the riders sped bent over their saddles urging on their steeds they drew closer lances leveled as if each gleaming point sought its own target i could try to make another web eilonwy suggested then added but im afraid the last one wasnt too useful tarans sword flashed out there are only four of them he said we match them in numbers at least put up your blade fflewddur said arrows first well have work enough for swords later they unslung their bows under fflewddurs orders they formed a line and knelt shoulder to shoulder the bards spiky yellow hair blew in the wind his face shone with excitement i havent had a good fight in years he said thats one of the things i miss being a bard theyll see what it means to attack a fflam taran nocked an arrow to the string at a word from the bard the companions drew their bows and took aim loose shouted fflewddur taran saw his own shaft fly wide of the leading horseman with a cry of anger he seized another arrow from the quiver beside him he heard gurgi shout triumphantly of the volley only gurgis bolt had found its mark a warrior toppled from his home the shaft deep in his throat they know we can sting fflewddur cried loose again the horsemen veered more cautious now the warriors raised their bucklers of the three two drove directly for the companions the third turned his mounts head and galloped to the flank of the defenders now friends shouted the bard back to back taran heard doli grunt as the dwarf loosed an arrow at the nearest warrior gurgis shot had been lucky now the shafts hissed through the air only to glance off the attackers light shields behind taran melyngar whinnied and pawed the ground frantically taran remembered how valiantly she had fought for gwydion but she was tethered now and he dared not break away from the defenders to untie her the horsemen circled one turned his exposed side to the companions dolis arrow leaped from the bowstring and buried itself in the warriors neck the other horsemen spun their mounts and galloped across the meadow weve beaten them cried eilonwy thats like bees driving away eagles the panting fflewddur shook his head theyll spend no more men on us when they come back theyll come back with a war band thats highly complimentary to our bravery but i dont think we should wait for them a fflam knows when to fight and when to run at this point we had better run i wont leave hen wen cried taran go look for her growled doli youll lose your head as well as your pig crafty gurgi will go suggested gurgi with bold seekings and peekings in all likelihood said the bard theyll attack us again we cant afford to lose what little strength we have a fflam never worries about being outnumbered but one sword less could be fatal im sure your pig is able to look out for herself wherever she may be she is in less danger than we are taran nodded it is true but it grieves me to lose her for the second time i had chosen to abandon my search and go to caer dathyl then after gurgi found hen wen i had hoped to accomplish both tasks but i fear it must be one or the other the question is said fflewddur is there any chance at all of warning the sons of don before the horned king attacks doli is the only one who can answer that the dwarf scowled and thought for a few moments possible he said but well have to go into the valley well be in the middle of the horned kings vanguard if we do can we get through asked taran wont know until youve tried grunted doli the decision is yours said the bard glancing at taran we shall try taran answered for the rest of that day they traveled without a halt at nightfall taran would have been glad to rest but the dwarf warned against it the companions pressed on in weary silence they had escaped the attack fflewddur expected but a column of horsemen bearing torches passed within bowshot of them the companions crouched in the fringe of trees until the streaks of flame wound behind a hill and vanished in a short time doli led the little band into the valley where they found concealment in the wooded groves but the dawn revealed a sight that filled taran with despair the valley roiled with warriors wherever he turned his eyes black banners whipped against the sky the host of the horned king was like the body of an armed giant restlessly stirring for a moment taran stared in disbelief he turned his face away too late he murmured too late we have failed while the dwarf surveyed the marching columns fflewddur strode forward there is one thing we can do he cried caer dathyl lies straight ahead let us go on and make our last stand there taran nodded yes my place is at the side of gwydions people doli shall lead gurgi and eilonwy to safety he took a deep breath and buckled his sword belt more tightly you have guided us well he said quietly to the dwarf return to your king with our gratitude your work is done the dwarf looked at him furiously done he snorted idiots and numbskulls its not that i care what happens to you but dont think im going to watch you get hacked to pieces i cant stand a botched job like it or not im going with you before the words were out of his mouth an arrow sang past dolis head melyngar reared up a party of foot soldiers sprang from the woods behind the companions begone the bard shouted to taran ride as fast as you can or it will be death for all of us when taran hesitated the bard seized him by the shoulders pitched him toward the horse and thrust eilonwy after him fflewddur drew his sword do as i say shouted the bard his eyes blazing taran leaped to melyngars saddle and pulled eilonwy up behind him the white horse shot forward eilonwy clung to tarans waist as the steed galloped straight across the bracken toward the vanguard of the horned king taran made no attempt to guide her the horse had chosen her own path suddenly he was in the midst of the warriors melyngar reared and plunged tarans sword was out and he struck right and left a hand clutched at the stirrups then was ripped away taran saw the warrior stumble back and drown in the press of struggling men the white horse broke free and streaked for the brow of the hill one mounted figure galloped behind them now in a terrified glance taran saw the sweeping antlers of the horned king the black steed gained on them melyngar turned sharply and drove toward the forest the horned king turned with her and as they crashed through the underbrush and past the first rows of trees the antlered giant drew closer until both steeds galloped side by side in a final burst of speed the horse of the horned king plunged ahead the animals flanks bore against melyngar who reared furiously and struck out with her hoofs taran and eilonwy were flung from the saddle the horned king turned his mount seeking to trample them taran scrambled to his feet and struck blindly with his sword then gripping eilonwys arm he pulled her deeper into the protection of the trees the horned king sprang heavily to the ground and was upon them in a few long strides eilonwy screamed taran swung about to face the antlered man dark fears clutched taran as though the lord of annuvin himself had opened an abyss at his feet and he was hurtling downward he gasped with pain as though his old wound had opened once again all the despair he had known as achrens captive returned to sap his strength behind the bleached skull the eyes of the horned king flamed as he raised a crimsonstained arm blindly taran brought up his sword it trembled in his hand the horned kings blade lashed against the weapon and shattered it with a single blow taran dropped the useless shards the horned king paused a growl of savage joy rose in his throat and he took a firmer grasp on his weapon mortal terror goaded taran into action he leaped back and spun toward eilonwy dyrnwyn he cried give me the sword before she could move he tore belt and weapon from her shoulder the horned king saw the black scabbard and hesitated a moment as if in fear taran grasped the hilt the blade would not come free he pulled with all his strength the sword moved only a little from its sheath the horned king raised his own weapon as taran gave a final wrench the scabbard turned in his hand a blinding flash split the air in front of him lightning seared his arm and he was thrown violently to the ground the sword dyrnwyn blazing white with flame leaped from his hand and fell beyond his reach the horned king stood over him with a cry eilonwy sprang at the antlered man snarling the giant tossed her aside a voice rang out behind the horned king through eyes blurred with pain taran glimpsed a tall figure against the trees and heard a shouted word he could not distinguish the horned king stood motionless his arm upraised lightning played about his sword the giant flamed like a burning tree the stag horns turned to crimson streaks the skull mask ran like molten iron a roar of pain and rage rose from the antlered kings throat with a cry taran flung an arm across his face the ground rumbled and seemed to open beneath him then there was nothing chapter the secret sunlight streamed through the high window of a chamber pleasantly cool and fragrant taran blinked and tried to lift himself from the low narrow couch his head spun his arm swathed in white linen throbbed painfully dry rushes covered the floor the bright rays turned them yellow as wheat beside the couch a white sundappled shape stirred and rose up hwoinch hen wen wheezing and chuckling grinned all over her round face with a joyful grunt she began nuzzling tarans cheek his mouth opened but he could not speak a silvery laugh rang from a comer of the chamber you should really see your expression you look like a fish thats climbed into a birds nest by mistake eilonwy rose from the osier stool i was hoping youd wake up soon you cant imagine how boring it is to sit and watch somebody sleep its like counting stones in a wall where have they taken us is this annuvin eilonwy laughed again and shook her head thats exactly the sort of question you might expect from an assistant pigkeeper annuvin ugh i wouldnt want to be there at all why must you always think of unpleasant things i suppose its because your wound probably did something to your head youre looking a lot better now than you did though you still have that greenishwhite color like a boiled leek stop chattering and tell me where we are taran tried to roll from the couch then sank back weakly and put a hand to his head you arent supposed to get up yet eilonwy cautioned but i imagine youve just discovered that for yourself wriggling and grunting loudly the delighted hen wen had begun to climb onto the couch eilonwy snapped her fingers stop that hen she ordered you know he isnt to be disturbed or upset and especially not sat on the girl turned again to taran were in caer dathyl she said its a lovely place much nicer than spiral castle taran started up once more as memories flooded over him the horned king he cried what happened where is he in a barrow most likely i should think is he dead naturally answered the girl you dont think hed stand being put in a barrow if he werent do you there wasnt a great deal left of him but what there was got buried eilonwy shuddered i think he was the most terrifying person ive ever met and that includes achren he gave me a dreadful tossing about just before he was going to smite you she rubbed her head for the matter of that you pulled away my sword rather roughly i told you and told you not to draw it but you wouldnt listen thats what burned your arm taran noticed the black scabbard of dyrnwyn no longer hung from eilonwys shoulder but then what its lucky you went unconscious eilonwy continued you missed the worst of it there was the earthquake and the horned king burning until he just well broke apart it wasnt pleasant the truth of the matter is id rather not talk about it it still gives me bad dreams even when im not asleep taran gritted his teeth eilonwy he said at last i want you to tell me very slowly and carefully what happened if you dont im going to be angry and youre going to be sorry how can i tell you anything eilonwy said deliberately pronouncing every word and making extravagant grimaces as she did so if you dont want me to talk she shrugged well in any case she resumed at her usual breathless rate as soon as the armies saw the horned king was dead they practically fell apart too not the same way naturally with them it was more sort of running away like a herd of rabbits no that isnt right is it but it was pitiful to see grown men so frightened of course by that time the sons of don had their chance to attack you should have seen the golden banners and such handsome warriors eilonwy sighed it was it was like i dont even know what it was like and hen wen she hasnt stirred from this chamber ever since they brought you here said eilonwy neither have i she added with a glance at taran shes a very intelligent pig eilonwy went on oh she does get frightened and loses her head once in a while i suppose and she can be very stubborn when she wants which sometimes makes me wonder how much difference there is between pigs and the people who keep them im not mentioning anyone in particular you understand the door opposite tarans couch opened part way around it appeared the spiky yellow head and pointed nose of fflewddur fflam so youre back with us cried the bard or as you might say were back with you gurgi and the dwarf who had been standing behind the bard now rushed in despite eilonwys protests they crowded around taran fflewddur and doli showed no sign of injury but gurgis head was bound up and he moved with a limp yes yes he cried gurgi fought for his friend with slashings and gashings what smitings fierce warriors strike him about his poor tender head but valiant gurgi does not flee oh no taran smiled at him deeply touched im sorry about your poor tender head he said putting a hand on gurgis shoulder and that a friend should be wounded for my sake what joy what clashings and smashings ferocious gurgi fills wicked warriors with awful terror and outcries its true said the bard he was the bravest of us all though my stumpy friend here can do surprising things with an axe doli for the first time grinned never thought any of you had any mettle to show he said attempting to be gruff took you all for milksops at first deepest apologies he added with a bow we held off the war band fflewddur said until we were sure you were well away some of them should have occasion to think unkindly of us for a while to come the bards face lit up there we were he cried fighting like madmen hopelessly outnumbered but a fflam never surrenders i took on three at once slash thrust another seized me from behind the wretched coward but i flung him off we disengaged them and made for caer dathyl chopping and hacking all the way beset on all sides taran expected fflewddurs harp strings to sunder at any moment to his surprise they held firm and so fflewddur concluded with a carefree shrug that was our part rather easy when you come down to it i had no fear of things going badly not for an instant a string broke with a deep twang fflewddur bent down to taran terrified he whispered absolutely green eilonwy seized the bard and thrust him toward the door begone she cried all of you youll wear him out with your chatter the girl shoved gurgi and the dwarf after fflewddur and stay out no ones to come in until i say they can not even i taran started up at the familiar voice gwydion stood in the doorway for a moment taran did not recognize him instead of the stained cloak and coarse jacket gwydion wore the shining raiment of a prince his rich mantle hung in deep folds on a chain at his throat gleamed a sunshaped disk of gold his green eyes shone with new depth and power taran saw him now as he had always imagined him heedless of his wounded arm taran sprang from the couch the tall figure strode toward him the authority of the warriors bearing made taran drop to one knee lord gwydion he murmured that is no greeting from a friend to a friend said gwydion gently raising taran to his feet it gives me more pleasure to remember an assistant pigkeeper who feared i would poison him in the forest near caer dallben after spiral castle taran stammered i never thought to see you alive he clasped gwydions hand and wept unashamedly a little more alive than you are gwydion smiled he helped taran seat himself on the couch but how did taran began as he noticed a black and battered weapon at gwydions side gwydion saw the question on tarans face a gift he said a royal gift from a young lady i girded it on him myself eilonwy interrupted she turned to gwydion i told him not to draw it but hes impossibly stubborn fortunately you did not unsheath it entirely gwydion said to taran i fear the flame of dyrnwyn would have been too great even for an assistant pigkeeper it is a weapon of power as eilonwy recognized gwydion added so ancient that i believed it no more than a legend there are still deep secrets concerning dyrnwyn unknown even to the wisest its loss destroyed spiral castle and was a severe blow to arawn with a single firm gesture gwydion drew the blade and held it aloft the weapon glittered blindingly in fear and wonder taran shrank back his wound throbbing anew gwydion quickly returned the blade to its scabbard as soon as i saw lord gwydion eilonwy put in with an admiring glance at him i knew he was the one who should keep the sword i must say im glad to have done with the clumsy thing do stop interrupting taran cried let me find out what happened to my friend before you start babbling i shall not weary you with a long tale gwydion said you already know arawns threat has been turned aside he may strike again how or when no man can guess but for the moment there is little to fear what of achren taran asked and spiral castle i was not in spiral castle when it crumbled gwydion said achren took me from my cell and bound me to a horse with the cauldronborn we rode to the castle of oethanoeth oethanoeth questioned taran it is a stronghold of annuvin gwydion said not far from spiral castle raised when arawn held wider sway over prydain a place of death its walls are filled with human bones i could foresee the torments achren had planned for me yet before she thrust me into its dungeons she gripped my arm why do you choose death lord gwydion she cried when i can offer you eternal life and power beyond the grasp of mortal minds i ruled prydain long before arawn achren told me and it was i who made him king over annuvin it was i who gave him power though he used it to betray me but now if you desire it you shall take your place on the high throne of arawn himself and rule in his stead gladly will i overthrow arawn i answered and i will use those powers to destroy you along with him raging she cast me into the lowest dungeon gwydion said i have never been closer to my death than in oeth anoeth how long i lay there i can not be sure gwydion continued in oethanoeth time is not as you know it here it is better that i do not speak of the torments achren had devised the worst were not of the body but of the spirit and of these the most painful was despair yet even in my deepest anguish i clung to hope for there is this about oethanoeth if a man withstand it even death will give up its secrets to him i withstood it gwydion said quietly and at the end much was revealed to me which before had been clouded of this too i shall not speak it is enough for you to know that i understood the workings of life and death of laughter and tears endings and beginnings i saw the truth of the world and knew no chains could hold me my bonds were light as dreams at that moment the walls of my prison melted what became of achren eilonwy asked i do not know gwydion said i did not see her thereafter for some days i lay concealed in the forest to heal the injuries of my body spiral castle was in ruins when i returned to seek you and there i mourned your death as we mourned yours taran said i set out for caer dathyl again gwydion continued for a time i followed the same path fflewddur chose for you though i did not cross the valley until much later by then i had outdistanced you a little that day a gwythaint plunged from the sky and flew directly toward me to my surprise it neither attacked nor sped away after it had seen me but fluttered before me crying strangely the gwythaints language is no longer secret to me nor is the speech of any living creature and i understood a band of travelers was journeying from the hills nearby and a white pig accompanied them i hastened to retrace my steps by then hen wen sensed i was close at hand when she ran from you gwydion said to taran she ran not in terror but to find me what i learned from her was more important than i suspected and i understood why arawns champion sought her desperately he too realized she knew the one thing that could destroy him what was that taran asked urgently she knew the horned kings secret name his name taran cried in astonishment i never realized a name could be so powerful yes gwydion answered once you have courage to look upon evil seeing it for what it is and naming it by its true name it is powerless against you and you can destroy it yet with all my understanding he said reaching down and scratching the white pigs ear i could not have discovered the horned kings name without hen wen hen wen told me this secret in the forest i had no need of letter sticks or tomes of enchantment for we could speak as one heart and mind to another the gwythaint circling overhead led me to the horned king the rest you know where is the gwythaint now asked taran gwydion shook his head i do not know but i doubt she will ever return to annuvin for arawn would rend her to pieces once he learned what she had done i only know she has repaid your kindness in the fullest measure rest now gwydion said later we shall speak of happier things lord gwydion eilonwy called as he rose to leave what was the horned kings secret name gwydions lined face broke into a smile it must remain a secret he said then patted the girl gently on the cheek but i assure you it was not half as pretty as your own a few days afterwards when taran had regained strength enough to walk unaided gwydion accompanied him through caer dathyl standing high on a hill the fortress alone was big enough to hold several caer dallbens taran saw armorers shops stables for the steeds of warrior breweries weaving rooms cottages clustered in the valleys below and clear streams ran golden in the sunlight later gwydion summoned all the companions to the great hall of caer dathyl and there amid banners and hedges of spears they received the gratitude of king math son of mathonwy ruler of the house of don the whitebearded monarch who looked as old as dallben and as testy was even more talkative than eilonwy but when at last he had finished one of the longest speeches taran had ever heard the companions bowed and a guard of honor bore king math from the hall on a litter draped with cloth of gold as taran and his friends were about to take their leave gwydion called to them these are small gifts for great valor he said but it is in my power to bestow them which i do with a glad heart and with hope that you will treasure them not so much for their value as for the sake of remembrance to fflewddur fflam shall be given one harp string though all his others break this shall forever hold regardless of how many gallant extravagances he may put on it and its tone shall be the truest and most beautiful to doli of the fair folk shall be granted the power of invisibility so long as he choose to retain it to faithful and valiant gurgi shall be given a wallet of food which shall be always full guard it well it is one of the treasures of prydain to eilonwy of the house of llyr shall be given a ring of gold set with a gem carved by the ancient craftsmen of the fair folk it is precious but to me her friendship is even more precious and to taran of caer dallben here gwydion paused the choice of his reward has been the most difficult of all i ask no reward taran said i want no friend to repay me for what i did willingly out of friendship and for my own honor gwydion smiled taran of caer dallben he said you are still as touchy and headstrong as ever believe that i know what you yearn for in your heart the dreams of heroism of worth of achievement are noble ones but you not i must make them come true ask me whatever else and i shall grant it taran bowed his head in spite of all that has befallen me i have come to love the valleys and mountains of your northern lands but my thoughts have turned more and more to caer dallben i long to be home gwydion nodded so it shall be chapter welcomes the journey to caer dallben was swift and unhindered for the lords of the southern cantrevs their power broken had slunk back each to his own tribe throne taran and his companions with gwydion himself leading rode south through the valley of ystrad eilonwy who had heard so much of tarans talk of coll and dallben would not be denied a visit and she too rode with them gwydion had given each of the companions a handsome steed to taran he had given the finest the gray silvermaned stallion melynlas of the lineage of melyngar and as swift hen wen rode triumphantly on a horselitter looking intensely pleased with herself caer dallben had never seen so joyous a welcome though by this time taran was not positive about what dallben had or had not seen with such feasting that even gurgi had his fill for once coll embraced taran who was amazed that such a hero would deign to remember an assistant pigkeeper as well as eilonwy hen wen and anyone else he could get his hands on his face beamed like a winter fire and his bald crown glowed with delight dallben interrupted his meditations to be present at the feast though soon after the festivities he withdrew to his chamber and was not seen for some time later he and gwydion spent several hours alone for there were important matters gwydion would reveal only to the old enchanter gurgi making himself completely at home snored under a pile of hay in the barn while fflewddur and doli went off exploring taran showed eilonwy hen wens enclosure where the pig chuckled and grunted as happily as before so this is where it all began eilonwy said i dont want to sound critical but i dont think you should have had all that trouble keeping her in caer dallben is as lovely as you said and you should be glad to be home she went on its like suddenly remembering where you put something youve been looking for yes i suppose it is taran said leaning on the railing and examining it closely what will you do now asked eilonwy i expect youll go back to assistant pigkeeping without looking up taran nodded eilonwy he said with hesitation i was hoping i mean i was wondering before he could finish coll came hurrying up and whispered that dallben would like to see him privately eilonwy taran began again then stopped abruptly and strode off to the cottage when he entered the chamber dallben was writing with a great quill in the book of three as soon as he saw taran he shut the volume quickly and put it aside well now dallben said i should like the two of us to speak quietly to each other first i am interested to learn what you think of being a hero i daresay you feel rather proud of yourself although he added i do not gain that impression from your face i have no just cause for pride taran said taking his usual place on the familiar bench it was gwydion who destroyed the horned king and hen wen helped him do it but gurgi not i found her doli and fflewddur fought gloriously while i was wounded by a sword i had no right to draw and eilonwy was the one who took the sword from the barrow in the first place as for me what i mostly did was make mistakes my my said dallben those are complaints enough to dampen the merriest feast though what you say may be true you have cause for a certain pride nevertheless it was you who held the companions together and led them you did what you set out to do and hen wen is safely back with us if you made mistakes you recognize them as i told you there are times when the seeking counts more than the finding does it truly matter dallben went on which of you did what since all shared the same goal and the same danger nothing we do is ever done entirely alone there is a part of us in everyone else you of all people should know that from what i hear you have been as impetuous as your friend fflewddur i have been told among other things of a night when you dove head first into a thornbush and you have certainly felt as sorry for yourself as gurgi and like doli striven for the impossible yes admitted taran but that is not all that troubles me i have dreamed often of caer dallben and i love it and you and coll more than ever i asked for nothing better than to be at home and my heart rejoices yet it is a curious feeling i have returned to the chamber i slept in and found it smaller than i remember the fields are beautiful yet not quite as i recalled them and i am troubled for i wonder now if i am to be a stranger in my own home dallben shook his head no that you shall never be but it is not caer dallben which has grown smaller you have grown bigger that is the way of it and there is eilonwy taran said what will become of her is it is it possible you would let her stay with us dallben pursed his lips and toyed with the pages of the book of three by all rights he said the princess eilonwy should be returned to her kinsmen yes she is a princess did she not tell you but there is no hurry about that she might consent to stay perhaps if you spoke to her taran sprang to his feet i shall he hurried from the chamber and ran to hen wens enclosure eilonwy was still there watching the oracular pig with interest youre to stay taran cried ive asked dallben eilonwy tossed her head i suppose she said it never occurred to you to ask me yes but i mean he stammered i didnt think you usually dont eilonwy sighed no matter coll is straightening up a place for me already cried taran how did he know how did you know humph said eilonwy hwoinch said hen wen
