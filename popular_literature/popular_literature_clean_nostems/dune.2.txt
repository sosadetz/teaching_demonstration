dune messiah frank herbert excerpts from the death cell interview with bronso of ix q what led you to take your particular approach to a history of muaddib a why should i answer your questions q because i will preserve your words a ahhh the ultimate appeal to a historian q will you cooperate then a why not but youll never understand what inspired my analysis of history never you priests have too much at stake to q try me a try you well again why not i was caught by the shallowness of the common view of this planet which arises from its popular name dune not arrakis notice but dune history is obsessed by dune as desert as birthplace of the fremen such history concentrates on the customs which grew out of water scarcity and the fact that fremen led seminomadic lives in stillsuits which recovered most of their bodys moisture q are these things not true then a they are surface truth as well ignore what lies beneath that surface as as try to understand my birthplanet ix without exploring how we derived our name from the fact that we are the ninth planet of our sun no no it is not enough to see dune as a place of savage storms it is not enough to talk about the threat posed by the gigantic sandworms q but such things are crucial to the arrakeen character a crucial of course but they produce a oneview planet in the same way that dune is a onecrop planet because it is the sole and exclusive source of the spice melange q yes let us hear you expand on the sacred spice a sacred as with all things sacred it gives with one hand and takes with the other it extends life and allows the adept to foresee his future but it ties him to a cruel addiction and marks his eyes as yours are marked total blue without any white your eyes your organs of sight become one thing without contrast a single view q such heresy brought you to this cell a i was brought to this cell by your priests as with all priests you learned early to call the truth heresy q you are here because you dared to say that paul atreides lost something essential to his humanity before he could become muaddib a not to speak of his losing his father here in the harkonnen war nor the death of duncan idaho who sacrificed himself that paul and the lady jessica could escape q your cynicism is duly noted a cynicism that no doubt is a greater crime than heresy but you see im not really a cynic im just an observer and commentator i saw true nobility in paul as he fled into the desert with his pregnant mother of course she was a great asset as well as a burden q the flaw in your historians is that youll never leave well enough alone you see true nobility in the holy muaddib but you must append a cynical footnote its no wonder that the bene gesserit also denounce you a you priests do well to make common cause with the bene gesserit sisterhood they too survive by concealing what they do but they can not conceal the fact that the lady jessica was a bene gesserittrained adept you know she trained her son in the sisterhoods ways my crime was to discuss this as a phenomenon to expound upon their mental arts and their genetic program you dont want attention called to the fact that muaddib was the sisterhoods hoped for captive messiah that he was their kwisatz haderach before he was your prophet q if i had any doubts about your death sentence you have dispelled them a i can only die once q there are deaths and there are deaths a beware lest you make a martyr of me i do not think muaddib tell me does muaddib know what you do in these dungeons q we do not trouble the holy family with trivia a laughter and for this paul atreides fought his way to a niche among the fremen for this he learned to control and ride the sandworm it was a mistake to answer your questions q but i will keep my promise to preserve your words a will you really then listen to me carefully you fremen degenerate you priest with no god except yourself you have much to answer for it was a fremen ritual which gave paul his first massive dose of melange thereby opening him to visions of his futures it was a fremen ritual by which that same melange awakened the unborn alia in the lady jessicas womb have you considered what it meant for alia to be born into this universe fully cognitive possessed of all her mothers memories and knowledge no rape could be more terrifying q without the sacred melange muaddib would not have become leader of all fremen without her holy experience alia would not be alia a without your blind fremen cruelty you would not be a priest ahhh i know you fremen you think muaddib is yours because he mated with chani because he adopted fremen customs but he was an atreides first and he was trained by a bene gesserit adept he possessed disciplines totally unknown to you you thought he brought you new organization and a new mission he promised to transform your desert planet into a waterrich paradise and while he dazzled you with such visions he took your virginity q such heresy does not change the fact that the ecological transformation of dune proceeds apace a and i committed the heresy of tracing the roots of that transformation of exploring the consequences that battle out there on the plains of arrakeen may have taught the universe that fremen could defeat imperial sardaukar but what else did it teach when the stellar empire of the corrino family became a fremen empire under muaddib what else did the empire become your jihad only took twelve years but what a lesson it taught now the empire understands the sham of muaddibs marriage to the princess irulan q you dare accuse muaddib of sham a though you kill me for it its not heresy the princess became his consort not his mate chani his little fremen darling shes his mate everyone knows this irulan was the key to a throne nothing more q its easy to see why those who conspire against muaddib use your analysis of history as their rallying argument a ill not persuade you i know that but the argument of the conspiracy came before my analysis twelve years of muaddibs jihad created the argument thats what united the ancient power groups and ignited the conspiracy against muaddib such a rich store of myths enfolds paul muaddib the mentat emperor and his sister alia it is difficult to see the real persons behind these veils but there were after all a man born paul atreides and a woman born alia their flesh was subject to space and time and even though their oracular powers placed them beyond the usual limits of time and space they came from human stock they experienced real events which left real traces upon a real universe to understand them it must be seen that their catastrophe was the catastrophe of all mankind this work is dedicated then not to muaddib or his sister but to their heirs to all of us dedication in the muaddib concordance as copied from the tabla memorium of the mahdi spirit cult muaddibs imperial reign generated more historians than any other era in human history most of them argued a particular viewpoint jealous and sectarian but it says something about the peculiar impact of this man that he aroused such passions on so many diverse worlds of course he contained the ingredients of history ideal and idealized this man born paul atreides in an ancient great family received the deep pranabindu training from the lady jessica his bene gesserit mother and had through this a superb control over muscles and nerves but more than that he was a mentat an intellect whose capacities surpassed those of the religiously proscribed mechanical computers used by the ancients above all else muaddib was the kwisatz haderach which the sisterhoods breeding program had sought across thousands of generations the kwisatz haderach then the one who could be many places at once this prophet this man through whom the bene gesserit hoped to control human destiny this man became emperor muaddib and executed a marriage of convenience with a daughter of the padishah emperor he had defeated think on the paradox the failure implicit in this moment for you surely have read other histories and know the surface facts muaddibs wild fremen did indeed overwhelm the padishah shaddam iv they toppled the sardaukar legions the allied forces of the great houses the harkonnen armies and the mercenaries bought with money voted in the landsraad he brought the spacing guild to its knees and placed his own sister alia on the religious throne the bene gesserit had thought their own he did all these things and more muaddibs qizarate missionaries carried their religious war across space in a jihad whose major impetus endured only twelve standard years but in that time religious colonialism brought all but a fraction of the human universe under one rule he did this because capture of arrakis that planet known more often as dune gave him a monopoly over the ultimate coin of the realm the geriatric spice melange the poison that gave life here was another ingredient of ideal history a material whose psychic chemistry unraveled time without melange the sisterhoods reverend mothers could not perform their feats of observation and human control without melange the guilds steersmen could not navigate across space without melange billions upon billions of imperial citizens would die of addictive withdrawal without melange paulmuaddib could not prophesy we know this moment of supreme power contained failure there can be only one answer that completely accurate and total prediction is lethal other histories say muaddib was defeated by obvious plotters the guild the sisterhood and the scientific amoralists of the bene tleilex with their facedancer disguises other histories point out the spies in muaddibs household they make much of the dune tarot which clouded muaddibs powers of prophecy some show how muaddib was made to accept the services of a ghola the flesh brought back from the dead and trained to destroy him but certainly they must know this ghola was duncan idaho the atreides lieutenant who perished saving the life of the young paul yet they delineate the qizarate cabal guided by korba the panegyrist they take us step by step through korbas plan to make a martyr of muaddib and place the blame on chani the fremen concubine how can any of this explain the facts as history has revealed them they can not only through the lethal nature of prophecy can we understand the failure of such enormous and farseeing power hopefully other historians will learn something from this revelation analysis of history muaddib by bronso of ix there exists no separation between gods and men one blends softly casual into the other proverbs of muaddib despite the murderous nature of the plot he hoped to devise the thoughts of scytale the tleilaxu face dancer returned again and again to rueful compassion i shall regret causing death and misery to muaddib he told himself he kept this benignity carefully hidden from his fellow conspirators such feelings told him though that he found it easier to identify with the victim than with the attackers a thing characteristic of the tleilaxu scytale stood in bemused silence somewhat apart from the others the argument about psychic poison had been going on for some time now it was energetic and vehement but polite in that blindly compulsive way adepts of the great schools always adopted for matters close to their dogma when you think you have him skewered right then youll find him unwounded that was the old reverend mother of the bene gesserit gaius helen mohiam their hostess here on wallach ix she was a blackrobed stick figure a witch crone seated in a floater chair at scytales left her aba hood had been thrown back to expose a leathery face beneath silver hair deeply pocketed eyes stared out of skullmask features they were using a mirabhasa language honed phalange consonants and joined vowels it was an instrument for conveying fine emotional subtleties edric the guild steersman replied to the reverend mother now with a vocal curtsy contained in a sneer a lovely touch of disdainful politeness scytale looked at the guild envoy edric swam in a container of orange gas only a few paces away his container sat in the center of the transparent dome which the bene gesserit had built for this meeting the guildsman was an elongated figure vaguely humanoid with finned feet and hugely fanned membranous hands a fish in a strange sea his tanks vents emitted a pale orange cloud rich with the smell of the geriatric spice melange if we go on this way well die of stupidity that was the fourth person present the potential member of the conspiracy princess irulan wife but not mate scytale reminded himself of their mutual foe she stood at a corner of edrics tank a tall blond beauty splendid in a robe of blue whale fur and matching hat gold buttons glittered at her ears she carried herself with an aristocrats hauteur but something in the absorbed smoothness of her features betrayed the controls of her bene gesserit background scytales mind turned from nuances of language and faces to nuances of location all around the dome lay hills mangy with melting snow which reflected mottled wet blueness from the small bluewhite sun hanging at the meridian why this particular place scytale wondered the bene gesserit seldom did anything casually take the domes open plan a more conventional and confining space mightve inflicted the guildsman with claustrophobic nervousness inhibitions in his psyche were those of birth and life offplanet in open space to have built this place especially for edric though what a sharp finger that pointed at his weakness what here scytale wondered was aimed at me have you nothing to say for yourself scytale the reverend mother demanded you wish to draw me into this fools fight scytale asked very well were dealing with a potential messiah you dont launch a frontal attack upon such a one martyrdom would defeat us they all stared at him you think thats the only danger the reverend mother demanded voice wheezing scytale shrugged he had chosen a bland roundfaced appearance for this meeting jolly features and vapid full lips the body of a bloated dumpling it occurred to him now as he studied his fellow conspirators that he had made an ideal choice out of instinct perhaps he alone in this group could manipulate fleshly appearance across a wide spectrum of bodily shapes and features he was the human chameleon a face dancer and the shape he wore now invited others to judge him too lightly well the reverend mother pressed i was enjoying the silence scytale said our hostilities are better left unvoiced the reverend mother drew back and scytale saw her reassessing him they were all products of profound pranabindu training capable of muscle and nerve control that few humans ever achieved but scytale a face dancer had muscles and nerve linkages the others didnt even possess plus a special quality of sympatico a mimics insight with which he could put on the psyche of another as well as the others appearance scytale gave her enough time to complete the reassessment said poison he uttered the word with the atonals which said he alone understood its secret meaning the guildsman stirred and his voice rolled from the glittering speaker globe which orbited a corner of his tank above irulan were discussing psychic poison not a physical one scytale laughed mirabhasa laughter could flay an opponent and he held nothing back now irulan smiled in appreciation but the corners of the reverend mothers eyes revealed a faint hint of anger stop that mohiam rasped scytale stopped but he had their attention now edric in a silent rage the reverend mother alert in her anger irulan amused but puzzled our friend edric suggests scytale said that a pair of bene gesserit witches trained in all their subtle ways have not learned the true uses of deception mohiam turned to stare out at the cold hills of her bene gesserit homeworld she was beginning to see the vital thing here scytale realized that was good irulan though was another matter are you one of us or not scytale edric asked he stared out of tiny rodent eyes my allegiance is not the issue scytale said he kept his attention on irulan you are wondering princess if this was why you came all those parsecs risked so much she nodded agreement was it to bandy platitudes with a humanoid fish or dispute with a fat tleilaxu face dancer scytale asked she stepped away from edrics tank shaking her head in annoyance at the thick odor of melange edric took this moment to pop a melange pill into his mouth he ate the spice and breathed it and no doubt drank it scytale noted understandable because the spice heightened a steersmans prescience gave him the power to guide a guild heighliner across space at translight speeds with spice awareness he found that line of the ships future which avoided peril edric smelled another kind of peril now but his crutch of prescience might not find it i think it was a mistake for me to come here irulan said the reverend mother turned opened her eyes closed them a curiously reptilian gesture scytale shifted his gaze from irulan to the tank inviting the princess to share his viewpoint she would scytale knew see edric as a repellent figure the bold stare those monstrous feet and hands moving softly in the gas the smoky swirling of orange eddies around him she would wonder about his sex habits thinking how odd it would be to mate with such a one even the fieldforce generator which recreated for edric the weightlessness of space would set him apart from her now princess scytale said because of edric here your husbands oracular sight can not stumble upon certain incidents including this one presumably presumably irulan said eyes closed the reverend mother nodded the phenomenon of prescience is poorly understood even by its initiates she said i am a full guild navigator and have the power edric said again the reverend mother opened her eyes this time she stared at the face dancer eyes probing with that peculiar bene gesserit intensity she was weighing minutiae no reverend mother scytale murmured i am not as simple as i appeared we dont understand this power of second sight irulan said theres a point edric says my husband can not see know or predict what happens within the sphere of a navigators influence but how far does that influence extend there are people and things in our universe which i know only by their effects edric said his fish mouth held in a thin line i know they have been here there somewhere as water creatures stir up the currents in their passage so the prescient stir up time i have seen where your husband has been never have i seen him nor the people who truly share his aims and loyalties this is the concealment which an adept gives to those who are his irulan is not yours scytale said and he looked sideways at the princess we all know why the conspiracy must be conducted only in my presence edric said using the voice mode for describing a machine irulan said you have your uses apparently she sees him now for what he is scytale thought good the future is a thing to be shaped scytale said hold that thought princess irulan glanced at the face dancer people who share pauls aims and loyalties she said certain of his fremen legionaries then wear his cloak i have seen him prophesy for them heard their cries of adulation for their mahdi their muaddib it has occurred to her scytale thought that she is on trial here that a judgment remains to be made which could preserve her or destroy her she sees the trap we set for her momentarily scytales gaze locked with that of the reverend mother and he experienced the odd realization that they had shared this thought about irulan the bene gesserit of course had briefed their princess primed her with the lie adroit but the moment always came when a bene gesserit must trust her own training and instincts princess i know what it is you most desire from the emperor edric said who does not know it irulan asked you wish to be the founding mother of the royal dynasty edric said as though he had not heard her unless you join us that will never happen take my oracular word on it the emperor married you for political reasons but youll never share his bed so the oracle is also a voyeur irulan sneered the emperor is more firmly wedded to his fremen concubine than he is to you edric snapped and she gives him no heir irulan said reason is the first victim of strong emotion scytale murmured he sensed the outpouring of irulans anger saw his admonition take effect she gives him no heir irulan said her voice measuring out controlled calmness because i am secretly administering a contraceptive is that the sort of admission you wanted from me itd not be a thing for the emperor to discover edric said smiling i have lies ready for him irulan said he may have truthsense but some lies are easier to believe than the truth you must make the choice princess scytale said but understand what it is protects you paul is fair with me she said i sit in his council in the twelve years youve been his princess consort edric asked has he shown you the slightest warmth irulan shook her head he deposed your father with his infamous fremen horde married you to fix his claim to the throne yet he has never crowned you empress edric said edric tries to sway you with emotion princess scytale said is that not interesting she glanced at the face dancer saw the bold smile on his features answered it with raised eyebrows she was fully aware now scytale saw that if she left this conference under edrics sway part of their plot these moments might be concealed from pauls oracular vision if she withheld commitment though does it seem to you princess scytale asked that edric holds undue sway in our conspiracy ive already agreed edric said that ill defer to the best judgment offered in our councils and who chooses the best judgment scytale asked do you wish the princess to leave here without joining us edric asked he wishes her commitment to be a real one the reverend mother growled there should be no trickery between us irulan scytale saw had relaxed into a thinking posture hands concealed in the sleeves of her robe she would be thinking now of the bait edric had offered to found a royal dynasty she would be wondering what scheme the conspirators had provided to protect themselves from her she would be weighing many things scytale irulan said presently it is said that you tleilaxu have an odd system of honor your victims must always have a means of escape if they can but find it scytale agreed am i a victim irulan asked a burst of laughter escaped scytale the reverend mother snorted princess edric said his voice softly persuasive you already are one of us have no fear of that do you not spy upon the imperial household for your bene gesserit superiors paul knows i report to my teachers she said but dont you give them the material for strong propaganda against your emperor edric asked not our emperor scytale noted your emperor irulan is too much the bene gesserit to miss that slip the question is one of powers and how they may be used scytale said moving closer to the guildsmans tank we of the tleilaxu believe that in all the universe there is only the insatiable appetite of matter that energy is the only true solid and energy learns hear me well princess energy learns this we call power you havent convinced me we can defeat the emperor irulan said we havent even convinced ourselves scytale said everywhere we turn irulan said his power confronts us hes the kwisatz haderach the one who can be many places at once hes the mahdi whose merest whim is absolute command to his qizarate missionaries hes the mentat whose computational mind surpasses the greatest ancient computers he is muaddib whose orders to the fremen legions depopulate planets he possesses oracular vision which sees into the future he has that gene pattern which we bene gesserits covet for we know his attributes the reverend mother interrupted and we know the abomination his sister alia possesses this gene pattern but theyre also humans both of them thus they have weaknesses and where are those human weaknesses the face dancer asked shall we search for them in the religious arm of his jihad can the emperors qizara be turned against him what about the civil authority of the great houses can the landsraad congress do more than raise a verbal clamor i suggest the combine honnete ober advancer mercantiles edric said turning in his tank choam is business and business follows profits or perhaps the emperors mother scytale said the lady jessica i understand remains on caladan but is in frequent communication with her son that traitorous bitch mohiam said voice level would i might disown my own hands which trained her our conspiracy requires a lever scytale said we are more than conspirators the reverend mother countered ah yes scytale agreed we are energetic and we learn quickly this makes us the one true hope the certain salvation of humankind he spoke in the speech mode for absolute conviction which was perhaps the ultimate sneer coming as it did from a tleilaxu only the reverend mother appeared to understand the subtlety why she asked directing the question at scytale before the face dancer could answer edric cleared his throat said let us not bandy philosophical nonsense every question can be boiled down to the one why is there anything every religious business and governmental question has the single derivative who will exercise the power alliances combines complexes they all chase mirages unless they go for the power all else is nonsense as most thinking beings come to realize scytale shrugged a gesture designed solely for the reverend mother edric had answered her question for him the pontificating fool was their major weakness to make sure the reverend mother understood scytale said listening carefully to the teacher one acquires an education the reverend mother nodded slowly princess edric said make your choice you have been chosen as an instrument of destiny the very finest save your praise for those who can be swayed by it irulan said earlier you mentioned a ghost a revenant with which we may contaminate the emperor explain this the atreides will defeat himself edric crowed stop talking riddles irulan snapped what is this ghost a very unusual ghost edric said it has a body and a name the body thats the flesh of a renowned swordmaster known as duncan idaho the name idahos dead irulan said paul has mourned the loss often in my presence he saw idaho killed by my fathers sardaukar even in defeat edric said your fathers sardaukar did not abandon wisdom let us suppose a wise sardaukar commander recognized the swordmaster in a corpse his men had slain what then there exist uses for such flesh and training if one acts swiftly a tleilaxu ghola irulan whispered looking sideways at scytale scytale observing her attention exercised his facedancer powers shape flowing into shape flesh moving and readjusting presently a slender man stood before her the face remained somewhat round but darker and with slightly flattened features high cheekbones formed shelves for eyes with definite epicanthic folds the hair was black and unruly a ghola of this appearance edric said pointing to scytale or merely another face dancer irulan asked no face dancer edric said a face dancer risks exposure under prolonged surveillance no let us assume that our wise sardaukar commander had idahos corpse preserved for the axolotl tanks why not this corpse held the flesh and nerves of one of the finest swordsmen in history an adviser to the atreides a military genius what a waste to lose all that training and ability when it might be revived as an instructor for the sardaukar i heard not a whisper of this and i was one of my fathers confidantes irulan said ahh but your father was a defeated man and within a few hours you had been sold to the new emperor edric said was it done she demanded with a maddening air of complacency edric said let us presume that our wise sardaukar commander knowing the need for speed immediately sent the preserved flesh of idaho to the bene tleilaxu let us suppose further that the commander and his men died before conveying this information to your father who couldnt have made much use of it anyway there would remain then a physical fact a bit of flesh which had been sent off to the tleilaxu there was only one way for it to be sent of course on a heighliner we of the guild naturally know every cargo we transport learning of this one would we not think it additional wisdom to purchase the ghola as a gift befitting an emperor youve done it then irulan said scytale who had resumed his rolypoly first appearance said as our longwinded friend indicates weve done it how has idaho been conditioned irulan asked idaho edric asked looking at the tleilaxu do you know of an idaho scytale we sold you a creature called hayt scytale said ah yes hayt edric said why did you sell him to us because we once bred a kwisatz haderach of our own scytale said with a quick movement of her old head the reverend mother looked up at him you didnt tell us that she accused you didnt ask scytale said how did you overcome your kwisatz haderach irulan asked a creature who has spent his life creating one particular representation of his selfdom will die rather than become the antithesis of that representation scytale said i do not understand edric ventured he killed himself the reverend mother growled follow me well reverend mother scytale warned using a voice mode which said you are not a sex object have never been a sex object can not be a sex object the tleilaxu waited for the blatant emphasis to sink in she must not mistake his intent realization must pass through anger into awareness that the tleilaxu certainly could not make such an accusation knowing as he must the breeding requirements of the sisterhood his words though contained a gutter insult completely out of character for a tleilaxu swiftly using the mirabhasa placative mode edric tried to smooth over the moment scytale you told us you sold hayt because you shared our desire on how to use him edric you will remain silent until i give you permission to speak scytale said and as the guildsman started to protest the reverend mother snapped shut up edric the guildsman drew back into his tank in flailing agitation our own transient emotions arent pertinent to a solution of the mutual problem scytale said they cloud reasoning because the only relevant emotion is the basic fear which brought us to this meeting we understand irulan said glancing at the reverend mother you must see the dangerous limitations of our shield scytale said the oracle can not chance upon what it can not understand you are devious scytale irulan said how devious she must not guess scytale thought when this is done we will possess a kwisatz haderach we can control these others will possess nothing what was the origin of your kwisatz haderach the reverend mother asked weve dabbled in various pure essences scytale said pure good and pure evil a pure villain who delights only in creating pain and terror can be quite educational the old baron harkonnen our emperors grandfather was he a tleilaxu creation irulan asked not one of ours scytale said but then nature often produces creations as deadly as ours we merely produce them under conditions where we can study them i will not be passed by and treated this way edric protested who is it hides this meeting from you see scytale asked whose best judgment conceals us what judgment i wish to discuss our mode of giving hayt to the emperor edric insisted its my understanding that hayt reflects the old morality that the atreides learned on his birthworld hayt is supposed to make it easy for the emperor to enlarge his moral nature to delineate the positivenegative elements of life and religion scytale smiled passing a benign gaze over his companions they were as hed been led to expect the old reverend mother wielded her emotions like a scythe irulan had been well trained for a task at which she had failed a flawed bene gesserit creation edric was no more and no less than the magicians hand he might conceal and distract for now edric relapsed into sullen silence as the others ignored him do i understand that this hayt is intended to poison pauls psyche irulan asked more or less scytale said and what of the qizarate irulan asked it requires only the slightest shift in emphasis a glissade of the emotions to transform envy into enmity scytale said and choam irulan asked they will rally round profit scytale said what of the other power groups one invokes the name of government scytale said we will annex the less powerful in the name of morality and progress our opposition will die of its own entanglements alia too hayt is a multipurpose ghola scytale said the emperors sister is of an age when she can be distracted by a charming male designed for that purpose she will be attracted by his maleness and by his abilities as a mentat mohiam allowed her old eyes to go wide in surprise the gholas a mentat thats a dangerous move to be accurate irulan said a mentat must have accurate data what if paul asks him to define the purpose behind our gift hayt will tell the truth scytale said it makes no difference so you leave an escape door open for paul irulan said a mentat mohiam muttered scytale glanced at the old reverend mother seeing the ancient hates which colored her responses from the days of the butlerian jihad when thinking machines had been wiped from most of the universe computers had inspired distrust old emotions colored the human computer as well i do not like the way you smile mohiam said abruptly speaking in the truth mode as she glared up at scytale in the same mode scytale said and i think less of what pleases you but we must work together we all see that he glanced at the guildsman dont we edric you teach painful lessons edric said i presume you wished to make it plain that i must not assert myself against the combined judgments of my fellow conspirators you see he can be taught scytale said i see other things as well edric growled the atreides holds a monopoly on the spice without it i can not probe the future the bene gesserit lose their truthsense we have stockpiles but these are finite melange is a powerful coin our civilization has more than one coin scytale said thus the law of supply and demand fails you think to steal the secret of it mohiam wheezed and him with a planet guarded by his mad fremen the fremen are civil educated and ignorant scytale said theyre not mad theyre trained to believe not to know belief can be manipulated only knowledge is dangerous but will i be left with something to father a royal dynasty irulan asked they all heard the commitment in her voice but only edric smiled at it something scytale said something it means the end of this atreides as a ruling force edric said i should imagine that others less gifted as oracles have made that prediction scytale said for them mektub al mellah as the fremen say the thing was written with salt irulan translated as she spoke scytale recognized what the bene gesserit had arrayed here for him a beautiful and intelligent female who could never be his ah well he thought perhaps ill copy her for another every civilization must contend with an unconscious force which can block betray or countermand almost any conscious intention of the collectivity tleilaxu theorem unproven paul sat on the edge of his bed and began stripping off his desert boots they smelled rancid from the lubricant which eased the action of the heelpowered pumps that drove his stillsuit it was late he had prolonged his nighttime walk and caused worry for those who loved him admittedly the walks were dangerous but it was a kind of danger he could recognize and meet immediately something compelling and attractive surrounded walking anonymously at night in the streets of arrakeen he tossed the boots into the corner beneath the rooms lone glowglobe attacked the seal strips of his stillsuit gods below how tired he was the tiredness stopped at his muscles though and left his mind seething watching the mundane activities of everyday life filled him with profound envy most of that nameless flowing life outside the walls of his keep couldnt be shared by an emperor but to walk down a public street without attracting attention what a privilege to pass by the clamoring of mendicant pilgrims to hear a fremen curse a shopkeeper you have damp hands paul smiled at the memory slipped out of his stillsuit he stood naked and oddly attuned to his world dune was a world of paradox now a world under siege yet the center of power to come under siege he decided was the inevitable fate of power he stared down at the green carpeting feeling its rough texture against his soles the streets had been ankle deep in sand blown over the shield wall on the stratus wind foot traffic had churned it into choking dust which clogged stillsuit filters he could smell the dust even now despite a blower cleaning at the portals of his keep it was an odor full of desert memories other days other dangers compared to those other days the peril in his lonely walks remained minor but putting on a stillsuit he put on the desert the suit with all its apparatus for reclaiming his bodys moisture guided his thoughts in subtle ways fixed his movements in a desert pattern he became wild fremen more than a disguise the suit made of him a stranger to his city self in the stillsuit he abandoned security and put on the old skills of violence pilgrims and townfolk passed him then with eyes downcast they left the wild ones strictly alone out of prudence if the desert had a face for city folk it was a fremen face concealed by a stillsuits mouthnose filters in truth there existed now only the small danger that someone from the old sietch days might mark him by his walk by his odor or by his eyes even then the chances of meeting an enemy remained small a swish of door hangings and a wash of light broke his reverie chani entered bearing his coffee service on a platinum tray two slaved glowglobes followed her darting to their positions one at the head of their bed one hovering beside her to light her work chani moved with an ageless air of fragile power so selfcontained so vulnerable something about the way she bent over the coffee service reminded him then of their first days her features remained darkly elfin seemingly unmarked by their years unless one examined the outer corners of her whiteless eyes noting the lines there sandtracks the fremen of the desert called them steam wafted from the pot as she lifted the lid by its hagar emerald knob he could tell the coffee wasnt yet ready by the way she replaced the lid the pot fluting silver female shape pregnant had come to him as a ghanima a spoil of battle won when hed slain the former owner in single combat jamis thatd been the mans name jamis what an odd immortality death had earned for jamis knowing death to be inevitable had jamis carried that particular one in his hand chani put out cups blue pottery squatting like attendants beneath the immense pot there were three cups one for each drinker and one for all the former owners itll only be a moment she said she looked at him then and paul wondered how he appeared in her eyes was he yet the exotic offworlder slim and wiry but waterfat when compared to fremen had he remained the usul of his tribal name whod taken her in fremen tau while theyd been fugitives in the desert paul stared down at his own body hard muscles slender a few more scars but essentially the same despite twelve years as emperor looking up he glimpsed his face in a shelf mirror blueblue fremen eyes mark of spice addiction a sharp atreides nose he looked the proper grandson for an atreides whod died in the bullring creating a spectacle for his people something the old man had said slipped then into pauls mind one who rules assumes irrevocable responsibility for the ruled you are a husbandman this demands at times a selfless act of love which may only be amusing to those you rule people still remembered that old man with affection and what have i done for the atreides name paul asked himself ive loosed the wolf among the sheep for a moment he contemplated all the death and violence going on in his mind into bed now chani said in a sharp tone of command that paul knew wouldve shocked his imperial subjects he obeyed lay back with his hands behind his head letting himself be lulled by the pleasant familiarity of chanis movements the room around them struck him suddenly with amusement it was not at all what the populace must imagine as the emperors bedchamber the yellow light of restless glowglobes moved the shadows in an array of colored glass jars on a shelf behind chani paul named their contents silently the dry ingredients of the desert pharmacopoeia unguents incense mementos a pinch of sand from sietch tabr a lock of hair from their firstborn long dead twelve years dead an innocent bystander killed in the battle that had made paul emperor the rich odor of spicecoffee filled the room paul inhaled his glance falling on a yellow bowl beside the tray where chani was preparing the coffee the bowl held ground nuts the inevitable poisonsnooper mounted beneath the table waved its insect arms over the food the snooper angered him theyd never needed snoopers in the desert days coffees ready chani said are you hungry his angry denial was drowned in the whistling scream of a spice lighter hurling itself spaceward from the field outside arrakeen chani saw his anger though poured their coffee put a cup near his hand she sat down on the foot of the bed exposed his legs began rubbing them where the muscles were knotted from walking in the stillsuit softly with a casual air which did not deceive him she said let us discuss irulans desire for a child pauls eyes snapped wide open he studied chani carefully irulans been back from wallach less than two days he said has she been at you already weve not discussed her frustrations chani said paul forced his mind to mental alertness examined chani in the harsh light of observational minutiae the bene gesserit way his mother had taught him in violation of her vows it was a thing he didnt like doing with chani part of her hold on him lay in the fact he so seldom needed his tensionbuilding powers with her chani mostly avoided indiscreet questions she maintained a fremen sense of good manners hers were more often practical questions what interested chani were facts which bore on the position of her man his strength in council the loyalty of his legions the abilities and talents of his allies her memory held catalogs of names and crossindexed details she could rattle off the major weakness of every known enemy the potential dispositions of opposing forces battle plans of their military leaders the tooling and production capacities of basic industries why now paul wondered did she ask about irulan ive troubled your mind chani said that wasnt my intention what was your intention she smiled shyly meeting his gaze if youre angered love please dont hide it paul sank back against the headboard shall i put her away he asked her use is limited now and i dont like the things i sense about her trip home to the sisterhood youll not put her away chani said she went on massaging his legs spoke matteroffactly youve said many times shes your contact with our enemies that you can read their plans through her actions then why ask about her desire for a child i think itd disconcert our enemies and put irulan in a vulnerable position should you make her pregnant he read by the movements of her hands on his legs what that statement had cost her a lump rose in his throat softly he said chani beloved i swore an oath never to take her into my bed a child would give her too much power would you have her displace you i have no place not so sihaya my desert springtime what is this sudden concern for irulan its concern for you not for her if she carried an atreides child her friends would question her loyalties the less trust our enemies place in her the less use she is to them a child for her could mean your death paul said you know the plotting in this place a movement of his arm encompassed the keep you must have an heir she husked ahhh he said so that was it chani had not produced a child for him someone else then must do it why not irulan that was the way chanis mind worked and it must be done in an act of love because all the empire avowed strong taboos against artificial ways chani had come to a fremen decision paul studied her face in this new light it was a face he knew better in some ways than his own he had seen this face soft with passion in the sweetness of sleep awash in fears and angers and griefs he closed his eyes and chani came into his memories as a girl once more veiled in springtime singing waking from sleep beside him so perfect that the very vision of her consumed him in his memory she smiled shyly at first then strained against the vision as though she longed to escape pauls mouth went dry for a moment his nostrils tasted the smoke of a devastated future and the voice of another kind of vision commanding him to disengage disengage disengage his prophetic visions had been eavesdropping on eternity for such a long while catching snatches of foreign tongues listening to stones and to flesh not his own since the day of his first encounter with terrible purpose he had peered at the future hoping to find peace there existed a way of course he knew it by heart without knowing the heart of it a rote future strict in its instructions to him disengage disengage disengage paul opened his eyes looked at the decision in chanis face she had stopped massaging his legs sat still now purest fremen her features remained familiar beneath the blue nezhoni scarf she often wore about her hair in the privacy of their chambers but the mask of decision sat on her an ancient and alientohim way of thinking fremen women had shared their men for thousands of years not always in peace but with a way of making the fact nondestructive something mysteriously fremen in this fashion had happened in chani youll give me the only heir i want he said youve seen this she asked making it obvious by her emphasis that she referred to prescience as he had done many times paul wondered how he could explain the delicacy of the oracle the timelines without number which vision waved before him on an undulating fabric he sighed remembered water lifted from a river in the hollow of his hands trembling draining memory drenched his face in it how could he drench himself in futures growing increasingly obscure from the pressures of too many oracles youve not seen it then chani said that visionfuture scarce any longer accessible to him except at the expenditure of lifedraining effort what could it show them except grief paul asked himself he felt that he occupied an inhospitable middle zone a wasted place where his emotions drifted swayed swept outward in unchecked restlessness chani covered his legs said an heir to house atreides this is not something you leave to chance or one woman that was a thing his mother mightve said paul thought he wondered if the lady jessica had been in secret communication with chani his mother would think in terms of house atreides it was a pattern bred and conditioned into her by the bene gesserit and would hold true even now when her powers were turned against the sisterhood you listened when irulan came to me today he accused i listened she spoke without looking at him paul focused his memory on the encounter with irulan hed let himself into the family salon noted an unfinished robe on chanis loom thered been an acrid wormsmell to the place an evil odor which almost hid the underlying cinnamon bite of melange someone had spilled unchanged spice essence and left it to combine there with a spicebased rug it had not been a felicitous combination spice essence had dissolved the rug oily marks lay congealed on the plastone floor where the rug had been hed thought to send for someone to clean away the mess but harah stilgars wife and chanis closest feminine friend had slipped in to announce irulan hed been forced to conduct the interview in the presence of that evil smell unable to escape a fremen superstition that evil smells foretold disaster harah withdrew as irulan entered welcome paul said irulan wore a robe of gray whale fur she pulled it close touched a hand to her hair he could see her wondering at his mild tone the angry words shed obviously prepared for this meeting could be sensed leaving her mind in a welter of second thoughts you came to report that the sisterhood had lost its last vestige of morality he said isnt it dangerous to be that ridiculous she asked to be ridiculous and dangerous a questionable alliance he said his renegade bene gesserit training detected her putting down an impulse to withdraw the effort exposed a brief glimpse of underlying fear and he saw shed been assigned a task not to her liking they expect a bit too much from a princess of the blood royal he said irulan grew very still and paul became aware that she had locked herself into a viselike control a heavy burden indeed he thought and he wondered why prescient visions had given him no glimpse of this possible future slowly irulan relaxed there was no point in surrendering to fear no point in retreat she had decided youve allowed the weather to fall into a very primitive pattern she said rubbing her arms through the robe it was dry and there was a sandstorm today are you never going to let it rain here you didnt come here to talk about the weather paul said he felt that he had been submerged in double meanings was irulan trying to tell him something which her training would not permit her to say openly it seemed that way he felt that he had been cast adrift suddenly and now must thrash his way back to some steady place i must have a child she said he shook his head from side to side i must have my way she snapped if need be ill find another father for my child ill cuckold you and dare you to expose me cuckold me all you wish he said but no child how can you stop me with a smile of upmost kindness he said id have you garroted if it came to that shocked silence held her for a moment and paul sensed chani listened behind the heavy draperies into their private apartments i am your wife irulan whispered let us not play these silly games he said you play a part no more we both know who my wife is and i am a convenience nothing more she said voice heavy with bitterness i have no wish to be cruel to you he said you chose me for this position not i he said fate chose you your father chose you the bene gesserit chose you the guild chose you and they have chosen you once more for what have they chosen you irulan why cant i have your child because thats a role for which you werent chosen its my right to bear the royal heir my father was your father was and is a beast we both know hed lost almost all touch with the humanity he was supposed to rule and protect was he hated less than youre hated she flared a good question he agreed a sardonic smile touching the edges of his mouth you say youve no wish to be cruel to me yet and thats why i agree that you can take any lover you choose but understand me well take a lover but bring no sourfathered child into my household i would deny such a child i dont begrudge you any male alliance as long as you are discreet and childless id be silly to feel otherwise under the circumstances but dont presume upon this license which i freely bestow where the throne is concerned i control what blood is heir to it the bene gesserit doesnt control this nor does the guild this is one of the privileges i won when i smashed your fathers sardaukar legions out there on the plain of arrakeen its on your head then irulan said she whirled and swept out of the chamber remembering the encounter now paul brought his awareness out of it and focused on chani seated beside him on their bed he could understand his ambivalent feelings about irulan understand chanis fremen decision under other circumstances chani and irulan might have been friends what have you decided chani asked no child he said chani made the fremen crysknife sign with the index finger and thumb of her right hand it could come to that he agreed you dont think a child would solve anything with irulan she asked only a fool would think that i am not a fool my love anger possessed him ive never said you were but this isnt some damned romantic novel were discussing thats a real princess down the hall she was raised in all the nasty intrigues of an imperial court plotting is as natural to her as writing her stupid histories they are not stupid love probably not he brought his anger under control took her hand in his sorry but that woman has many plots plots within plots give into one of her ambitions and you could advance another of them her voice mild chani said havent i always said as much yes of course you have he stared at her then what are you really trying to say to me she lay down beside him placed her hand against his neck they have come to a decision on how to fight you she said irulan reeks of secret decisions paul stroked her hair chani had peeled away the dross terrible purpose brushed him it was a coriolis wind in his soul it whistled through the framework of his being his body knew things then never learned in consciousness chani beloved he whispered do you know what id spend to end the jihad to separate myself from the damnable godhead the qizarate forces onto me she trembled you have but to command it she said oh no even if i died now my name would still lead them when i think of the atreides name tied to this religious butchery but youre the emperor youve im a figurehead when godheads given thats the one thing the socalled god no longer controls a bitter laugh shook him he sensed the future looking back at him out of dynasties not even dreamed he felt his being cast out crying unchained from the rings of fate only his name continued i was chosen he said perhaps at birth certainly before i had much say in it i was chosen then unchoose she said his arm tightened around her shoulder in time beloved give me yet a little time unshed tears burned his eyes we should return to sietch tabr chani said theres too much to contend with in this tent of stone he nodded his chin moving against the smooth fabric of the scarf which covered her hair the soothing spice smell of her filled his nostrils sietch the ancient chakobsa word absorbed him a place of retreat and safety in a time of peril chanis suggestion made him long for vistas of open sand for clean distances where one could see an enemy coming from a long way off the tribes expect muaddib to return to them she said she lifted her head to look at him you belong to us i belong to a vision he whispered he thought then of the jihad of the gene mingling across parsecs and the vision which told him how he might end it should he pay the price all the hatefulness would evaporate dying as fires die ember by ember but oh the terrifying price i never wanted to be a god he thought i wanted only to disappear like a jewel of trace dew caught by the morning i wanted to escape the angels and the damned alone as though by an oversight will we go back to the sietch chani pressed yes he whispered and he thought i must pay the price chani heaved a deep sigh settled back against him ive loitered he thought and he saw how hed been hemmed in by boundaries of love and the jihad and what was one life no matter how beloved against all the lives the jihad was certain to take could single misery be weighed against the agony of multitudes love chani said questioning he put a hand against her lips ill yield up myself he thought ill rush out while i yet have the strength fly through a space a bird might not find it was a useless thought and he knew it the jihad would follow his ghost what could he answer he wondered how explain when people taxed him with brutal foolishness who might understand i wanted only to look back and say there theres an existence which couldnt hold me see i vanish no restraint or net of human devising can trap me ever again i renounce my religion this glorious instant is mine im free what empty words a big worm was seen below the shield wall yesterday chani said more than a hundred meters long they say such big ones come rarely into this region any more the water repels them i suppose they say this one came to summon muaddib home to his desert she pinched his chest dont laugh at me im not laughing paul caught by wonder at the persistent fremen mythos felt a heart constriction a thing inflicted upon his lifeline adab the demanding memory he recalled his childhood room on caladan then dark night in the stone chamber a vision itd been one of his earliest prescient moments he felt his mind dive into the vision saw through a veiled cloudmemory visionwithinvision a line of fremen their robes trimmed with dust they paraded past a gap in tall rocks they carried a long clothwrapped burden and paul heard himself say in the vision it was mostly sweet but you were the sweetest of all adab released him youre so quiet chani whispered what is it paul shuddered sat up face averted youre angry because ive been to the deserts edge chani said he shook his head without speaking i only went because i want a child chani said paul was unable to speak he felt himself consumed by the raw power of that early vision terrible purpose in that moment his whole life was a limb shaken by the departure of a bird and the bird was chance free will i succumbed to the lure of the oracle he thought and he sensed that succumbing to this lure might be to fix himself upon a singletrack life could it be he wondered that the oracle didnt tell the future could it be that the oracle made the future had he exposed his life to some web of underlying threads trapped himself there in that longago awakening victim of a spiderfuture which even now advanced upon him with terrifying jaws a bene gesserit axiom slipped into his mind to use raw power is to make yourself infinitely vulnerable to greater powers i know it angers you chani said touching his arm its true that the tribes have revived the old rites and the blood sacrifices but i took no part in those paul inhaled a deep trembling breath the torrent of his vision dissipated became a deep still place whose currents moved with absorbing power beyond his reach please chani begged i want a child our child is that a terrible thing paul caressed her arm where she touched him pulled away he climbed from the bed extinguished the glowglobes crossed to the balcony window opened the draperies the deep desert could not intrude here except by its odors a windowless wall climbed to the night sky across from him moonlight slanted down into an enclosed garden sentinel trees and broad leaves wet foliage he could see a fishpond reflecting stars among the leaves pockets of white floral brilliance in the shadows momentarily he saw the garden through fremen eyes alien menacing dangerous in its waste of water he thought of the water sellers their way destroyed by the lavish dispensing from his hands they hated him hed slain the past and there were others even those whod fought for the sols to buy precious water who hated him for changing the old ways as the ecological pattern dictated by muaddib remade the planets landscape human resistance increased was it not presumptuous he wondered to think he could make over an entire planet everything growing where and how he told it to grow even if he succeeded what of the universe waiting out there did it fear similar treatment abruptly he closed the draperies sealed the ventilators he turned toward chani in the darkness felt her waiting there her water rings tinkled like the almsbells of pilgrims he groped his way to the sound encountered her outstretched arms beloved she whispered have i troubled you her arms enclosed his future as they enclosed him not you he said oh not you the advent of the field process shield and the lasgun with their explosive interaction deadly to attacker and attacked placed the current determinatives on weapons technology we need not go into the special role of atomics the fact that any family in my empire could so deploy its atomics as to destroy the planetary bases of fifty or more other families causes some nervousness true but all of us possess precautionary plans for devastating retaliation guild and landsraad contain the keys which hold this force in check no my concern goes to the development of humans as special weapons here is a virtually unlimited field which a few powers are developing muaddib lecture to the war college from the stilgar chronicle the old man stood in his doorway peering out with blueinblue eyes the eyes were veiled by that native suspicion all desert folk held for strangers bitter lines tortured the edges of his mouth where it could be seen through a fringe of white beard he wore no stillsuit and it said much that he ignored this fact in the full knowledge of the moisture pouring from his house through the open door scytale bowed gave the greeting signal of the conspiracy from somewhere behind the old man came the sound of a rebec wailing through the atonal dissonance of semuta music the old mans manner carried no drug dullness an indication that semuta was the weakness of another it seemed strange to scytale though to find that sophisticated vice in this place greetings from afar scytale said smiling through the flatfeatured face he had chosen for this encounter it occurred to him then that this old man might recognize the chosen face some of the older fremen here on dune had known duncan idaho the choice of features which he had thought amusing might have been a mistake scytale decided but he dared not change the face out here he cast nervous glances up and down the street would the old man never invite him inside did you know my son the old man asked that at least was one of the countersigns scytale made the proper response all the time keeping his eyes alert for any suspicious circumstance in his surroundings he did not like his position here the street was a culdesac ending in this house the houses all around had been built for veterans of the jihad they formed a suburb of arrakeen which stretched into the imperial basin past tiemag the walls which hemmed in this street presented blank faces of dun plasmeld broken by dark shadows of sealed doorways and here and there scrawled obscenities beside this very door someone had chalked a pronouncement that one beris had brought back to arrakis a loathsome disease which deprived him of his manhood do you come in partnership the old man asked alone scytale said the old man cleared his throat still hesitating in that maddening way scytale cautioned himself to patience contact in this fashion carried its own dangers perhaps the old man knew some reason for carrying on this way it was the proper hour though the pale sun stood almost directly overhead people of this quarter remained sealed in their houses to sleep through the hot part of the day was it the new neighbor who bothered the old man scytale wondered the adjoining house he knew had been assigned to otheym once a member of muaddibs dreaded fedaykin death commandos and bijaz the catalystdwarf waited with otheym scytale returned his gaze to the old man noted the empty sleeve dangling from the left shoulder and the lack of a stillsuit an air of command hung about this old man hed been no foot slogger in the jihad may i know the visitors name the old man asked scytale suppressed a sigh of relief he was to be accepted after all i am zaal he said giving the name assigned him for this mission i am farok the old man said once bashar of the ninth legion in the jihad does this mean anything to you scytale read menace in the words said you were born in sietch tabr with allegiance to stilgar farok relaxed stepped aside you are welcome in my house scytale slipped past him into a shadowy atrium blue tile floor glittering designs worked in crystal on the walls beyond the atrium was a covered courtyard light admitted by translucent filters spread an opalescence as silvery as the whitenight of first moon the street door grated into its moisture seals behind him we were a noble people farok said leading the way toward the courtyard we were not of the castout we lived in no graben village such as this we had a proper sietch in the shield wall above habbanya ridge one worm could carry us into kedem the inner desert not like this scytale agreed realizing now what had brought farok into the conspiracy the fremen longed for the old days and the old ways they entered the courtyard farok struggled with an intense dislike for his visitor scytale realized fremen distrusted eyes that were not the total blue of the ibad offworlders fremen said had unfocused eyes which saw things they were not supposed to see the semuta music had stopped at their entrance it was replaced now by the strum of a baliset first a ninescale chord then the clear notes of a song which was popular on the naraj worlds as his eyes adjusted to the light scytale saw a youth sitting crosslegged on a low divan beneath arches to his right the youths eyes were empty sockets with that uncanny facility of the blind he began singing the moment scytale focused on him the voice was high and sweet a wind has blown the land away and blown the sky away and all the men who is this wind the trees stand unbent drinking where men drank ive known too many worlds too many men too many trees too many winds those were not the original words of the song scytale noted farok led him away from the youth and under the arches on the opposite side indicated cushions scattered over the tile floor the tile was worked into designs of sea creatures there is a cushion once occupied in sietch by muaddib farok said indicating a round black mound it is yours now i am in your debt scytale said sinking to the black mound he smiled farok displayed wisdom a sage spoke of loyalty even while listening to songs of hidden meaning and words with secret messages who could deny the terrifying powers of the tyrant emperor inserting his words across the song without breaking the meter farok said does my sons music disturb you scytale gestured to a cushion facing him put his back against a cool pillar i enjoy music my son lost his eyes in the conquest of naraj farok said he was nursed there and should have stayed no woman of the people will have him thus i find it curious though to know i have grandchildren on naraj that i may never see do you know the naraj worlds zaal in my youth i toured there with a troupe of my fellow face dancers scytale said you are a face dancer then farok said i had wondered at your features they reminded me of a man i knew here once duncan idaho that one yes a swordmaster in the emperors pay he was killed so it is said so it is said farok agreed are you truly a man then ive heard stories about face dancers that he shrugged we are jadacha hermaphrodites scytale said either sex at will for the present i am a man farok pursed his lips in thought then may i call for refreshments do you desire water iced fruit talk will suffice scytale said the guests wish is a command farok said settling to the cushion which faced scytale blessed is abu d dhur father of the indefinite roads of time scytale said and he thought there ive told him straight out that i come from a guild steersman and wear the steersmans conconcealment thrice blessed farok said folding his hands into his lap in the ritual clasp they were old heavily veined hands an object seen from a distance betrays only its principle scytale said revealing that he wished to discuss the emperors fortress keep that which is dark and evil may be seen for evil at any distance farok said advising delay why scytale wondered but he said how did your son lose his eyes the naraj defenders used a stone burner farok said my son was too close cursed atomics even the stone burner should be outlawed it skirts the intent of the law scytale agreed and he thought a stone burner on naraj we werent told of that why does this old man speak of stone burners here i offered to buy tleilaxu eyes for him from your masters farok said but theres a story in the legions that tleilaxu eyes enslave their users my son told me that such eyes are metal and he is flesh that such a union must be sinful the principle of an object must fit its original intent scytale said trying to turn the conversation back to the information he sought faroks lips went thin but he nodded speak openly of what you wish he said we must put our trust in your steersman have you ever entered the imperial keep scytale asked i was there for the feast celebrating the molitor victory it was cold in all that stone despite the best ixian space heaters we slept on the terrace of alias fane the night before he has trees in there you know trees from many worlds we bashars were dressed in our finest green robes and had our tables set apart we ate and drank too much i was disgusted with some of the things i saw the walking wounded came dragging themselves along on their crutches i do not think our muaddib knows how many men he has maimed you objected to the feast scytale asked speaking from a knowledge of the fremen orgies which were ignited by spicebeer it was not like the mingling of our souls in the sietch farok said there was no tau for entertainment the troups had slave girls and the men shared the stories of their battles and their wounds so you were inside that great pile of stone scytale said muaddib came out to us on the terrace farok said good fortune to us all he said the greeting drill of the desert in that place do you know the location of his private apartments scytale asked deep inside farok said somewhere deep inside i am told he and chani live a nomadic life and that all within the walls of their keep out to the great hall he comes for the public audiences he has reception halls and formal meeting places a whole wing for his personal guard places for the ceremonies and an inner section for communications there is a room far beneath his fortress i am told where he keeps a stunted worm surrounded by a water moat with which to poison it here is where he reads the future myth all tangled up with facts scytale thought the apparatus of government accompanies him everywhere farok grumbled clerks and attendants and attendants for the attendants he trusts only the ones such as stilgar who were very close to him in the old days not you scytale said i think he has forgotten my existence farok said how does he come and go when he leaves that building scytale asked he has a tiny thopter landing which juts from an inner wall farok said i am told muaddib will not permit another to handle the controls for a landing there it requires an approach so it is said where the slightest miscalculation would plunge him down a sheer cliff of wall into one of his accursed gardens scytale nodded this most likely was true such an aerial entry to the emperors quarters would carry a certain measure of security the atreides were superb pilots all he uses men to carry his distrans messages farok said it demeans men to implant wave translators in them a mans voice should be his own to command it should not carry another mans message hidden within its sounds scytale shrugged all great powers used the distrans in this age one could never tell what obstacle might be placed between sender and addressee the distrans defied political cryptology because it relied on subtle distortions of natural sound patterns which could be scrambled with enormous intricacy even his tax officials use this method farok complained in my day the distrans was implanted only in the lower animals but revenue information must be kept secret scytale thought more than one government has fallen because people discovered the real extent of official wealth how do the fremen cohorts feel now about muaddibs jihad scytale asked do they object to making a god out of their emperor most of them dont even consider this farok said they think of the jihad the way i thought of it most of them it is a source of strange experiences adventure wealth this graben hovel in which i live farok gestured at the courtyard it cost sixty lidas of spice ninety kontars there was a time when i could not even imagine such riches he shook his head across the courtyard the blind youth took up the notes of a love ballad on his baliset ninety kontars scytale thought how strange great riches certainly faroks hovel would be a palace on many another world but all things were relative even the kontar did farok for example know whence came his measure for this weight of spice did he ever think to himself that one and a half kontar once limited a camel load not likely farok might never even have heard of a camel or of the golden age of earth his words oddly in rhythm to the melody of his sons baliset farok said i owned a crysknife water rings to ten liters my own lance which had been my fathers a coffee service a bottle made of red glass older than any memory in my sietch i had my own share of our spice but no money i was rich and did not know it two wives i had one plain and dear to me the other stupid and obstinate but with form and face of an angel i was a fremen naib a rider of worms master of the leviathan and of the sand the youth across the courtyard picked up the beat of his melody i knew many things without the need to think about them farok said i knew there was water far beneath our sand held there in bondage by the little makers i knew that my ancestors sacrificed virgins to shaihulud before lietkynes made us stop i had seen the jewels in the mouth of a worm my soul had four gates and i knew them all he fell silent musing then the atreides came with his witch mother scytale said the atreides came farok agreed the one we named usul in our sietch his private name among us our muaddib our mahdi and when he called for the jihad i was one of those who asked why should i go to fight there i have no relatives there but other men went young men friends companions of my childhood when they returned they spoke of wizardry of the power in this atreides savior he fought our enemy the harkonnen lietkynes who had promised us a paradise upon our planet blessed him it was said this atreides came to change our world and our universe that he was the man to make the golden flower blossom in the night farok held up his hands examined the palms men pointed to first moon and said his soul is there thus he was called muaddib i did not understand all this he lowered his hands stared across the courtyard at his son i had no thoughts in my head there were thoughts only in my heart and my belly and my loins again the tempo of the background music increased do you know why i enlisted in the jihad the old eyes stared hard at scytale i heard there was a thing called a sea it is very hard to believe in a sea when you have lived only here among our dunes we have no seas men of dune had never known a sea we had our windtraps we collected water for the great change lietkynes promised us this great change muaddib is bringing with a wave of his hand i could imagine a qanat water flowing across the land in a canal from this my mind could picture a river but a sea farok gazed at the translucent cover of his courtyard as though trying to probe into the universe beyond a sea he said voice low it was too much for my mind to picture yet men i knew said they had seen this marvel i thought they lied but i had to know for myself it was for this reason that i enlisted the youth struck a loud final chord on the baliset took up a new song with an oddly undulating rhythm did you find your sea scytale asked farok remained silent and scytale thought the old man had not heard the baliset music rose around them and fell like a tidal movement farok breathed to its rhythm there was a sunset farok said presently one of the elder artists might have painted such a sunset it had red in it the color of the glass in my bottle there was gold blue it was on the world they call enfeil the one where i led my legion to victory we came out of a mountain pass where the air was sick with water i could scarcely breathe it and there below me was the thing my friends had told me about water as far as i could see and farther we marched down to it i waded out into it and drank it was bitter and made me ill but the wonder of it has never left me scytale found himself sharing the old fremens awe i immersed myself in that sea farok said looking down at the water creatures worked into the tiles of his floor one man sank beneath that water another man arose from it i felt that i could remember a past which had never been i stared around me with eyes which could accept anything anything at all i saw a body in the water one of the defenders we had slain there was a log nearby supported on that water a piece of a great tree i can close my eyes now and see that log it was black on one end from a fire and there was a piece of cloth in that water no more than a yellow rag torn dirty i looked at all these things and i understood why they had come to this place it was for me to see them farok turned slowly stared into scytales eyes the universe is unfinished you know he said this one is garrulous but deep scytale thought and he said i can see it made a profound impression on you you are a tleilaxu farok said you have seen many seas i have seen only this one yet i know a thing about seas which you do not scytale found himself in the grip of an odd feeling of disquiet the mother of chaos was born in a sea farok said a qizara tafwid stood nearby when i came dripping from that water he had not entered the sea he stood on the sand it was wet sand with some of my men who shared his fear he watched me with eyes that knew i had learned something which was denied to him i had become a sea creature and i frightened him the sea healed me of the jihad and i think he saw this scytale realized that somewhere in this recital the music had stopped he found it disturbing that he could not place the instant when the baliset had fallen silent as though it were relevant to what hed been recounting farok said every gate is guarded theres no way into the emperors fortress thats its weakness scytale said farok stretched his neck upward peering theres a way in scytale explained the fact that most men including we may hope the emperor believe otherwise thats to our advantage he rubbed his lips feeling the strangeness of the visage hed chosen the musicians silence bothered him did it mean faroks son was through transmitting that had been the way of it naturally the message condensed and transmitted within the music it had been impressed upon scytales own neutral system there to be triggered at the proper moment by the distrans embedded in his adrenal cortex if it was ended he had become a container of unknown words he was a vessel sloshing with data every cell of the conspiracy here on arrakis every name every contact phrase all the vital information with this information they could brave arrakis capture a sandworm begin the culture of melange somewhere beyond muaddibs writ they could break the monopoly as they broke muaddib they could do many things with this information we have the woman here farok said do you wish to see her now ive seen her scytale said ive studied her with care where is she farok snapped his fingers the youth took up his rebec drew the bow across it semuta music wailed from the strings as though drawn by the sound a young woman in a blue robe emerged from a doorway behind the musician narcotic dullness filled her eyes which were the total blue of the ibad she was a fremen addicted to the spice and now caught by an offworld vice her awareness lay deep within the semuta lost somewhere and riding the ecstasy of the music otheyms daughter farok said my son gave her the narcotic in the hope of winning a woman of the people for himself despite his blindness as you can see his victory is empty semuta has taken what he hoped to gain her father doesnt know scytale asked she doesnt even know farok said my son supplies false memories with which she accounts to herself for her visits she thinks herself in love with him this is what her family believes they are outraged because he is not a complete man but they wont interfere of course the music trailed away to silence at a gesture from the musician the young woman seated herself beside him bent close to listen as he murmured to her what will you do with her farok asked once more scytale studied the courtyard who else is in this house he asked we are all here now farok said youve not told me what youll do with the woman it is my son who wishes to know as though about to answer scytale extended his right arm from the sleeve of his robe a glistening needle darted embedded itself in faroks neck there was no outcry no change of posture farok would be dead in a minute but he sat unmoving frozen by the darts poison slowly scytale climbed to his feet crossed to the blind musician the youth was still murmuring to the young woman when the dart whipped into him scytale took the young womans arm urged her gently to her feet shifted his own appearance before she looked at him she came erect focused on him what is it farok she asked my son is tired and must rest scytale said come well go out the back way we had such a nice talk she said i think ive convinced him to get tleilaxu eyes itd make a man of him again havent i said it many times scytale asked urging her into a rear chamber his voice he noted with pride matched his features precisely it unmistakably was the voice of the old fremen who certainly was dead by this time scytale sighed it had been done with sympathy he told himself and the victims certainly had known their peril now the young woman would have to be given her chance empires do not suffer emptiness of purpose at the time of their creation it is when they have become established that aims are lost and replaced by vague ritual words of muaddib by princess irulan it was going to be a bad session this meeting of the imperial council alia realized she sensed contention gathering force storing up energy the way irulan refused to look at chani stilgars nervous shuffling of papers the scowls paul directed at korba the qizara she seated herself at the end of the golden council table so she could look out the balcony windows at the dusty light of the afternoon korba interrupted by her entrance went on with something hed been saying to paul what i mean mlord is that there arent as many gods as once there were alia laughed throwing her head back the movement dropped the black hood of her aba robe her features lay exposed blueinblue spice eyes her mothers oval face beneath a cap of bronze hair small nose mouth wide and generous korbas cheeks went almost the color of his orange robe he glared at alia an angry gnome bald and fuming do you know whats being said about your brother he demanded i know whats being said about your qizarate alia countered youre not divines youre gods spies korba glanced at paul for support said we are sent by the writ of muaddib that he shall know the truth of his people and they shall know the truth of him spies alia said korba pursed his lips in injured silence paul looked at his sister wondering why she provoked korba abruptly he saw that alia had passed into womanhood beautiful with the first blazing innocence of youth he found himself surprised that he hadnt noticed it until this moment she was fifteen almost sixteen a reverend mother without motherhood virgin priestess object of fearful veneration for the superstitious masses alia of the knife this is not the time or place for your sisters levity irulan said paul ignored her nodded to korba the squares full of pilgrims go out and lead their prayer but they expect you mlord korba said put on your turban paul said theyll never know at this distance irulan smothered irritation at being ignored watched korba arise to obey shed had the sudden disquieting thought that edric might not hide her actions from alia what do we really know of the sister she wondered chani hands tightly clasped in her lap glanced across the table at stilgar her uncle pauls minister of state did the old fremen naib ever long for the simpler life of his desert sietch she wondered stilgars black hair she noted had begun to gray at the edges but his eyes beneath heavy brows remained farseeing it was the eagle stare of the wild and his beard still carried the catchtube indentation of life in a stillsuit made nervous by chanis attention stilgar looked around the council chamber his gaze fell on the balcony window and korba standing outside korba raised outstretched arms for the benediction and a trick of the afternoon sun cast a red halo onto the window behind him for a moment stilgar saw the court qizara as a figure crucified on a fiery wheel korba lowered his arms destroyed the illusion but stilgar remained shaken by it his thoughts went in angry frustration to the fawning supplicants waiting in the audience hall and to the hateful pomp which surrounded muaddibs throne convening with the emperor one hoped for a fault in him to find mistakes stilgar thought he felt this might be sacrilege but wanted it anyway distant crowd murmuring entered the chamber as korba returned the balcony door thumped into its seals behind him shutting off the sound pauls gaze followed the qizara korba took his seat at pauls left dark features composed eyes glazed by fanaticism hed enjoyed that moment of religious power the spirit presence has been invoked he said thank the lord for that alia said korbas lips went white again paul studied his sister wondered at her motives her innocence masked deception he told himself shed come out of the same bene gesserit breeding program as he had what had the kwisatz haderach genetics produced in her there was always that mysterious difference shed been an embryo in the womb when her mother had survived the raw melange poison mother and unborn daughter had become reverend mothers simultaneously but simultaneity didnt carry identity of the experience alia said that in one terrifying instant she had awakened to consciousness her memory absorbing the uncounted otherlives which her mother was assimilating i became my mother and all the others she said i was unformed unborn but i became an old woman then and there sensing his thoughts on her alia smiled at paul his expression softened how could anyone react to korba with other than cynical humor he asked himself what is more ridiculous than a death commando transformed into a priest stilgar tapped his papers if my liege permits he said these are matters urgent and dire the tupile treaty paul asked the guild maintains that we must sign this treaty without knowing the precise location of the tupile entente stilgar said theyve some support from landsraad delegates what pressures have you brought to bear irulan asked those pressures which my emperor has designated for this enterprise stilgar said the stiff formality of his reply contained all his disapproval of the princess consort my lord and husband irulan said turning to paul forcing him to acknowledge her emphasizing the titular difference in front of chani paul thought is a weakness in such moments he shared stiliars dislike for irulan but sympathy tempered his emotions what was irulan but a bene gesserit pawn yes paul said irulan stared at him if you withheld their melange chani shook her head in dissent we tread with caution paul said tupile remains the place of sanctuary for defeated great houses it symbolizes a last resort a final place of safety for all our subjects exposing the sanctuary makes it vulnerable if they can hide people they can hide other things stilgar rumbled an army perhaps or the beginnings of melange culture which you dont back people into a corner alia said not if you want them to remain peaceful ruefully she saw that shed been drawn into the contention which shed foreseen so weve spent ten years of negotiation for nothing irulan said none of my brothers actions is for nothing alia said irulan picked up a scribe gripped it with whiteknuckled intensity paul saw her marshal emotional control in the bene gesserit way the penetrating inward stare deep breathing he could almost hear her repeating the litany presently she said what have we gained weve kept the guild off balance chani said we want to avoid a showdown confrontation with our enemies alia said we have no special desire to kill them theres enough butchery going on under the atreides banner she feels it too paul thought strange what a sense of compelling responsibility they both felt for that brawling idolatrous universe with its ecstasies of tranquility and wild motion must we protect them from themselves he wondered they play with nothingness every moment empty lives empty words they ask too much of me his throat felt tight and full how many moments would he lose what sons what dreams was it worth the price his vision had revealed who would ask the living of some far distant future who would say to them but for muaddib you would not be here denying them their melange would solve nothing chani said so the guilds navigators would lose their ability to see into timespace your sisters of the bene gesserit would lose their truthsense some people might die before their time communication would break down who could be blamed they wouldnt let it come to that irulan said wouldnt they chani asked why not who could blame the guild theyd be helpless demonstrably so well sign the treaty as it stands paul said mlord stilgar said concentrating on his hands there is a question in our minds yes paul gave the old fremen his full attention you have certain powers stilgar said can you not locate the entente despite the guild powers paul thought stilgar couldnt just say youre prescient cant you trace a path in the future that leads to tupile paul looked at the golden surface of the table always the same problem how could he express the limits of the inexpressible should he speak of fragmentation the natural destiny of all power how could someone whod never experienced the spice change of prescience conceive an awareness containing no localized spacetime no personal imagevector nor associated sensory captives he looked at alia found her attention on irulan alia sensed his movement glanced at him nodded toward irulan ahhh yes any answer they gave would find its way into one of irulans special reports to the bene gesserit they never gave up seeking an answer to their kwisatz haderach stilgar though deserved an answer of some kind for that matter so did irulan the uninitiated try to conceive of prescience as obeying a natural law paul said he steepled his hands in front of him but itd be just as correct to say its heaven speaking to us that being able to read the future is a harmonious act of mans being in other words prediction is a natural consequence in the wave of the present it wears the guise of nature you see but such powers can not be used from an attitude that prestates aims and purposes does a chip caught in the wave say where its going theres no cause and effect in the oracle causes become occasions of convections and confluences places where the currents meet accepting prescience you fill your being with concepts repugnant to the intellect your intellectual consciousness therefore rejects them in rejecting intellect becomes a part of the processes and is subjugated you can not do it stilgar asked were i to seek tupile with prescience paul said speaking directly to irulan this might hide tupile chaos irulan protested it has no no consistency i did say it obeys no natural law paul said then there are limits to what you can see or do with your powers irulan asked before paul could answer alia said dear irulan prescience has no limits not consistent consistency isnt a necessary aspect of the universe but he said how can my brother give you explicit information about the limits of something which has no limits the boundaries escape the intellect that was a nasty thing for alia to do paul thought it would alarm irulan who had such a careful consciousness so dependent upon values derived from precise limits his gaze went to korba who sat in a pose of religious reverie listening with the soul how could the qizarate use this exchange more religious mystery something to evoke awe no doubt then youll sign the treaty in its present form stilgar asked paul smiled the issue of the oracle by stilgars judgment had been closed stilgar aimed only at victory not at discovering truth peace justice and a sound coinage these anchored stilgars universe he wanted something visible and real a signature on a treaty ill sign it paul said stilgar took up a fresh folder the latest communication from our field commanders in sector ixian speaks of agitation for a constitution the old fremen glanced at chani who shrugged irulan who had closed her eyes and put both hands to her forehead in mnemonic impressment opened her eyes studied paul intently the ixian confederacy offers submission stilgar said but their negotiators question the amount of the imperial tax which they they want a legal limit to my imperial will paul said who would govern me the landsraad or choam stilgar removed from the folder a note on instroy paper one of our agents sent this memorandum from a caucus of the choam minority he read the cipher in a flat voice the throne must be stopped in its attempt at a power monopoly we must tell the truth about the atreides how he maneuvers behind the triple sham of landsraad legislation religious sanction and bureaucratic efficiency he pushed the note back into the folder a constitution chani murmured paul glanced at her back to stilgar thus the jihad falters paul thought but not soon enough to save me the thought produced emotional tensions he remembered his earliest visions of the jihadtobe the terror and revulsion hed experienced now of course he knew visions of greater terrors he had lived with the real violence he had seen his fremen charged with mystical strength sweep all before them in the religious war the jihad gained a new perspective it was finite of course a brief spasm when measured against eternity but beyond lay horrors to overshadow anything in the past all in my name paul thought perhaps they could be given the form of a constitution chani suggested it neednt be actual deceit is a tool of statecraft irulan agreed there are limits to power as those who put their hopes in a constitution always discover paul said korba straightened from his reverent pose mlord yes and paul thought here now heres one who may harbor secret sympathies for an imagined rule of law we could begin with a religious constitution korba said something for the faithful who no paul snapped we will make this an order in council are you recording this irulan yes mlord irulan said voice frigid with dislike for the menial role he forced upon her constitutions become the ultimate tyranny paul said theyre organized power on such a scale as to be overwhelming the constitution is social power mobilized and it has no conscience it can crush the highest and the lowest removing all dignity and individuality it has an unstable balance point and no limitations i however have limitations in my desire to provide an ultimate protection for my people i forbid a constitution order in council this date etcetera etcetera what of the ixian concern about the tax mlord stilgar asked paul forced his attention away from the brooding angry look on korbas face said youve a proposal stil we must have control of taxes sire our price to the guild for my signature on the tupile treaty paul said is the submission of the ixian confederacy to our tax the confederacy can not trade without guild transport theyll pay very good mlord stilgar produced another folder cleared his throat the qizarates report on salusa secundus irulans father has been putting his legions through landing maneuvers irulan found something of interest in the palm of her left hand a pulse throbbed at her neck irulan paul asked do you persist in arguing that your fathers one legion is nothing more than a toy what could he do with only one legion she asked she stared at him out of slitted eyes he could get himself killed chani said paul nodded and id be blamed i know a few commanders in the jihad alia said whod pounce if they learned of this but its only his police force irulan protested then they have no need for landing maneuvers paul said i suggest that your next little note to your father contain a frank and direct discussion of my views about his delicate position she lowered her gaze yes mlord i hope that will be the end of it my father would make a good martyr mmmmmm paul said my sister wouldnt send a message to those commanders she mentioned unless i ordered it an attack on my father carries dangers other than the obvious military ones irulan said people are beginning to look back on his reign with a certain nostalgia youll go too far one day chani said in her deadly serious fremen voice enough paul ordered he weighed irulans revelation about public nostalgia ah now thatd carried a note of truth once more irulan had proved her worth the bene gesserit send a formal supplication stilgar said presenting another folder they wish to consult you about the preservation of your bloodline chani glanced sideways at the folder as though it contained a deadly device send the sisterhood the usual excuses paul said must we irulan demanded perhaps this is the time to discuss it chani said paul shook his head sharply they couldnt know that this was part of the price he had not yet decided to pay but chani wasnt to be stopped i have been to the prayer wall of sietch tabr where i was born she said i have submitted to doctors i have knelt in the desert and sent my thoughts into the depths where dwells shaihulud yet she shrugged nothing avails science and superstition all have failed her paul thought do i fail her too by not telling her what bearing an heir to house atreides will precipitate he looked up to find an expression of pity in alias eyes the idea of pity from his sister repelled him had she too seen that terrifying future my lord must know the dangers to his realm when he has no heir irulan said using her bene gesserit powers of voice with an oily persuasiveness these things are naturally difficult to discuss but they must be brought into the open an emperor is more than a man his figure leads the realm should he die without an heir civil strife must follow as you love your people you can not leave them thus paul pushed himself away from the table strode to the balcony windows a wind was flattening the smoke of the citys fires out there the sky presented a darkening silverblue softened by the evening fall of dust from the shield wall he stared southward at the escarpment which protected his northern lands from the coriolis wind and he wondered why his own peace of mind could find no such shield the council sat silently waiting behind him aware of how close to rage he was paul sensed time rushing upon him he tried to force himself into a tranquility of many balances where he might shape a new future disengage disengage disengage he thought what would happen if he took chani just picked up and left with her sought sanctuary on tupile his name would remain behind the jihad would find new and more terrible centers upon which to turn hed be blamed for that too he felt suddenly fearful that in reaching for any new thing he might let fall what was most precious that even the slightest noise from him might send the universe crashing back receding until he never could recapture any piece of it below him the square had become the setting for a band of pilgrims in the green and white of the hajj they wended their way like a disjointed snake behind a striding arrakeen guide they reminded paul that his reception hall would be packed with supplicants by now pilgrims their exercise in homelessness had become a disgusting source of wealth for his imperium the hajj filled the spaceways with religious tramps they came and they came and they came how did i set this in motion he asked himself it had of course set itself in motion it was in the genes which might labor for centuries to achieve this brief spasm driven by that deepest religious instinct the people came seeking their resurrection the pilgrimage ended here arrakis the place of rebirth the place to die snide old fremen said he wanted the pilgrims for their water what was it the pilgrims really sought paul wondered they said they came to a holy place but they must know the universe contained no edensource no tupile for the soul they called arrakis the place of the unknown where all mysteries were explained this was a link between their universe and the next and the frightening thing was that they appeared to go away satisfied what do they find here paul asked himself often in their religious ecstasy they filled the streets with screeching like some odd aviary in fact the fremen called them passage birds and the few who died here were winged souls with a sigh paul thought how each new planet his legions subjugated opened new sources of pilgrims they came out of gratitude for the peace of muaddib everywhere there is peace paul thought everywhere except in the heart of muaddib he felt that some element of himself lay immersed in frosty hoardarkness without end his prescient power had tampered with the image of the universe held by all mankind he had shaken the safe cosmos and replaced security with his jihad he had outfought and outthought and outpredicted the universe of men but a certainty filled him that this universe still eluded him this planet beneath him which he had commanded be remade from desert into a waterrich paradise it was alive it had a pulse as dynamic as that of any human it fought him resisted slipped away from his commands a hand crept into pauls he looked down to see chani peering up at him concern in her eyes those eyes drank him and she whispered please love do not battle with your ruhself an outpouring of emotion swept upward from her hand buoyed him sihaya he whispered we must go to the desert soon she said in a low voice he squeezed her hand released it returned to the table where he remained standing chani took her seat irulan stared at the papers in front of stilgar her mouth a tight line irulan proposes herself as mother of the imperial heir paul said he glanced at chani back to irulan who refused to meet his gaze we all know she holds no love for me irulan went very still i know the political arguments paul said its the human arguments which concern me i think if the princess consort were not bound by the commands of the bene gesserit if she did not seek this out of desires for personal power my reaction might be very different as matters stand though i reject this proposal irulan took a deep shaky breath paul resuming his seat thought he had never seen her under such poor control leaning toward her he said irulan i am truly sorry she lifted her chin a look of pure fury in her eyes i dont want your pity she hissed and turning to stilgar is there more thats urgent and dire holding his gaze firmly on paul stilgar said one more matter mlord the guild again proposes a formal embassy here on arrakis one of the deepspace kind korba asked his voice full of fanatic loathing presumably stilgar said a matter to be considered with the utmost care mlord korba warned the council of naibs would not like it an actual guildsman here on arrakis they contaminate the very ground they touch they live in tanks and dont touch the ground paul said letting his voice reveal irritation the naibs might take matters into their own hands mlord korba said paul glared at him they are fremen after all mlord korba insisted we well remember how the guild brought those who oppressed us we have not forgotten the way they blackmailed a spice ransom from us to keep our secrets from our enemies they drained us of every enough paul snapped do you think i have forgotten as though he had just awakened to the import of his own words korba stuttered unintelligibly then mlord forgive me i did not mean to imply you are not fremen i did not theyll send a steersman paul said it isnt likely a steersman would come here if he could see danger in it her mouth dry with sudden fear irulan said youve seen a steersman come here of course i havent seen a steersman paul said mimicking her tone but i can see where ones been and where ones going let them send us a steersman perhaps i have a use for such a one so ordered stilgar said and irulan hiding a smile behind her hand thought its true then our emperor can not see a steersman they are mutually blind the conspiracy is hidden once more the drama begins the emperor paul muaddib on his ascension to the lion throne alia peered down from her spy window into the great reception hall to watch the advance of the guild entourage the sharply silver light of noon poured through clerestory windows onto a floor worked in green blue and eggshell tiles to simulate a bayou with water plants and here and there a splash of exotic color to indicate bird or animal guildsmen moved across the tile pattern like hunters stalking their prey in a strange jungle they formed a moving design of gray robes black robes orange robes all arrayed in a deceptively random way around the transparent tank where the steersmanambassador swam in his orange gas the tank slid on its supporting field towed by two grayrobed attendants like a rectangular ship being warped into its dock directly beneath her paul sat on the lion throne on its raised dais he wore the new formal crown with its fish and fist emblems the jeweled golden robes of state covered his body the shimmering of a personal shield surrounded him two wings of bodyguards fanned out on both sides along the dais and down the steps stilgar stood two steps below pauls right hand in a white robe with a yellow rope for a belt sibling empathy told her that paul seethed with the same agitation she was experiencing although she doubted another could detect it his attention remained on an orangerobed attendant whose blindly staring metal eyes looked neither to right nor to left this attendant walked at the right front corner of the ambassadors troupe like a military outrider a rather flat face beneath curly black hair such of his figure as could be seen beneath the orange robe every gesture shouted a familiar identity it was duncan idaho it could not be duncan idaho yet it was captive memories absorbed in the womb during the moment of her mothers spice change identified this man for alia by a rihani decipherment which cut through all camouflage paul was seeing him she knew out of countless personal experiences out of gratitudes and youthful sharing it was duncan alia shuddered there could be only one answer this was a tleilaxu ghola a being reconstructed from the dead flesh of the original that original had perished saving paul this could only be a product of the axolotl tanks the ghola walked with the cockfooted alertness of a master swordsman he came to a halt as the ambassadors tank glided to a stop ten paces from the steps of the dais in the bene gesserit way she could not escape alia read pauls disquiet he no longer looked at the figure out of his past not looking his whole being stared muscles strained against restrictions as he nodded to the guild ambassador said i am told your name is edric we welcome you to our court in the hope this will bring new understanding between us the steersman assumed a sybaritic reclining pose in his orange gas popped a melange capsule into his mouth before meeting pauls gaze the tiny transducer orbiting a corner of the guildsmans tank reproduced a coughing sound then the rasping uninvolved voice i abase myself before my emperor and beg leave to present my credentials and offer a small gift an aide passed a scroll up to stilgar who studied it scowling then nodded to paul both stilgar and paul turned then toward the ghola standing patiently below the dais indeed my emperor has discerned the gift edric said we are pleased to accept your credentials paul said explain the gift edric rolled in the tank bringing his attention to bear on the ghola this is a man called hayt he said spelling the name according to our investigators he has a most curious history he was killed here on arrakis a grievous headwound which required many months of regrowth the body was sold to the bene tleilax as that of a master swordsman an adept of the ginaz school it came to our attention that this must be duncan idaho the trusted retainer of your household we bought him as a gift befitting an emperor edric peered up at paul is it not idaho sire restraint and caution gripped pauls voice he has the aspect of idaho does paul see something i dont alia wondered no its duncan the man called hayt stood impassively metal eyes fixed straight ahead body relaxed no sign escaped him to indicate he knew himself to be the object of discussion according to our best knowledge its idaho edric said hes called hayt now paul said a curious name sire theres no divining how or why the tleilaxu bestow names edric said but names can be changed the tleilaxu name is of little importance this is a tleilaxu thing paul thought theres the problem the bene tleilax held little attachment to phenomenal nature good and evil carried strange meanings in their philosophy what might they have incorporated in idahos flesh out of design or whim paul glanced at stilgar noted the fremens superstitious awe it was an emotion echoed all through his fremen guard stilgars mind would be speculating about the loathsome habits of guildsmen of tleilaxu and of gholas turning toward the ghola paul said hayt is that your only name a serene smile spread over the gholas dark features the metal eyes lifted centered on paul but maintained their mechanical stare that is how i am called my lord hayt in her dark spy hole alia trembled it was idahos voice a quality of sound so precise she sensed its imprint upon her cells may it please my lord the ghola added if i say his voice gives me pleasure this is a sign say the bene tleilax that i have heard the voice before but you dont know this for sure paul said i know nothing of my past for sure my lord it was explained that i can have no memory of my former life all that remains from before is the pattern set by the genes there are however niches into which once familiar things may fit there are voices places foods faces sounds actions a sword in my hand the controls of a thopter noting how intently the guildsmen watched this exchange paul asked do you understand that youre a gift it was explained to me my lord paul sat back hands resting on the arms of the throne what debt do i owe duncans flesh he wondered the man died saving my life but this is not idaho this is a ghola yet here were body and mind which had taught paul to fly a thopter as though the wings grew from his own shoulders paul knew he could not pick up a sword without leaning on the harsh education idaho had given him a ghola this was flesh full of false impressions easily misread old associations would persist duncan idaho it wasnt so much a mask the ghola wore as it was a loose concealing garment of personality which moved in a way different from whatever the tleilaxu had hidden here how might you serve us paul asked in any way my lords wishes and my capabilities agree alia watching from her vantage point was touched by the gholas air of diffidence she detected nothing feigned something ultimately innocent shone from the new duncan idaho the original had been worldly devilmaycare but this flesh had been cleansed of all that it was a pure surface upon which the tleilaxu had written what she sensed the hidden perils in this gift then this was a tleilaxu thing the tleilaxu displayed a disturbing lack of inhibitions in what they created unbridled curiosity might guide their actions they boasted they could make anything from the proper human raw material devils or saints they sold killermentats theyd produced a killer medic overcoming the suk inhibitions against the taking of human life to do it their wares included willing menials pliant sex toys for any whim soldiers generals philosophers even an occasional moralist paul stirred looked at edric how has this gift been trained he asked if it please my lord edric said it amused the tleilaxu to train this ghola as a mentat and philosopher of the zensunni thus they sought to increase his abilities with the sword did they succeed i do not know my lord paul weighed the answer truthsense told him edric sincerely believed the ghola to be idaho but there was more the waters of time through which this oracular steersman moved suggested dangers without revealing them hayt the tleilaxu name spoke of peril paul felt himself tempted to reject the gift even as he felt the temptation he knew he couldnt choose that way this flesh made demands on house atreides a fact the enemy well knew zensunni philosopher paul mused once more looking at the ghola youve examined your own role and motives i approach my service in an attitude of humility sire i am a cleansed mind washed free of the imperatives from my human past would you prefer we called you hayt or duncan idaho my lord may call me what he wishes for i am not a name but do you enjoy the name duncan idaho i think that was my name sire it fits within me yet it stirs up curious responses ones name i think must carry much thats unpleasant along with the pleasant what gives you the most pleasure paul asked unexpectedly the ghola laughed said looking for signs in others which reveal my former self do you see such signs here oh yes my lord your man stilgar there is caught between suspicion and admiration he was friend to my former self but this ghola flesh repels him you my lord admired the man i was and you trusted him cleansed mind paul said how can a cleansed mind put itself in bondage to us bondage my lord the cleansed mind makes decisions in the presence of unknowns and without cause and effect is this bondage paul scowled it was a zensunni saying cryptic apt immersed in a creed which denied objective function in all mental activity without cause and effect such thoughts shocked the mind unknowns unknowns lay in every decision even in the oracular vision youd prefer we called you duncan idaho paul asked we live by differences my lord choose a name for me let your tleilaxu name stand paul said hayt theres a name inspires caution hayt bowed moved back one step and alia wondered how did he know the interview was over i knew it because i know my brother but there was no sign a stranger could read did the duncan idaho in him know paul turned toward the ambassador said quarters have been set aside for your embassy it is our desire to have a private consultation with you at the earliest opportunity we will send for you let us inform you further before you hear it from an inaccurate source that a reverend mother of the sisterhood gaius helen mohiam has been removed from the heighliner which brought you it was done at our command her presence on your ship will be an item in our talks a wave of pauls left hand dismissed the envoy hayt paul said stay here the ambassadors attendants backed away towing the tank edric became orange motion in orange gas eyes a mouth gently waving limbs paul watched until the last guildsman was gone the great doors swinging closed behind them ive done it now paul thought ive accepted the ghola the tleilaxu creation was bait no doubt of it very likely the old hag of a reverend mother played the same role but it was the time of the tarot which hed forecast in an early vision the damnable tarot it muddied the waters of time until the prescient strained to detect moments but an hour off many a fish took the bait and escaped he reminded himself and the tarot worked for him as well as against him what he could not see others might not detect as well the ghola stood head cocked to one side waiting stilgar moved across the steps hid the ghola from pauls view in chakobsa the hunting language of their sietch days stilgar said that creature in the tank gives me the shudders sire but this gift send it away in the same tongue paul said i can not idahos dead stilgar argued this isnt idaho let me take its water for the tribe the ghola is my problem stil your problem is our prisoner i want the reverend mother guarded most carefully by the men i trained to resist the wiles of voice i like this not sire ill be cautious stil see that you are too very well sire stilgar stepped down to the floor of the hall passed close to hayt sniffed him and strode out evil can be detected by its smell paul thought stilgar had planted the green and white atreides banner on a dozen worlds but remained superstitious fremen proof against any sophistication paul studied the gift duncan duncan he whispered what have they done to you they gave me life mlord hayt said but why were you trained and given to us paul asked hayt pursed his lips then they intend me to destroy you the statements candor shook paul but then how else could a zensunnimentat respond even in a ghola a mentat could speak no less than the truth especially out of zensunni inner calm this was a human computer mind and nervous system fitted to the tasks relegated long ago to hated mechanical devices to condition him also as a zensunni meant a double ration of honesty unless the tleilaxu had built something even more odd into this flesh why for example the mechanical eyes tleilaxu boasted their metal eyes improved on the original strange then that more tleilaxu didnt wear them out of choice paul glanced up at alias spy hole longed for her presence and advice for counsel not clouded by feelings of responsibility and debt once more he looked at the ghola this was no frivolous gift it gave honest answers to dangerous questions it makes no difference that i know this is a weapon to be used against me paul thought what should i do to protect myself from you paul asked it was direct speech no royal we but a question as he might have put it to the old duncan idaho send me away mlord paul shook his head from side to side how are you to destroy me hayt looked at the guards whod moved closer to paul after stilgars departure he turned cast his gaze around the hall brought his metal eyes back to bear on paul nodded this is a place where a man draws away from people hayt said it speaks of such power that one can contemplate it comfortably only in the remembrance that all things are finite did my lords oracular powers plot his course into this place paul drummed his fingers against the thrones arms the mentat sought data but the question disturbed him i came to this position by strong decisions not always out of my other abilities strong decisions hayt said these temper a mans life one can take the temper from fine metal by heating it and allowing it to cool without quenching do you divert me with zensunni prattle paul asked zensunni has other avenues to explore sire than diversion and display paul wet his lips with his tongue drew in a deep breath set his own thoughts into the counterbalance poise of the mentat negative answers arose around him it wasnt expected that hed go haring after the ghola to the exclusion of other duties no that wasnt it why a zensunnimentat philosophy words contemplation inward searching he felt the weakness of his data we need more data he muttered the facts needed by a mentat do not brush off onto one as you might gather pollen on your robe while passing through a field of flowers hayt said one chooses his pollen carefully examines it under powerful amplification you must teach me this zensunni way with rhetoric paul said the metallic eyes glittered at him for a moment then mlord perhaps thats what was intended to blunt my will with words and ideas paul wondered ideas are most to feared when they become actions paul said send me away sire hayt said and it was duncan idahos voice full of concern for the young master paul felt trapped by that voice he couldnt send that voice away even when it came from a ghola you will stay he said and well both exercise caution hayt bowed in submission paul glanced up at the spy hole eyes pleading for alia to take this gift off his hands and ferret out its secrets gholas were ghosts to frighten children hed never thought to know one to know this one he had to set himself above all compassion and he wasnt certain he could do it duncan duncan where was idaho in this shapedtomeasure flesh it wasnt flesh it was a shroud in fleshly shape idaho lay dead forever on the floor of an arrakeen cavern his ghost stared out of metal eyes two beings stood side by side in this revenant flesh one was a threat with its force and nature hidden behind unique veils closing his eyes paul allowed old visions to sift through his awareness he sensed the spirits of love and hate spouting there in a rolling sea from which no rock lifted above the chaos no place at all from which to survey turmoil why has no vision shown me this new duncan idaho he asked himself what concealed time from an oracle other oracles obviously paul opened his eyes asked hayt do you have the power of prescience no mlord sincerity spoke in that voice it was possible the ghola didnt know he possessed this ability of course but thatd hamper his working as a mentat what was the hidden design old visions surged around paul would he have to choose the terrible way distorted time hinted at this ghola in that hideous future would that way close in upon him no matter what he did disengage disengage disengage the thought tolled in his mind in her position above paul alia sat with chin cupped in left hand stared down at the ghola a magnetic attraction about this hayt reached up to her tleilaxu restoration had given him youth an innocent intensity which called out to her shed understood pauls unspoken plea when oracles failed one turned to real spies and physical powers she wondered though at her own eagerness to accept this challenge she felt a positive desire to be near this new man perhaps to touch him hes a danger to both of us she thought truth suffers from too much analysis ancient fremen saying reverend mother i shudder to see you in such circumstances irulan said she stood just inside the cell door measuring the various capacities of the room in her bene gesserit way it was a threemeter cube carved with cutterays from the veined brown rock beneath pauls keep for furnishings it contained one flimsy basket chair occupied now by the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam a pallet with a brown cover upon which had been spread a deck of the new dune tarot cards a metered water tap above a reclamation basin a fremen privy with moisture seals it was all sparse primitive yellow light came from anchored and caged glowglobes at the four corners of the ceiling youve sent word to the lady jessica the reverend mother asked yes but i dont expect her to lift one finger against her firstborn irulan said she glanced at the cards they spoke of the powerful turning their backs on supplicants the card of the great worm lay beneath desolate sand patience was counseled did one require the tarot to see this she asked herself a guard stood outside watching them through a metaglass window in the door irulan knew thered be other monitors on this encounter she had put in much thought and planning before daring to come here to have stayed away carried its own perils though the reverend mother had been engaged in prajna meditation interspersed with examinations of the tarot despite a feeling that she would never leave arrakis alive she had achieved a measure of calm through this ones oracular powers might be small but muddy water was muddy water and there was always the litany against fear she had yet to assimilate the import of the actions which had precipitated her into this cell dark suspicions brooded in her mind and the tarot hinted at confirmations was it possible the guild had planned this a yellowrobed qizara head shaved for a turban beady eyes of total blue in a bland round face skin leathered by the wind and sun of arrakis had awaited her on the heighliners reception bridge he had looked up from a bulb of spicecoffee being served by an obsequious steward studied her a moment put down the coffee bulb you are the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam to replay those words in her mind was to bring that moment alive in the memory her throat had constricted with an unmanageable spasm of fear how had one of the emperors minions learned of her presence on the heighliner it came to our attention that you were aboard the qizara said have you forgotten that you are denied permission to set foot on the holy planet i am not on arrakis she said im a passenger on a guild heighliner in free space there is no such thing as free space madame she read hate mingled with profound suspicion in his tone muaddib rules everywhere he said arrakis is not my destination she insisted arrakis is the destination of everyone he said and she feared for a moment that he would launch into a recital of the mystical itinerary which pilgrims followed this very ship had carried thousands of them but the qizara had pulled a golden amulet from beneath his robe kissed it touched it to his forehead and placed it to his right ear listened presently he restored the amulet to its hidden place you are ordered to gather your luggage and accompany me to arrakis but i have business elsewhere in that moment she suspected guild perfidy or exposure through some transcendent power of the emperor or his sister perhaps the steersman did not conceal the conspiracy after all the abomination alia certainly possessed the abilities of a bene gesserit reverend mother what happened when those powers were coupled with the forces which worked in her brother at once the qizara snapped everything in her cried out against setting foot once more on that accursed desert planet here was where the lady jessica had turned against the sisterhood here was where theyd lost paul atreides the kwisatz haderach theyd sought through long generations of careful breeding at once she agreed theres little time the qizara said when the emperor commands all his subjects obey so the order had come from paul she thought of protesting to the heighliners navigatorcommander but the futility of such a gesture stopped her what could the guild do the emperor has said i must die if i set foot on dune she said making a last desperate effort you spoke of this yourself you are condemning me if you take me down there say no more the qizara ordered the thing is ordained that was how they always spoke of imperial commands she knew ordained the holy ruler whose eyes could pierce the future had spoken what must be must be he had seen it had he not with the sick feeling that she was caught in a web of her own spinning she had turned to obey and the web had become a cell which irulan could visit she saw that irulan had aged somewhat since their meeting on wallach ix new lines of worry spread from the corners of her eyes well time to see if this sister of the bene gesserit could obey her vows ive had worse quarters the reverend mother said do you come from the emperor and she allowed her fingers to move as though in agitation irulan read the moving fingers and her own fingers flashed an answer as she spoke saying no i came as soon as i heard you were here wont the emperor be angry the reverend mother asked again her fingers moved imperative pressing demanding let him be angry you were my teacher in the sisterhood just as you were the teacher of his own mother does he think i will turn my back on you as she has done and irulans fingertalk made excuses begged the reverend mother sighed on the surface it was the sigh of a prisoner bemoaning her fate but inwardly she felt the response as a comment on irulan it was futile to hope the atreides emperors precious gene pattern could be preserved through this instrument no matter her beauty this princess was flawed under that veneer of sexual attraction lived a whining shrew more interested in words than in actions irulan was still a bene gesserit though and the sisterhood reserved certain techniques to use on some of its weaker vessels as insurance that vital instructions would be carried out beneath small talk about a softer pallet better food the reverend mother brought up her arsenal of persuasion and gave her orders the brothersister crossbreeding must be explored irulan almost broke at receiving this command i must have my chance irulans fingers pleaded youve had your chance the reverend mother countered and she was explicit in her instructions was the emperor ever angry with his concubine his unique powers must make him lonely to whom could he speak in any hope of being understood to the sister obviously she shared this loneliness the depth of their communion must be exploited opportunities must be created to throw them together in privacy intimate encounters must be arranged the possibility of eliminating the concubine must be explored grief dissolved traditional barriers irulan protested if chani were killed suspicion would fasten immediately upon the princessconsort besides there were other problems chani had fastened upon an ancient fremen diet supposed to promote fertility and the diet eliminated all opportunity for administering the contraceptive drugs lifting the suppressives would make chani even more fertile the reverend mother was outraged and concealed it with difficulty while her fingers flashed their demands why had this information not been conveyed at the beginning of their conversation how could irulan be that stupid if chani conceived and bore a son the emperor would declare the child his heir irulan protested that she understood the dangers but the genes might not be totally lost damn such stupidity the reverend mother raged who knew what suppressions and genetic entanglements chani might introduce from her wild fremen strain the sisterhood must have only the pure line and an heir would renew pauls ambitions spur him to new efforts in consolidating his empire the conspiracy could not afford such a setback defensively irulan wanted to know how she could have prevented chani from trying this diet but the reverend mother was in no mood for excuses irulan received explicit instructions now to meet this new threat if chani conceived an abortifact must be introduced into her food or drink either that or she must be killed an heir to the throne from that source must be prevented at all costs an abortifact would be as dangerous as an open attack on the concubine irulan objected she trembled at the thought of trying to kill chani was irulan deterred by danger the reverend mother wanted to know her fingertalk conveying deep scorn angered irulan signaled that she knew her value as an agent in the royal household did the conspiracy wish to waste such a valuable agent was she to be thrown away in what other way could they keep this close a watch on the emperor or had they introduced another agent into the household was that it was she to be used now desperately and for the last time in a war all values acquired new relationships the reverend mother countered their greatest peril was that house atreides should secure itself with an imperial line the sisterhood could not take such a risk this went far beyond the danger to the atreides genetic pattern let paul anchor his family to the throne and the sisterhood could look forward to centuries of disruption for its programs irulan understood the argument but she couldnt escape the thought that a decision had been made to spend the princessconsort for something of great value was there something she should know about the ghola irulan ventured the reverend mother wanted to know if irulan thought the sisterhood composed of fools when had they ever failed to tell irulan all she should know it was no answer but an admission of concealment irulan saw it said she would be told no more than she needed to know how could they be certain the ghola was capable of destroying the emperor irulan asked she could just as well have asked if melange were capable of destruction the reverend mother countered it was a rebuke with a subtle message irulan realized the bene gesserit whip that instructs informed her that she should have understood long ago this similarity between the spice and the ghola melange was valuable but it exacted a price addiction it added years to a life decades for some but it was still just another way to die the ghola was something of deadly value the obvious way to prevent an unwanted birth was to kill the prospective mother before conception the reverend mother signaled returning to the attack of course irulan thought if you decide to spend a certain sum get as much for it as you can the reverend mothers eyes dark with the blue brilliance of her melange addiction stared up at irulan measuring waiting observing minutiae she reads me clearly irulan thought with dismay she trained me and observed me in that training she knows i realize what decision has been taken here she only observes now to see how i will take this knowledge well i will take it as a bene gesserit and a princess irulan managed a smile pulled herself erect thought of the evocative opening passage of the litany against fear i must not fear fear is the mindkiller fear is the littledeath that brings total obliteration i will face my fear when calmness had returned she thought let them spend me i will show them what a princess is worth perhaps ill buy them more than they expected after a few more empty vocalizations to bind off the interview irulan departed when she had gone the reverend mother returned to her tarot cards laying them out in the fireeddy pattern immediately she got the kwisatz haderach of the major arcana and the card lay coupled with the eight of ships the sibyl hoodwinked and betrayed these were not cards of good omen they spoke of concealed resources for her enemies she turned away from the cards sat in agitation wondering if irulan might yet destroy them the fremen see her as the earth figure a demigoddess whose special charge is to protect the tribes through her powers of violence she is reverend mother to their reverend mothers to pilgrims who seek her out with demands that she restore virility or make the barren fruitful she is a form of antimentat she feeds on that proof that the analytic has limits she represents ultimate tension she is the virginharlot witty vulgar cruel as destructive in her whims as a coriolis storm st alia of the knife as taken from the irulan report alia stood like a blackrobed sentinel figure on the south platform of her temple the fane of the oracle which pauls fremen cohorts had built for her against a wall of his stronghold she hated this part of her life but knew no way to evade the temple without bringing down destruction upon them all the pilgrims damn them grew more numerous every day the temples lower porch was crowded with them vendors moved among the pilgrims and there were minor sorcerers haruspices diviners all working their trade in pitiful imitation of paul muaddib and his sister red and green packages containing the new dune tarot were prominent among the vendors wares alia saw she wondered about the tarot who was feeding this device into the arrakeen market why had the tarot sprung to prominence at this particular time and place was it to muddy time spice addiction always conveyed some sensitivity to prediction fremen were notoriously fey was it an accident that so many of them dabbled in portents and omens here and now she decided to seek an answer at the first opportunity there was a wind from the southeast a small leftover wind blunted by the scarp of the shield wall which loomed high in these northern reaches the rim glowed orange through a thin dust haze underlighted by the late afternoon sun it was a hot wind against her cheeks and it made her homesick for the sand for the security of open spaces the last of the days mob began descending the broad greenstone steps of the lower porch singly and in groups a few pausing to stare at the keepsakes and holy amulets on the street vendors racks some consulting one last minor sorcerer pilgrims supplicants townfolk fremen vendors closing up for the day they formed a straggling line that trailed off into the palmlined avenue which led to the heart of the city alias eyes picked out the fremen marking the frozen looks of superstitious awe on their faces the halfwild way they kept their distance from the others they were her strength and her peril they still captured giant worms for transport for sport and for sacrifice they resented the offworld pilgrims barely tolerated the townfolk of graben and pan hated the cynicism they saw in the street vendors one did not jostle a wild fremen even in a mob such as the ones which swarmed to alias fane there were no knifings in the sacred precincts but bodies had been found later the departing swarm had stirred up dust the flinty odor came to alias nostrils ignited another pang of longing for the open bled her sense of the past she realized had been sharpened by the coming of the ghola thered been much pleasure in those untrammeled days before her brother had mounted the throne time for joking time for small things time to enjoy a cool morning or a sunset time time time even danger had been good in those days clean danger from known sources no need then to strain the limits of prescience to peer through murky veils for frustrating glimpses of the future wild fremen said it well four things can not be hidden love smoke a pillar of fire and a man striding across the open bled with an abrupt feeling of revulsion alia retreated from the platform into the shadows of the fane strode along the balcony which looked down into the glistening opalescence of her hall of oracles sand on the tiles rasped beneath her feet supplicants always tracked sand into the sacred chambers she ignored attendants guards postulants the qizarates omnipresent priestsycophants plunged into the spiral passage which twisted upward to her private quarters there amidst divans deep rugs tent hangings and mementos of the desert she dismissed the fremen amazons stilgar had assigned as her personal guardians watchdogs more likely when they had gone muttering and objecting but more fearful of her than they were of stilgar she stripped off her robe leaving only the sheathed crysknife on its thong around her neck strewed garments behind as she made for the bath he was near she knew that shadowfigure of a man she could sense in her future but could not see it angered her that no power of prescience could put flesh on that figure he could be sensed only at unexpected moments while she scanned the lives of others or she came upon a smoky outline in solitary darkness when innocence lay coupled with desire he stood just beyond an unfixed horizon and she felt that if she strained her talents to an unexpected intensity she might see him he was there a constant assault on her awareness fierce dangerous immoral moist warm air surrounded her in the tub here was a habit she had learned from the memoryentities of the uncounted reverend mothers who were strung out in her awareness like pearls on a glowing necklace water warm water in a sunken tub accepted her skin as she slid into it green tiles with figures of red fish worked into a sea pattern surrounded the water such an abundance of water occupied this space that a fremen of old would have been outraged to see it used merely for washing human flesh he was near it was lust in tension with chastity she thought her flesh desired a mate sex held no casual mystery for a reverend mother who had presided at the sietch orgies the tau awareness of her otherselves could supply any detail her curiosity required this feeling of nearness could be nothing other than flesh reaching for flesh need for action fought lethargy in the warm water abruptly alia climbed dripping from the bath strode wet and naked into the training chamber which adjoined her bedroom the chamber oblong and skylighted contained the gross and subtle instruments which toned a bene gesserit adept into ultimate physical and mental awareness preparedness there were mnemonic amplifiers digit mills from lx to strengthen and sensitize fingers and toes odor synthesizers tactility sensitizers temperature gradient fields pattern betrayers to prevent her falling into detectable habits alphawaveresponse trainers blinksynchronizers to tone abilities in light dark spectrum analysis in tencentimeter letters along one wall written by her own hand in mnemonic paint stood the key reminder from the bene gesserit creed before us all methods of learning were tainted by instinct we learned how to learn before us instinctridden researchers possessed a limited attention span often no longer than a single lifetime projects stretching across fifty or more lifetimes never occurred to them the concept of total muscle nerve training had not entered awareness as she moved into the training room alia caught her own reflection multiplied thousands of times in the crystal prisms of a fencing mirror swinging in the heart of a target dummy she saw the long sword waiting on its brackets against the target and she thought yes ill work myself to exhaustion drain the flesh and clear the mind the sword felt right in her hand she slipped the crysknife from its sheath at her neck held it sinister tapped the activating stud with the sword tip resistance came alive as the aura of the target shield built up pushing her weapon slowly and firmly away prisms glittered the target slipped to her left alia followed with the tip of the long blade thinking as she often did that the thing could almost be alive but it was only servomotors and complex reflector circuits designed to lure the eyes away from danger to confuse and teach it was an instrument geared to react as she reacted an antiself which moved as she moved balancing light on its prisms shifting its target offering its counterblade many blades appeared to lunge at her from the prisms but only one was real she countered the real one slipped the sword past shield resistance to tap the target a marker light came alive red and glistening among the prisms more distraction again the thing attacked moving at onemarker speed now just a bit faster than it had at the beginning she parried and against all caution moved into the danger zone scored with the crysknife two lights glowed from the prisms again the thing increased speed moving out on its rollers drawn like a magnet to the motions of her body and the tip of her sword attack parry counter attack parry counter she had four lights alive in there now and the thing was becoming more dangerous moving faster with each light offering more areas of confusion five lights sweat glistened on her naked skin she existed now in a universe whose dimensions were outlined by the threatening blade the target bare feet against the practice floor senses nerves muscles motion against motion attack parry counter six lights seven eight she had never before risked eight in a recess of her mind there grew a sense of urgency a crying out against such wildness as this the instrument of prisms and target could not think feel caution or remorse and it carried a real blade to go against less defeated the purpose of such training that attacking blade could maim and it could kill but the finest swordsmen in the imperium never went against more than seven lights nine alia experienced a sense of supreme exaltation attacking blade and target became blurs among blurs she felt that the sword in her hand had come alive she was an antitarget she did not move the blade it moved her ten eleven something flashed past her shoulder slowed at the shield aura around the target slid through and tripped the deactivating stud the lights darkened prisms and target twisted their way to stillness alia whirled angered by the intrusion but her reaction was thrown into tension by awareness of the supreme ability which had hurled that knife it had been a throw timed to exquisite nicety just fast enough to get through the shield zone and not too fast to be deflected and it had touched a onemillimeter spot within an elevenlight target alia found her own emotions and tensions running down in a manner not unlike that of the target dummy she was not at all surprised to see who had thrown the knife paul stood just inside the training room doorway stilgar three steps behind him her brothers eyes were squinted in anger alia growing conscious of her nudity thought to cover herself found the idea amusing what the eyes had seen could not be erased slowly she replaced the crysknife in its sheath at her neck i mightve known she said i presume you know how dangerous that was paul said he took his time reading the reactions on her face and body the flush of her exertions coloring her skin the wet fullness of her lips there was a disquieting femaleness about her that he had never considered in his sister he found it odd that he could look at a person who was this close to him and no longer recognize her in the identity framework which had seemed so fixed and familiar that was madness stilgar rasped coming up to stand beside paul the words were angry but alia heard awe in his voice saw it in his eyes eleven lights paul said shaking his head id have made it twelve if you hadnt interfered she said she began to pale under his close regard added and why do the damned things have that many lights if were not supposed to try for them a bene gesserit should ask the reasoning behind an openended system paul asked i suppose you never tried for more than seven she said anger returning his attentive posture began to annoy her just once paul said gurney halleck caught me on ten my punishment was sufficiently embarrassing that i wont tell you what he did and speaking of embarrassment next time perhaps youll have yourselves announced she said she brushed past paul into the bedroom found a loose gray robe slipped into it began brushing her hair before a wall mirror she felt sweaty sad a postcoitus kind of sadness that left her with a desire to bathe once more and to sleep whyre you here she asked my lord stilgar said there was an odd inflection in his voice that brought alia around to stare at him were here at irulans suggestion paul said as strange as that may seem she believes and information in stils possession appears to confirm it that our enemies are about to make a major try for my lord stilgar said his voice sharper as her brother turned questioning alia continued to look at the old fremen naib something about him now made her intensely aware that he was one of the primitives stilgar believed in a supernatural world very near him it spoke to him in a simple pagan tongue dispelling all doubts the natural universe in which he stood was fierce unstoppable and it lacked the common morality of the imperium yes stil paul said do you want to tell her why we came this isnt the time to talk of why we came stilgar said whats wrong stil stilgar continued to stare at alia sire are you blind paul turned back to his sister a feeling of unease beginning to fill him of all his aides only stilgar dared speak to him in that tone but even stilgar measured the occasion by its need this one must have a mate stilgar blurted therell be trouble if shes not wed and that soon alia whirled away her face suddenly hot how did he touch me she wondered bene gesserit selfcontrol had been powerless to prevent her reaction how had stilgar done that he hadnt the power of the voice she felt dismayed and angry listen to the great stilgar alia said keeping her back to them aware of a shrewish quality in her voice and unable to hide it advice to maidens from stilgar the fremen as i love you both i must speak stilgar said a profound dignity in his tone i did not become a chieftain among the fremen by being blind to what moves men and women together one needs no mysterious powers for this paul weighed stilgars meaning reviewed what they had seen here and his own undeniable male reaction to his own sister yes thered been a ruttish air about alia something wildly wanton what had made her enter the practice floor in the nude and risking her life in that foolhardy way eleven lights in the fencing prisms that brainless automaton loomed in his mind with all the aspects of an ancient horror creature its possession was the shibboleth of this age but it carried also the taint of old immorality once theyd been guided by an artificial intelligence computer brains the butlerian jihad had ended that but it hadnt ended the aura of aristocratic vice which enclosed such things stilgar was right of course they must find a mate for alia i will see to it paul said alia and i will discuss this later privately alia turned around focused on paul knowing how his mind worked she realized shed been the subject of a mentat decision uncounted bits falling together in that humancomputer analysis there was an inexorable quality to this realization a movement like the movement of planets it carried something of the order of the universe in it inevitable and terrifying sire stilgar said perhaps wed not now paul snapped weve other problems at the moment aware that she dared not try to match logic with her brother alia put the past few moments aside bene gesserit fashion said irulan sent you she found herself experiencing menace in that thought indirectly paul said the information she gives us confirms our suspicion that the guild is about to try for a sandworm theyll try to capture a small one and attempt to start the spice cycle on some other world stilgar said it means theyve found a world they consider suitable it means they have fremen accomplices alia argued no offworlder could capture a worm that goes without saying stilgar said no it doesnt alia said she was outraged by such obtuseness paul certainly you the rot is setting in paul said weve known that for quite some time ive never seen this other world though and that bothers me if they that bothers you alia demanded it means only that theyve clouded its location with steersmen the way they hide their sanctuaries stilgar opened his mouth closed it without speaking he had the overwhelming sensation that his idols had admitted blasphemous weakness paul sensing stilgars disquiet said weve an immediate problem i want your opinion alia stilgar suggests we expand our patrols in the open bled and reinforce the sietch watch its just possible we could spot a landing party and prevent the with a steersman guiding them alia asked they are desperate arent they paul agreed that is why im here whatve they seen that we havent alia asked precisely alia nodded remembering her thoughts about the new dune tarot quickly she recounted her fears throwing a blanket over us paul said with adequate patrols stilgar ventured we might prevent the we prevent nothing forever alia said she didnt like the feel of the way stilgars mind was working now he had narrowed his scope eliminated obvious essentials this was not the stilgar she remembered we must count on their getting a worm paul said whether they can start the melange cycle on another planet is a different question theyll need more than a worm stilgar looked from brother to sister out of ecological thinking that had been ground into him by sietch life he grasped their meaning a captive worm couldnt live except within a bit of arrakis sand plankton little makers and all the guilds problem was large but not impossible his own growing uncertainty lay in a different area then your visions do not detect the guild at its work he asked damnation paul exploded alia studied stilgar sensing the savage sideshow of ideas taking place in his mind he was hung on a rack of enchantment magic magic to glimpse the future was to steal terrifying fire from a sacred flame it held the attraction of ultimate peril souls ventured and lost one brought back from the formless dangerous distances something with form and power but stilgar was beginning to sense other forces perhaps greater powers beyond that unknown horizon his queen witch and sorcerer friend betrayed dangerous weaknesses stilgar alia said fighting to hold him you stand in a valley between dunes i stand on the crest i see where you do not see and among other things i see mountains which conceal the distances there are things hidden from you stilgar said this youve always said all power is limited alia said and danger may come from behind the mountains stilgar said its something on that order alia said stilgar nodded his gaze fastened on pauls face but whatever comes from behind the mountains must cross the dunes the most dangerous game in the universe is to govern from an oracular base we do not consider ourselves wise enough or brave enough to play that game the measures detailed here for regulation in lesser matters are as near as we dare venture to the brink of government for our purposes we borrow a definition from the bene gesserit and we consider the various worlds as gene pools sources of teachings and teachers sources of the possible our goal is not to rule but to tap these gene pools to learn and to free ourselves from all restraints imposed by dependency and government the orgy as a tool of statecraft chapter three of the steersmans guild is that where your father died edric asked sending a beam pointer from his tank to a jeweled marker on one of the relief maps adorning a wall of pauls reception salon thats the shrine of his skull paul said my father died a prisoner on a harkonnen frigate in the sink below us oh yes i recall the story now edric said something about killing the old baron harkonnen his mortal enemy hoping he didnt betray too much of the terror which small enclosures such as this room imposed upon him edric rolled over in the orange gas directed his gaze at paul who sat alone on a long divan of striped gray and black my sister killed the baron paul said voice and manner dry just before the battle of arrakeen and why he wondered did the guild manfish reopen old wounds in this place and at this time the steersman appeared to be fighting a losing battle to contain his nervous energies gone were the languid fish motions of their earlier encounter edrics tiny eyes jerked here there questing and measuring the one attendant who had accompanied him in here stood apart near the line of houseguards ranging the end wall at pauls left the attendant worried paul hulking thicknecked blunt and vacant face the man had entered the salon nudging edrics tank along on its supporting field walking with a stranglers gait arms akimbo scytale edric had called him scytale an aide the aides surface shouted stupidity but the eyes betrayed him they laughed at everything they saw your concubine appeared to enjoy the performance of the face dancers edric said it pleases me that i could provide that small entertainment i particularly enjoyed her reaction to seeing her own features simultaneously repeated by the whole troupe isnt there a warning against guildsmen bearing gifts paul asked and he thought of the performance out there in the great hall the dancers had entered in the costumes and guise of the dune tarot flinging themselves about in seemingly random patterns that devolved into fire eddies and ancient prognostic designs then had come the rulers a parade of kings and emperors like faces on coins formal and stiff in outline but curiously fluid and the jokes a copy of pauls own face and body chani repeated across the floor of the hall even stilgar who had grunted and shuddered while others laughed but our gifts have the kindest intent edric protested how kindly can you be paul asked the ghola you gave us believes he was designed to destroy us destroy you sire edric asked all bland attention can one destroy a god stilgar entering on the last words stopped glared at the guards they were much farther from paul than he liked angrily he motioned them closer its all right stil paul said lifting a hand just a friendly discussion why dont you move the ambassadors tank over by the end of my divan stilgar weighing the order saw that it would put the steersmans tank between paul and the hulking aide much too close to paul but its all right stil paul repeated and he gave the private handsignal which made the order an imperative moving with obvious reluctance stilgar pushed the tank closer to paul he didnt like the feel of the container or the heavily perfumed smell of melange around it he took up a position at the corner of the tank beneath the orbiting device through which the steersman spoke to kill a god paul said thats very interesting but who says im a god those who worship you edric said glancing pointedly at stilgar is this what you believe paul asked what i believe is of no moment sire edric said it seems to most observers however that you conspire to make a god of yourself and one might ask if that is something any mortal can do safely paul studied the guildsman repellent creature but perceptive it was a question paul had asked himself time and again but he had seen enough alternate timelines to know of worse possibilities than accepting godhead for himself much worse these were not however the normal avenues for a steersman to probe curious why had that question been asked what could edric hope to gain by such effrontery pauls thoughts went flick the association of tleilaxu would be behind this move flick the jihads recent sembou victory would bear on edrics action flick various bene gesserit credos showed themselves here flick a process involving thousands of information bits poured flickering through his computational awareness it required perhaps three seconds does a steersman question the guidelines of prescience paul asked putting edric on the weakest ground this disturbed the steersman but he covered well coming up with what sounded like a long aphorism no man of intelligence questions the fact of prescience sire oracular vision has been known to men since most ancient times it has a way of entangling us when we least suspect luckily there are other forces in our universe greater than prescience paul asked pressing him if prescience alone existed and did everything sire it would annihilate itself nothing but prescience where could it be applied except to its own degenerating movements theres always the human situation paul agreed a precarious thing at best edric said without confusing it by hallucinations are my visions no more than hallucinations paul asked mock sadness in his voice or do you imply that my worshippers hallucinate stilgar sensing the mounting tensions moved a step nearer paul fixed his attention on the guildsman reclining in the tank you twist my words sire edric protested an odd sense of violence lay suspended in the words violence here paul wondered they wouldnt dare unless and he glanced at his guards the forces which protected him were to be used in replacing him but you accuse me of conspiring to make a god of myself paul said pitching his voice that only edric and stilgar might hear conspire a poor choice of words perhaps my lord edric said but significant paul said it says you expect the worst of me edric arched his neck stared sideways at stilgar with a look of apprehension people always expect the worst of the rich and powerful sire it is said one can always tell an aristocrat he reveals only those of his vices which will make him popular a tremor passed across stilgars face paul looked up at the movement sensing the thoughts and angers whispering in stilgars mind how dared this guildsman talk thus to muaddib youre not joking of course paul said joking sire paul grew aware of dryness in his mouth he felt that there were too many people in this room that the air he breathed had passed through too many lungs the taint of melange from edrics tank felt threatening who might my accomplices be in such a conspiracy paul asked presently do you nominate the qizarate edrics shrug stirred the orange gas around his head he no longer appeared concerned by stilgar although the fremen continued to glare at him are you suggesting that my missionaries of the holy orders all of them are preaching subtle falsehood paul insisted it could be a question of selfinterest and sincerity edric said stilgar put a hand to the crysknife beneath his robe paul shook his head said then you accuse me of insincerity im not sure that accuse is the proper word sire the boldness of this creature paul thought and he said accused or not youre saying my bishops and i are no better than powerhungry brigands powerhungry sire again edric looked at stilgar power tends to isolate those who hold too much of it eventually they lose touch with reality and fall mlord stilgar growled youve had men executed for less men yes paul agreed but this is a guild ambassador he accuses you of an unholy fraud stilgar said his thinking interests me stil paul said contain your anger and remain alert as muaddib commands tell me steersman paul said how could we maintain this hypothetical fraud over such enormous distances of space and time without the means to watch every missionary to examine every nuance in every qizarate priory and temple what is time to you edric asked stilgar frowned in obvious puzzlement and he thought muaddib has often said he sees past the veils of time what is the guildsman really saying wouldnt the structure of such a fraud begin to show holes paul asked significant disagreements schisms doubts confessions of guilt surely fraud could not suppress all these what religion and selfinterest can not hide governments can edric said are you testing the limits of my tolerance paul asked do my arguments lack all merit edric countered does he want us to kill him paul wondered is edric offering himself as a sacrifice i prefer the cynical view paul said testing you obviously are trained in all the lying tricks of statecraft the double meanings and the power words language is nothing more than a weapon to you and thus you test my armor the cynical view edric said a smile stretching his mouth and rulers are notoriously cynical where religions are concerned religion too is a weapon what manner of weapon is religion when it becomes the government paul felt himself go inwardly still a profound caution gripping him to whom was edric speaking damnable clever words heavy with manipulation leverages that undertone of comfortable humor the unspoken air of shared secrets his manner said he and paul were two sophisticates men of a wider universe who understood things not granted common folk with a feeling of shock paul realized that he had not been the main target for all this rhetoric this affliction visited upon the court had been speaking for the benefit of others speaking to stilgar to the household guards perhaps even to the hulking aide religious mana was thrust upon me paul said i did not seek it and he thought there let this manfish think himself victorious in our battle of words then why have you not disavowed it sire edric asked because of my sister alia paul said watching edric carefully she is a goddess let me urge caution where alia is concerned lest she strike you dead with her glance a gloating smile began forming on edrics mouth was replaced by a look of shock i am deadly serious paul said watching the shock spread seeing stilgar nod in a bleak voice edric said you have mauled my confidence in you sire and no doubt that was your intent do not be certain you know my intent paul said and he signaled stilgar that the audience was at an end to stilgars questioning gesture asking if edric were to be assassinated paul gave a negative handsign amplified it with an imperative lest stilgar take matters into his own hands scytale edrics aide moved to the rear corner of the tank nudged it toward the door when he came opposite paul he stopped turned that laughing gaze on paul said if my lord permits yes what is it paul asked noting how stilgar moved close in answer to the implied menace from this man some say scytale said that people cling to imperial leadership because space is infinite they feel lonely without a unifying symbol for a lonely people the emperor is a definite place they can turn toward him and say see there he is he makes us one perhaps religion serves the same purpose mlord scytale nodded pleasantly gave edrics tank another nudge they moved out of the salon edric supine in his tank eyes closed the steersman appeared spent all his nervous energies exhausted paul stared after the shambling figure of scytale wondering at the mans words a peculiar fellow that scytale he thought while he was speaking he had radiated a feeling of many people as though his entire genetic inheritance lay exposed on his skin that was odd stilgar said speaking to no one in particular paul arose from the divan as a guard closed the door behind edric and the escort odd stilgar repeated a vein throbbed at his temple paul dimmed the salons lights moved to a window which opened onto an angled cliff of his keep lights glittered far below pigmy movement a work gang moved down there bringing giant plasmeld blocks to repair a facade of alias temple which had been damaged by a freak twisting of a sandblast wind that was a foolish thing usul inviting that creature into these chambers stilgar said usul paul thought my sietch name stilgar reminds me that he ruled over me once that he saved me from the desert why did you do it stilgar asked speaking from close behind paul data paul said i need more data is it not dangerous to try meeting this threat only as a mentat that was perceptive paul thought mentat computation remained finite you couldnt say something boundless within the boundaries of any language mentat abilities had their uses though he said as much now daring stilgar to refute his argument theres always something outside stilgar said some things best kept outside or inside paul said and he accepted for a moment his own oracularmentat summation outside yes and inside here lay the true horror how could he protect himself from himself they certainly were setting him up to destroy himself but this was a position hemmed in by even more terrifying possibilities his reverie was broken by the sound of rapid footsteps the figure of korba the qizara surged through the doorway backlighted by the brilliant illumination in the hallways he entered as though hurled by an unseen force and came to an almost immediate halt when he encountered the salons gloom his hands appeared to be full of shigawire reels they glittered in the light from the hall strange little round jewels that were extinguished as a guardsmans hand came into view closed the door is that you mlord korba asked peering into the shadows what is it stilgar asked stilgar were both here what is it im disturbed by this reception for the guildsman disturbed paul asked the people say mlord that you honor our enemies is that all paul said are those the reels i asked you to bring earlier he indicated the shigawire orbs in korbas hands reels oh yes mlord these are the histories will you view them here ive viewed them i want them for stilgar here for me stilgar asked he felt resentment grow at what he interpreted as caprice on pauls part histories stilgar had sought out paul earlier to discuss the logistics computations for the zabulon conquest the guild ambassadors presence had intervened and now korba with histories how much history do you know paul mused aloud studying the shadowy figure beside him mlord i can name every world our people touched in their migrations i know the reaches of imperial the golden age of earth have you ever studied that earth golden age stilgar was irritated and puzzled why would paul wish to discuss myths from the dawn of time stilgars mind still felt crammed with zabulon data computations from the staff mentats two hundred and five attack frigates with thirty legions support battalions pacification cadres qizarate missionaries the food requirements he had the figures right here in his mind and melange weaponry uniforms medals urns for the ashes of the dead the number of specialists men to produce raw materials of propaganda clerks accountants spies and spies upon the spies i brought the pulsesynchronizer attachment also mlord korba ventured he obviously sensed the tensions building between paul and stilgar and was disturbed by them stilgar shook his head from side to side pulsesynchronizer why would paul wish him to use a mnemonic fluttersystem on a shigawire projector why scan for specific data in histories this was mentat work as usual stilgar found he couldnt escape a deep suspicion at the thought of using a projector and attachments the thing always immersed him in disturbing sensations an overwhelming shower of data which his mind sorted out later surprising him with information he had not known he possessed sire i came with the zabulon computations stilgar said dehydrate the zabulon computations paul snapped using the obscene fremen term which meant that here was moisture no man could demean himself by touching mlord stilgar paul said you urgently need a sense of balance which can come only from an understanding of longterm effects what little information we have about the old times the pittance of data which the butlerians left us korba has brought it for you start with the genghis khan ghengis khan was he of the sardaukar mlord oh long before that he killed perhaps four million he mustve had formidable weaponry to kill that many sire lasbeams perhaps or he didnt kill them himself stil he killed the way i kill by sending out his legions theres another emperor i want you to note in passing a hitler he killed more than six million pretty good for those days killed by his legions stilgar asked yes not very impressive statistics mlord very good stil paul glanced at the reels in korbas hands korba stood with them as though he wished he could drop them and flee statistics at a conservative estimate ive killed sixtyone billion sterilized ninety planets completely demoralized five hundred others ive wiped out the followers of forty religions which had existed since unbelievers korba protested unbelievers all no paul said believers my liege makes a joke korba said voice trembling the jihad has brought ten thousand worlds into the shining light of into the darkness paul said well be a hundred generations recovering from muaddibs jihad i find it hard to imagine that anyone will ever surpass this a barking laugh erupted from his throat what amuses muaddib stilgar asked i am not amused i merely had a sudden vision of the emperor hitler saying something similar no doubt he did no other ruler ever had your powers korba argued who would dare challenge you your legions control the known universe and all the the legions control paul said i wonder if they know this you control your legions sire stilgar interrupted and it was obvious from the tone of his voice that he suddenly felt his own position in that chain of command his own hand guiding all that power having set stilgars thoughts in motion along the track he wanted paul turned his full attention to korba said put the reels here on the divan as korba obeyed paul said how goes the reception korba does my sister have everything well in hand yes mlord korbas tone was wary and chani watches from the spy hole she suspects there may be sardaukar in the guild entourage no doubt shes correct paul said the jackals gather bannerjee stilgar said naming the chief of pauls security detail was worried earlier that some of them might try to penetrate the private areas of the keep have they not yet but there was some confusion in the formal gardens korba said what sort of confusion stilgar demanded paul nodded strangers coming and going korba said trampling the plants whispered conversations i heard reports of some disturbing remarks such as paul asked is this the way our taxes are spent im told the ambassador himself asked that question i dont find that surprising paul said were there many strangers in the gardens dozens mlord bannerjee stationed picked troopers at the vulnerable doors mlord stilgar said he turned as he spoke allowing the salons single remaining light to illuminate half his face the peculiar lighting the face all touched a node of memory in pauls mind something from the desert paul didnt bother bringing it to full recall his attention being focused on how stilgar had pulled back mentally the fremen had a tightskinned forehead which mirrored almost every thought flickering across his mind he was suspicious now profoundly suspicious of his emperors odd behavior i dont like the intrusion into the gardens paul said courtesy to guests is one thing and the formal necessities of greeting an envoy but this ill see to removing them korba said immediately wait paul ordered as korba started to turn in the abrupt stillness of the moment stilgar edged himself into a position where he could study pauls face it was deftly done paul admired the way of it an achievement devoid of any forwardness it was a fremen thing slyness touched by respect for anothers privacy a movement of necessity what time is it paul asked almost midnight sire korba said korba i think you may be my finest creation paul said sire there was injury in korbas voice do you feel awe of me paul asked you are paulmuaddib who was usul in our sietch korba said you know my devotion to have you ever felt like an apostle paul asked korba obviously misunderstood the words but correctly interpreted the tone my emperor knows i have a clean conscience shaihulud save us paul murmured the questioning silence of the moment was broken by the sound of someone whistling as he walked down the outer hall the whistling was stilled by a guardsmans barked command as it came opposite the door korba i think you may survive all this paul said and he read the growing light of understanding on stilgars face the strangers in the gardens sire stilgar asked ahh yes paul said have bannerjee put them out stil korba will assist me sire korba betrayed deep disquiet some of my friends have forgotten they once were fremen paul said speaking to korba but designing his words for stilgar you will mark down the ones chani identifies as sardaukar and you will have them killed do it yourself i want it done quietly and without undue disturbance we must keep in mind that theres more to religion and government than approving treaties and sermons i obey the orders of muaddib korba whispered the zabulon computations stilgar asked tomorrow paul said and when the strangers are removed from the gardens announce that the reception is ended the partys over stil i understand mlord im sure you do paul said here lies a toppled god his fall was not a small one we did but build his pedestal a narrow and a tall one tleilaxu epigram alia crouched resting elbows on knees chin on fists stared at the body on the dune a few bones and some tattered flesh that once had been a young woman the hands the head most of the upper torso were gone eaten by the coriolis wind the sand all around bore the tracks of her brothers medics and questors they were gone now all excepting the mortuary attendants who stood to one side with hayt the ghola waiting for her to finish her mysterious perusal of what had been written here a wheatcolored sky enfolded the scene in the glaucous light common to midafternoon for these latitudes the body had been discovered several hours earlier by a lowflying courier whose instruments had detected a faint water trace where none should be his call had brought the experts and they had learned what that this had been a woman of about twenty years fremen addicted to semuta and she had died here in the crucible of the desert from the effects of a subtle poison of tleilaxu origin to die in the desert was a common enough occurrence but a fremen addicted to semuta this was such a rarity that paul had sent her to examine the scene in the ways their mother had taught them alia felt that she had accomplished nothing here except to cast her own aura of mystery about a scene that was already mysterious enough she heard the gholas feet stir the sand looked at him his attention rested momentarily upon the escort thopters circling overhead like a flock of ravens beware of the guild bearing gifts alia thought the mortuary thopter and her own craft stood on the sand near a rock outcropping behind the ghola focusing on the grounded thopters filled alia with a craving to be airborne and away from here but paul had thought she might see something here which others would miss she squirmed in her stillsuit it felt raspingly unfamiliar after all the suitless months of city life she studied the ghola wondering if he might know something important about this peculiar death a lock of his blackgoat hair she saw had escaped his stillsuit hood she sensed her hand longing to tuck that hair back into place as though lured by this thought his gleaming gray metal eyes turned toward her the eyes set her trembling and she tore her gaze away from him a fremen woman had died here from a poison called the throat of hell a fremen addicted to semuta she shared pauls disquiet at this conjunction the mortuary attendants waited patiently this corpse contained not enough water for them to salvage they felt no need to hurry and theyd believe that alia through some glyptic art was reading a strange truth in these remains no strange truth came to her there was only a distant feeling of anger deep within her at the obvious thoughts in the attendants minds it was a product of the damned religious mystery she and her brother could not be people they had to be something more the bene gesserit had seen to that by manipulating atreides ancestry their mother had contributed to it by thrusting them onto the path of witchery and paul perpetuated the difference the reverend mothers encapsulated in alias memories stirred restlessly provoking adab flashes of thought peace little one you are what you are there are compensations compensations she summoned the ghola with a gesture he stopped beside her attentive patient what do you see in this she asked we may never learn who it was died here he said the head the teeth are gone the hands unlikely such a one had a genetic record somewhere to which her cells could be matched tleilaxu poison she said what do you make of that many people buy such poisons true enough and this flesh is too far gone to be regrown as was done with your body even if you could trust the tleilaxu to do it he said she nodded stood you will fly me back to the city now when they were airborne and pointed north she said you fly exactly as duncan idaho did he cast a speculative glance at her others have told me this what are you thinking now she asked many things stop dodging my question damn you which question she glared at him he saw the glare shrugged how like duncan idaho that gesture she thought accusingly her voice thick and with a catch in it she said i merely wanted your reactions voiced to play my own thoughts against them that young womans death bothers me i was not thinking about that what were you thinking about about the strange emotions i feel when people speak of the one i may have been may have been the tleilaxu are very clever not that clever you were duncan idaho very likely its the prime computation so you get emotional to a degree i feel eagerness im uneasy theres a tendency to tremble and i must devote effort to controlling it i get flashes of imagery what imagery its too rapid to recognize flashes spasms almost memories arent you curious about such memories of course curiosity urges me forward but i move against a heavy reluctance i think what if im not the one they believe me to be i dont like that thought and this is all you were thinking you know better than that alia how dare he use my given name she felt anger rise and go down beneath the memory of the way hed spoken softly throbbing undertones casual male confidence a muscle twitched along her jaw she clenched her teeth isnt that el kuds down there he asked dipping a wing briefly causing a sudden flurry in their escort she looked down at their shadows rippling across the promontory above harg pass at the cliff and the rock pyramid containing the skull of her father el kuds the holy place thats the holy place she said i must visit that place one day he said nearness to your fathers remains may bring memories i can capture she saw suddenly how strong must be this need to know who hed been it was a central compulsion with him she looked back at the rocks the cliff with its base sloping into a dry beach and a sea of sand cinnamon rock lifting from the dunes like a ship breasting waves circle back she said the escort theyll follow swing under them he obeyed do you truly serve my brother she asked when he was on the new course the escort following i serve the atreides he said his tone formal and she saw his right hand lift fall almost the old salute of caladan a pensive look came over his face she watched him peer down at the rock pyramid what bothers you she asked his lips moved a voice emerged brittle tight he was he was a tear slid down his cheek alia found herself stilled by fremen awe he gave water to the dead compulsively she touched a finger to his cheek felt the tear duncan she whispered he appeared locked to the thopters controls gaze fastened to the tomb below she raised her voice duncan he swallowed shook his head looked at her the metal eyes glistening i felt an arm on my shoulders he whispered i felt it an arm his throat worked it was a friend it was my friend who i dont know i think it was i dont know the call light began flashing in front of alia their escort captain wanting to know why they returned to the desert she took the microphone explained that they had paid a brief homage to her fathers tomb the captain reminded her that it was late we will go to arrakeen now she said replacing the microphone hayt took a deep breath banked their thopter around to the north it was my fathers arm you felt wasnt it she asked perhaps his voice was that of the mentat computing probabilities and she saw he had regained his composure are you aware of how i know my father she asked i have some idea let me make it clear she said briefly she explained how she had awakened to reverend mother awareness before birth a terrified fetus with the knowledge of countless lives embedded in her nerve cells and all this after the death of her father i know my father as my mother knew him she said in every last detail of every experience she shared with him in a way i am my mother i have all her memories up to the moment when she drank the water of life and entered the trance of transmigration your brother explained something of this he did why i asked why a mentat requires data oh she looked down at the flat expanse of the shield wall tortured rock pits and crevices he saw the direction of her gaze said a very exposed place that down there but an easy place to hide she said she looked at him it reminds me of a human mind with all its concealments ahhh he said ahhh what does that mean ahhh she was suddenly angry with him and the reason for it escaped her youd like to know what my mind conceals he said it was a statement not a question how do you know i havent exposed you for what you are by my powers of prescience she demanded have you he seemed genuinely curious no sibyls have limits he said he appeared to be amused and this reduced alias anger amused have you no respect for my powers she asked the question sounded weakly argumentative even to her own ears i respect your omens and portents perhaps more than you think he said i was in the audience for your morning ritual and what does that signify youve great ability with symbols he said keeping his attention on the thopters controls thats a bene gesserit thing id say but as with many witches youve become careless of your powers she felt a spasm of fear blared how dare you i dare much more than my makers anticipated he said because of that rare fact i remain with your brother alia studied the steel balls which were his eyes no human expression there the stillsuit hood concealed the line of his jaw his mouth remained firm though great strength in it and determination his words had carried a reassuring intensity dare much more that was a thing duncan idaho might have said had the tleilaxu fashioned their ghola better than they knew or was this mere sham part of his conditioning explain yourself ghola she commanded know thyself is that thy commandment he asked again she felt that he was amused dont bandy words with me you you thing she said she put a hand to the crysknife in its throat sheath why were you given to my brother your brother tells me that you watched the presentation he said youve heard me answer that question for him answer it again for me i am intended to destroy him is that the mentat speaking you know the answer to that without asking he chided and you know as well that such a gift wasnt necessary your brother already was destroying himself quite adequately she weighed these words her hand remaining on the haft of her knife a tricky answer but there was sincerity in the voice then why such a gift she probed it may have amused the tleilaxu and it is true that the guild asked for me as a gift why same answer how am i careless of my powers how are you employing them he countered his question slashed through to her own misgivings she took her hand away from the knife asked why do you say my brother was destroying himself oh come now child where are these vaunted powers have you no ability to reason controlling anger she said reason for me mentat very well he glanced around at their escort returned his attention to their course the plain of arrakeen was beginning to show beyond the northern rim of the shield wall the pattern of the pan and graben villages remained indistinct beneath a dust pall but the distant gleam of arrakeen could be discerned symptoms he said your brother keeps an official panegyrist who who was a gift of the fremen naibs an odd gift from friends he said why would they surround him with flattery and servility have you really listened to this panegyrist the people are illuminated by muaddib the umma regent our emperor came out of darkness to shine resplendently upon all men he is our sire he is precious water from an endless fountain he spills joy for all the universe to drink pah speaking softly alia said if i but repeated your words for our fremen escort theyd hack you into bird feed then tell them my brother rules by the natural law of heaven you dont believe that so why say it how do you know what i believe she experienced trembling that no bene gesserit powers could control this ghola was having an effect she hadnt anticipated you commanded me to reason as a mentat he reminded her no mentat knows what i believe she took two deep shuddering breaths how dare you judge us judge you i dont judge youve no idea how we were taught both of you were taught to govern he said you were conditioned to an overweening thirst for power you were imbued with a shrewd grasp of politics and a deep understanding for the uses of war and ritual natural law what natural law that myth haunts human history haunts its a ghost its insubstantial unreal is your jihad a natural law mentat jabber she sneered im a servant of the atreides and i speak with candor he said servant weve no servants only disciples and i am a disciple of awareness he said understand that child and you dont call me child she snapped she slipped her crysknife half out of its sheath i stand corrected he glanced at her smiled returned his attention to piloting the thopter the cliffsided structure of the atreides keep could be made out now dominating the northern suburbs of arrakeen you are something ancient in flesh that is little more than a child he said and the flesh is disturbed by its new womanhood i dont know why i listen to you she growled but she let the crysknife fall back into its sheath wiped her palm on her robe the palm wet with perspiration disturbed her sense of fremen frugality such a waste of the bodys moisture you listen because you know im devoted to your brother he said my actions are clear and easily understood nothing about you is clear and easily understood youre the most complex creature ive ever seen how do i know what the tleilaxu built into you by mistake or intent he said they gave me freedom to mold myself you retreat into zensunni parables she accused the wise man molds himself the fool lives only to die her voice was heavy with mimicry disciple of awareness men can not separate means and enlightenment he said you speak riddles i speak to the opening mind im going to repeat all this to paul hes heard most of it already she found herself overwhelmed by curiosity how is it youre still alive and free what did he say he laughed and he said people dont want a bookkeeper for an emperor they want a master someone wholl protect them from change but he agreed that destruction of his empire arises from himself why would he say such things because i convinced him i understand his problem and will help him what could you possibly have said to do that he remained silent banking the thopter into the downwind leg for a landing at the guard complex on the roof of the keep i demand you tell me what you said im not sure you could take it ill be the judge of that i command you to speak at once permit me to land us first he said and not waiting for her permission he turned onto the base leg brought the wings into optimum lift settled gently onto the bright orange pad atop the roof now alia said speak i told him that to endure oneself may be the hardest task in the universe she shook her head thats thats a bitter pill he said watching the guards run toward them across the roof taking up their escort positions bitter nonsense the greatest palatinate earl and the lowliest stipendiary serf share the same problem you can not hire a mentat or any other intellect to solve it for you theres no writ of inquest or calling of witnesses to provide answers no servant or disciple can dress the wound you dress it yourself or continue bleeding for all to see she whirled away from him realizing in the instant of action what this betrayed about her own feelings without wile of voice or witchwrought trickery he had reached into her psyche once more how did he do this what have you told him to do she whispered i told him to judge to impose order alia stared out at the guard marking how patiently they waited how orderly to dispense justice she murmured not that he snapped i suggested that he judge no more guided by one principle perhaps and that to keep his friends and destroy his enemies to judge unjustly then what is justice two forces collide each may have the right in his own sphere and heres where an emperor commands orderly solutions those collisions he can not prevent he solves how in the simplest way he decides keeping his friends and destroying his enemies isnt that stability people want order this kind or some other they sit in the prison of their hungers and see that war has become the sport of the rich thats a dangerous form of sophistication its disorderly i will suggest to my brother that you are much too dangerous and must be destroyed she said turning to face him a solution ive already suggested he said and thats why you are dangerous she said measuring out her words youve mastered your passions that is not why im dangerous before she could move he leaned across gripped her chin in one hand planted his lips on hers it was a gentle kiss brief he pulled away and she stared at him with a shock leavened by glimpses of spasmodic grins on the faces of her guardsmen still standing at orderly attention outside alia put a finger to her lips thered been such a sense of familiarity about that kiss his lips had been flesh of a future shed seen in some prescient byway breast heaving she said i should have you flayed because im dangerous because you presume too much i presume nothing i take nothing which is not first offered to me be glad i did not take all that was offered he opened his door slid out come along weve dallied too long on a fools errand he strode toward the entrance dome beyond the pad alia leaped out ran to match his stride ill tell him everything youve said and everything you did she said good he held the door for her he will order you executed she said slipping into the dome why because i took the kiss i wanted he followed her his movement forcing her back the door slid closed behind him the kiss you wanted outrage filled her all right alia the kiss you wanted then he started to move around her toward the drop field as though his movement had propelled her into heightened awareness she realized his candor the utter truthfulness of him the kiss i wanted she told herself true your truthfulness thats whats dangerous she said following him you return to the ways of wisdom he said not breaking his stride a mentat could notve stated the matter more directly now what is it you saw in the desert she grabbed his arm forcing him to a halt hed done it again shocked her mind into sharpened awareness i cant explain it she said but i keep thinking of the face dancers why is that that is why your brother sent you to the desert he said nodding tell him of this persistent thought but why she shook her head why face dancers theres a young woman dead out there he said perhaps no young woman is reported missing among the fremen i think what a joy it is to be alive and i wonder if ill ever leap inward to the root of this flesh and know myself as once i was the root is there whether any act of mine can find it that remains tangled in the future but all things a man can do are mine any act of mine may do it the ghola speaks alias commentary as he lay immersed in the screaming odor of the spice staring inward through the oracular trance paul saw the moon become an elongated sphere it rolled and twisted hissing the terrible hissing of a star being quenched in an infinite sea down down down like a ball thrown by a child it was gone this moon had not set realization engulfed him it was gone no moon the earth quaked like an animal shaking its skin terror swept over him paul jerked upright on his pallet eyes wide open staring part of him looked outward part inward outwardly he saw the plasmeld grillwork which vented his private room and he knew he lay beside a stonelike abyss of his keep inwardly he continued to see the moon fall out out his grillwork of plasmeld looked onto the blazing light of noon across arrakeen inward there lay blackest night a shower of sweet odors from a garden roof nibbled at his senses but no floral perfume could roll back that fallen moon paul swung his feet to the cold surface of the floor peered through the grillwork he could see directly across to the gentle arc of a footbridge constructed of crystalstabilized gold and platinum fire jewels from far cedon decorated the bridge it led to the galleries of the inner city across a pool and fountain filled with waterflowers if he stood paul knew he could look down into petals as clean and red as fresh blood whirling turning there disks of ambient color tossed on an emerald freshet his eyes absorbed the scene without pulling him from spice thralldom that terrible vision of a lost moon the vision suggested a monstrous loss of individual security perhaps hed seen his civilization fall toppled by its own pretensions a moon a moon a falling moon it had taken a massive dose of the spice essence to penetrate the mud thrown up by the tarot all it had shown him was a falling moon and the hateful way hed known from the beginning to buy an end for the jihad to silence the volcano of butchery he must discredit himself disengage disengage disengage floral perfume from the garden roof reminded him of chani he longed for her arms now for the clinging arms of love and forgetfulness but even chani could not exorcise this vision what would chani say if he went to her with the statement that he had a particular death in mind knowing it to be inevitable why not choose an aristocrats death ending life on a secret flourish squandering any years that might have been to die before coming to the end of willpower was that not an aristocrats choice he stood crossed to the lapped opening in the grillwork went out onto a balcony which looked upward to flowers and vines trailing from the garden his mouth held the dryness of a desert march moon moon where is that moon he thought of alias description the young womans body found in the dunes a fremen addicted to semuta everything fitted the hateful pattern you do not take from this universe he thought it grants what it will the remains of a conch shell from the seas of mother earth lay on a low table beside the balcony rail he took its lustrous smoothness into his hands tried to feel backward in time the pearl surface reflected glittering moons of light he tore his gaze from it peered upward past the garden to a sky become a conflagration trails of rainbow dust shining in the silver sun my fremen call themselves children of the moon he thought he put down the conch strode along the balcony did that terrifying moon hold out hope of escape he probed for meaning in the region of mystic communion he felt weak shaken still gripped by the spice at the north end of his plasmeld chasm he came in sight of the lower buildings of the government warren foot traffic thronged the roof walks he felt that the people moved there like a frieze against a background of doors walls tile designs the people were tiles when he blinked he could hold them frozen in his mind a frieze a moon falls and is gone a feeling came over him that the city out there had been translated into an odd symbol for his universe the buildings he could see had been erected on the plain where his fremen had obliterated the sardaukar legions ground once trampled by battles rang now to the rushing clamor of business keeping to the balconys outer edge paul strode around the corner now his vista was a suburb where city structures lost themselves in rocks and the blowing sand of the desert alias temple dominated the foreground green and black hangings along its twothousandmeter sides displayed the moon symbol of muaddib a falling moon paul passed a hand across his forehead and eyes the symbolmetropolis oppressed him he despised his own thoughts such vacillation in another would have aroused his anger he loathed his city rage rooted in boredom flickered and simmered deep within him nurtured by decisions that couldnt be avoided he knew which path his feet must follow hed seen it enough times hadnt he seen it once long ago hed thought of himself as an inventor of government but the invention had fallen into old patterns it was like some hideous contrivance with plastic memory shape it any way you wanted but relax for a moment and it snapped into the ancient forms forces at work beyond his reach in human breasts eluded and defied him paul stared out across the rooftops what treasures of untrammeled life lay beneath those roofs he glimpsed leafgreen places open plantings amidst the chalkred and gold of the roofs green the gift of muaddib and his water orchards and groves lay within his view open plantings to rival those of fabled lebanon muaddib spends water like a madman fremen said paul put his hands over his eyes the moon fell he dropped his hands stared at his metropolis with clarified vision buildings took on an aura of monstrous imperial barbarity they stood enormous and bright beneath the northern sun colossi every extravagance of architecture a demented history could produce lay within his view terraces of mesa proportion squares as large as some cities parks premises bits of cultured wilderness superb artistry abutted inexplicable prodigies of dismal tastelessness details impressed themselves upon him a postern out of most ancient baghdad a dome dreamed in mythical damascus an arch from the low gravity of atar harmonious elevations and queer depths all created an effect of unrivaled magnificence a moon a moon a moon frustration tangled him he felt the pressure of massunconscious that burgeoning sweep of humankind across his universe they rushed upon him with a force like a gigantic tidal bore he sensed the vast migrations at work in human affairs eddies currents gene flows no dams of abstinence no seizures of impotence nor maledictions could stop it muaddibs jihad was less than an eyeblink in this larger movement the bene gesserit swimming in this tide that corporate entity trading in genes was trapped in the torrent as he was visions of a falling moon must be measured against other legends other visions in a universe where even the seemingly eternal stars waned flickered died what mattered a single moon in such a universe far within his fortress citadel so deep within that the sound sometimes lost itself in the flow of city noises a tenstring rebaba tinkled with a song of the jihad a lament for a woman left behind on arrakis her hips are dunes curved by the wind her eyes shine like summer heat two braids of hair hang down her back rich with water rings her hair my hands remember her skin fragrant as amber flowerscented eyelids tremble with memories i am stricken by loves white flame the song sickened him a tune for stupid creatures lost in sentimentality as well sing to the duneimpregnated corpse alia had seen a figure moved in shadows of the balconys grillwork paul whirled the ghola emerged into the suns full glare his metal eyes glittered is it duncan idaho or the man called hayt paul asked the ghola came to a stop two paces from him which would my lord prefer the voice carried a soft ring of caution play the zensunni paul said bitterly meanings within meanings what could a zensunni philosopher say or do to change one jot of the reality unrolling before them at this instant my lord is troubled paul turned away stared at the shield walls distant scarp saw windcarved arches and buttresses terrible mimicry of his city nature playing a joke on him see what i can build he recognized a slash in the distant massif a place where sand spilled from a crevasse and thought there right there we fought sardaukar what troubles my lord the ghola asked a vision paul whispered ahhhhh when the tleilaxu first awakened me i had visions i was restless lonely not really knowing i was lonely not then my visions revealed nothing the tleilaxu told me it was an intrusion of the flesh which men and gholas all suffer a sickness no more paul turned studied the gholas eyes those pitted steely balls without expression what visions did those eyes see duncan duncan paul whispered i am called hayt i saw a moon fall paul said it was gone destroyed i heard a great hissing the earth shook you are drunk on too much time the ghola said i ask for the zensunni and get the mentat paul said very well play my vision through your logic mentat analyze it and reduce it to mere words laid out for burial burial indeed the ghola said you run from death you strain at the next instant refuse to live here and now augury what a crutch for an emperor paul found himself fascinated by a wellremembered mole on the gholas chin trying to live in this future the ghola said do you give substance to such a future do you make it real if i go the way of my visionfuture ill be alive then paul muttered what makes you think i want to live there the ghola shrugged you asked me for a substantial answer where is there substance in a universe composed of events paul asked is there a final answer doesnt each solution produce new questions youve digested so much time you have delusions of immortality the ghola said even your empire my lord must live its time and die dont parade smokeblackened altars before me paul growled ive heard enough sad histories of gods and messiahs why should i need special powers to forecast ruins of my own like all those others the lowliest servant of my kitchens could do this he shook his head the moon fell youve not brought your mind to rest at its beginning the ghola said is that how you destroy me paul demanded prevent me from collecting my thoughts can you collect chaos the ghola asked we zensunni say not collecting that is the ultimate gathering what can you gather without gathering yourself im deviled by a vision and you spew nonsense paul raged what do you know of prescience ive seen the oracle at work the ghola said ive seen those who seek signs and omens for their individual destiny they fear what they seek my falling moon is real paul whispered he took a trembling breath it moves it moves men always fear things which move by themselves the ghola said you fear your own powers things fall into your head from nowhere when they fall out where do they go you comfort me with thorns paul growled an inner illumination came over the gholas face for a moment he became pure duncan idaho i give you what comfort i can he said paul wondered at that momentary spasm had the ghola felt grief which his mind rejected had hayt put down a vision of his own my moon has a name paul whispered he let the vision flow over him then though his whole being shrieked no sound escaped him he was afraid to speak fearful that his voice might betray him the air of this terrifying future was thick with chanis absence flesh that had cried in ecstasy eyes that had burned him with their desire the voice that had charmed him because it played no tricks of subtle control all gone back into the water and the sand slowly paul turned away looked out at the present and the plaza before alias temple three shavenheaded pilgrims entered from the processional avenue they wore grimy yellow robes and hurried with their heads bent against the afternoons wind one walked with a limp dragging his left foot they beat their way against the wind rounded a corner and were gone from his sight just as his moon would go they were gone still his vision lay before him its terrible purpose gave him no choice the flesh surrenders itself he thought eternity takes back its own our bodies stirred these waters briefly danced with a certain intoxication before the love of life and self dealt with a few strange ideas then submitted to the instruments of time what can we say of this i occurred i am not yet i occurred you do not beg the sun for mercy mauddibs travail from the stilgar commentary one moment of incompetence can be fatal the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam reminded herself she hobbled along apparently unconcerned within a ring of fremen guards one of those behind her she knew was a deafmute immune to any wiles of voice no doubt hed been charged to kill her at the slightest provocation why had paul summoned her she wondered was he about to pass sentence she remembered the day long ago when shed tested him the child kwisatz haderach he was a deep one damn his mother for all eternity it was her fault the bene gesserit had lost their hold on this gene line silence surged along the vaulted passages ahead of her entourage she sensed the word being passed paul would hear the silence hed know of her coming before it was announced she didnt delude herself with ideas that her powers exceeded his damn him she begrudged the burdens age had imposed on her the aching joints responses not as quick as once theyd been muscles not as elastic as the whipcords of her youth a long day lay behind her and a long life shed spent this day with the dune tarot in a fruitless search for some clue to her own fate but the cards were sluggish the guards herded her around a corner into another of the seemingly endless vaulted passages triangular metaglass windows on her left gave a view upward to trellised vines and indigo flowers in deep shadows cast by the afternoon sun tiles lay underfoot figures of water creatures from exotic planets water reminders everywhere wealth riches robed figures passed across another hall in front of her cast covert glances at the reverend mother recognition was obvious in their manner and tension she kept her attention on the sharp hairline of the guard immediately in front young flesh pink creases at the uniform collar the immensity of this ighir citadel began to impress her passages passages they passed an open doorway from which emerged the sound of timbur and flute playing soft elder music a glance showed her blueinblue fremen eyes staring from the room she sensed in them the ferment of legendary revolts stirring in wild genes there lay the measure of her personal burden she knew a bene gesserit could not escape awareness of the genes and their possibilities she was touched by a feeling of loss that stubborn fool of an atreides how could he deny the jewels of posterity within his loins a kwisatz haderach born out of this time true but real as real as his abomination of a sister and there lay a dangerous unknown a wild reverend mother spawned without bene gesserit inhibitions holding no loyalty to orderly development of the genes she shared her brothers powers no doubt and more the size of the citadel began to oppress her would the passages never end the place reeked of terrifying physical power no planet no civilization in all human history had ever before seen such manmade immensity a dozen ancient cities could be hidden in its walls they passed oval doors with winking lights she recognized them for ixian handiwork pneumatic transport orifices why was she being marched all this distance then the answer began to shape itself in her mind to oppress her in preparation for this audience with the emperor a small clue but it joined other subtle indications the relative suppression and selection of words by her escort the traces of primitive shyness in their eyes when they called her reverend mother the cold and bland essentially odorless nature of these halls all combined to reveal much that a bene gesserit could interpret paul wanted something from her she concealed a feeling of elation a bargaining lever existed it remained only to find the nature of that lever and test its strength some levers had moved things greater than this citadel a fingers touch had been known to topple civilizations the reverend mother reminded herself then of scytales assessment when a creature has developed into one thing he will choose death rather than change into his opposite the passages through which she was being escorted grew larger by subtle stages tricks of arching graduated amplification of pillared supports displacement of the triangular windows by larger oblong shapes ahead of her finally loomed double doors centered in the far wall of a tall antechamber she sensed that the doors were very large and was forced to suppress a gasp as her trained awareness measured out the true proportions the doorway stood at least eighty meters high half that in width as she approached with her escort the doors swung inward an immense and silent movement of hidden machinery she recognized more ixian handiwork through that towering doorway she marched with her guards into the grand reception hall of the emperor paul atreides muaddib before whom all people are dwarfed now she saw the effect of that popular saying at work as she advanced toward paul on the distant throne the reverend mother found herself more impressed by the architectural subtleties of her surroundings than she was by the immensities the space was large it couldve housed the entire citadel of any ruler in human history the open sweep of the room said much about hidden structural forces balanced with nicety trusses and supporting beams behind these walls and the faraway domed ceiling must surpass anything ever before attempted everything spoke of engineering genius without seeming to do so the hall grew smaller at its far end refusing to dwarf paul on his throne centered on a dais an untrained awareness shocked by surrounding proportions would see him at first as many times larger than his actual size colors played upon the unprotected psyche pauls green throne had been cut from a single hagar emerald it suggested growing things and out of the fremen mythos reflected the mourning color it whispered that here sat he who could make you mourn life and death in one symbol a clever stress of opposites behind the throne draperies cascaded in burnt orange curried gold of dune earth and cinnamon flecks of melange to a trained eye the symbolism was obvious but it contained hammer blows to beat down the uninitiated time played its role here the reverend mother measured the minutes required to approach the imperial presence at her hobbling pace you had time to be cowed any tendency toward resentment would be squeezed out of you by the unbridled power which focused down upon your person you might start the long march toward that throne as a human of dignity but you ended the march as a gnat aides and attendants stood around the emperor in a curiously ordered sequence attentive household guardsmen along the draped back wall that abomination alia two steps below paul and on his left hand stilgar the imperial lackey on the step directly below alia and on the right one step up from the floor of the hall a solitary figure the fleshly revenant of duncan idaho the ghola she marked older fremen among the guardsmen bearded naibs with stillsuit scars on their noses sheathed crysknives at their waists a few maula pistols even some lasguns those most be trusted men she thought to carry lasguns in pauls presence when he obviously wore a shield generator she could see the shimmering of its field around him one burst of a lasgun into that field and the entire citadel would be a hole in the ground her guard stopped ten paces from the foot of the dais parted to open an unobstructed view of the emperor she noted now the absence of chani and irulan wondered at it he held no important audience without them so it was said paul nodded to her silent measuring immediately she decided to take the offensive said so the great paul atreides deigns to see the one he banished paul smiled wryly thinking she knows i want something from her that knowledge had been inevitable she being who she was he recognized her powers the bene gesserit didnt become reverend mothers by chance shall we dispense with fencing he asked would it be this easy she wondered and she said name the thing you want stilgar stirred cast a sharp glance at paul the imperial lackey didnt like her tone stilgar wants me to send you away paul said not kill me she asked i wouldve expected something more direct from a fremen naib stilgar scowled said often i must speak otherwise than i think that is called diplomacy then let us dispense with diplomacy as well she said was it necessary to have me walk all that distance i am an old woman you had to be shown how callous i can be paul said that way youll appreciate magnanimity you dare such gaucheries with a bene gesserit she asked gross actions carry their own messages paul said she hesitated weighed his words so he might yet dispense with her grossly obviously if she if she what say what it is you want from me she muttered alia glanced at her brother nodded toward the draperies behind the throne she knew pauls reasoning in this but disliked it all the same call it wild prophecy she felt pregnant with reluctance to take part in this bargaining you must be careful how you speak to me old woman paul said he called me old woman when he was a stripling the reverend mother thought does he remind me now of my hand in his past the decision i made then must i remake it here she felt the weight of decision a physical thing that set her knees to trembling muscles cried their fatigue it was a long walk paul said and i can see that youre tired we will retire to my private chamber behind the throne you may sit there he gave a handsignal to stilgar arose stilgar and the ghola converged on her helped her up the steps followed paul through a passage concealed by the draperies she realized then why he had greeted her in the hall a dumbshow for the guards and naibs he feared them then and now now he displayed kindly benevolence daring such wiles on a bene gesserit or was it daring she sensed another presence behind glanced back to see alia following the younger womans eyes held a brooding baleful cast the reverend mother shuddered the private chamber at the end of the passage was a twentymeter cube of plasmeld yellow glowglobes for light the deep orange hangings of a desert stilltent around the walls it contained divans soft cushions a faint odor of melange crystal water flagons on a low table it felt cramped tiny after the outer hall paul seated her on a divan stood over her studying the ancient face steely teeth eyes that hid more than they revealed deeply wrinkled skin he indicated a water flagon she shook her head dislodging a wisp of gray hair in a low voice paul said i wish to bargain with you for the life of my beloved stilgar cleared his throat alia fingered the handle of the crysknife sheathed at her neck the ghola remained at the door face impassive metal eyes pointed at the air above the reverend mothers head have you had a vision of my hand in her death the reverend mother asked she kept her attention on the ghola oddly disturbed by him why should she feel threatened by the ghola he was a tool of the conspiracy i know what it is you want from me paul said avoiding her question then he only suspects she thought the reverend mother looked down at the tips of her shoes exposed by a fold of her robe black black shoes and robe showed marks of her confinement stains wrinkles she lifted her chin met an angry glare in pauls eyes elation surged through her but she hid the emotion behind pursed lips slitted eyelids what coin do you offer she asked you may have my seed but not my person paul said irulan banished and inseminated by artificial you dare the reverend mother flared stiffening stilgar took a half step forward disconcertingly the ghola smiled and now alia was studying him well not discuss the things your sisterhood forbids paul said i will listen to no talk of sins abominations or the beliefs left over from past jihads you may have my seed for your plans but no child of irulans will sit on my throne your throne she sneered my throne then who will bear the imperial heir chani she is barren she is with child an involuntary indrawn breath exposed her shock you lie she snapped paul held up a restraining hand as stilgar surged forward weve known for two days that she carries my child but irulan by artificial means only thats my offer the reverend mother closed her eyes to hide his face damnation to cast the genetic dice in such a way loathing boiled in her breast the teaching of the bene gesserit the lessons of the butlerian jihad all proscribed such an act one did not demean the highest aspirations of humankind no machine could function in the way of a human mind no word or deed could imply that men might be bred on the level of animals your decision paul said she shook her head the genes the precious atreides genes only these were important need went deeper than proscription for the sisterhood mating mingled more than sperm and ovum one aimed to capture the psyche the reverend mother understood now the subtle depths of pauls offer he would make the bene gesserit party to an act which would bring down popular wrath were it ever discovered they could not admit such paternity if the emperor denied it this coin might save the atreides genes for the sisterhood but it would never buy a throne she swept her gaze around the room studying each face stilgar passive and waiting now the ghola frozen at some inward place alia watching the ghola and paul wrath beneath a shallow veneer this is your only offer she asked my only offer she glanced at the ghola caught by a brief movement of muscles across his cheeks emotion you ghola she said should such an offer be made having been made should it be accepted function as the mentat for us the metallic eyes turned to paul answer as you will paul said the ghola returned his gleaming attention to the reverend mother shocked her once more by smiling an offer is only as good as the real thing it buys he said the exchange offered here is lifeforlife a high order of business alia brushed a strand of coppery hair from her forehead said and what else is hidden in this bargain the reverend mother refused to look at alia but the words burned in her mind yes far deeper implications lay here the sister was an abomination true but there could be no denying her status as a reverend mother with all the title implied gaius helen mohiam felt herself in this instant to be not one single person but all the others who sat like tiny congeries in her memory they were alert every reverend mother she had absorbed in becoming a priestess of the sisterhood alia would be standing in the same situation here what else the ghola asked one wonders why the witches of the bene gesserit have not used tleilaxu methods gaius helen mohiam and all the reverend mothers within her shuddered yes the tleilaxu did loathsome things if one let down the barriers to artificial insemination was the next step a tleilaxu one controlled mutation paul observing the play of emotion around him felt abruptly that he no longer knew these people he could see only strangers even alia was a stranger alia said if we set the atreides genes adrift in a bene gesserit river who knows what may result gaius helen mohiams head snapped around and she met alias gaze for a flashing instant they were two reverend mothers together communing on a single thought what lay behind any tleilaxu action the ghola was a tleilaxu thing had he put this plan into pauls mind would paul attempt to bargain directly with the bene tleilaxu she broke her gaze from alias feeling her own ambivalence and inadequacies the pitfall of bene gesserit training she reminded herself lay in the powers granted such powers predisposed one to vanity and pride but power deluded those who used it one tended to believe power could overcome any barrier including ones own ignorance only one thing stood paramount here for the bene gesserit she told herself that was the pyramid of generations which had reached an apex in paul atreides and in his abomination of a sister a wrong choice here and the pyramid would have to be rebuilt starting generations back in the parallel lines and with breeding specimens lacking the choicest characteristics controlled mutation she thought did the tleilaxu really practice it how tempting she shook her head the better to rid it of such thoughts you reject my proposal paul asked im thinking she said and again she looked at the sister the optimum cross for this female atreides had been lost killed by paul another possibility remained however one which would cement the desired characteristic into an offspring paul dared offer animal breeding to the bene gesserit how much was he really prepared to pay for his chanis life would he accept a cross with his own sister sparring for time the reverend mother said tell me oh flawless exemplar of all thats holy has irulan anything to say of your proposal irulan will do what you tell her to do paul growled true enough mohiam thought she firmed her jaw offered a new gambit there are two atreides paul sensing something of what lay in the old witchs mind felt blood darken his face careful what you suggest he said youd just use irulan to gain your own ends eh she asked wasnt she trained to be used paul asked and we trained her thats what hes saying mohiam thought well irulans a divided coin was there another way to spend such a coin will you put chanis child on the throne the reverend mother asked on my throne paul said he glanced at wondering suddenly if she knew the divergent possibilities in this exchange alia stood with eyes closed an odd stillnessofperson about her with what inner force did she commune seeing his sister thus paul felt hed been cast adrift alia stood on a shore that was receding from him the reverend mother made her decision said this is too much for one person to decide i must consult with my council on wallach will you permit a message as though she needed my permission paul thought he said agreed then but dont delay too long i will not sit idly by while you debate will you bargain with the bene tleilaxu the ghola asked his voice a sharp intrusion alias eyes popped open and she stared at the ghola as though shed been wakened by a dangerous intruder ive made no such decision paul said what i will do is go into the desert as soon as it can be arranged our child will be born in sietch a wise decision stilgar intoned alia refused to look at stilgar it was a wrong decision she could feel this in every cell paul must know it why had he fixed himself upon such a path have the bene tleilaxu offered their services alia asked she saw mohiam hanging on the answer paul shook his head no he glanced at stilgar stil arrange for the message to be sent to wallach at once mlord paul turned away waited while stilgar summoned guards left with the old witch he sensed alia debating whether to confront him with more questions she turned instead to the ghola mentat she said will the tleilaxu bid for favor with my brother the ghola shrugged paul felt his attention wander the tleilaxu no not in the way alia meant her question revealed though that she had not seen the alternatives here well vision varied from sibyl to sibyl why not a variance from brother to sister wandering wandering he came back from each thought with a start to pick up shards of the nearby conversation must know what the tleilaxu the fullness of data is always healthy doubts where paul turned looked at his sister caught her attention he knew she would see tears on his face and wonder at them let her wonder wondering was a kindness now he glanced at the ghola seeing only duncan idaho despite the metallic eyes sorrow and compassion warred in paul what might those metal eyes record there are many degrees of sight and many degrees of blindness paul thought his mind turned to a paraphrase of the passage from the orange catholic bible what senses do we lack that we can not see another world all around us were those metal eyes another sense than sight alia crossed to her brother sensing his utter sadness she touched a tear on his cheek with a fremen gesture of awe said we must not grieve for those dear to us before their passing before their passing paul whispered tell me little sister what is before ive had a bellyful of the god and priest business you think i dont see my own mythos consult your data once more hayt ive insinuated my rites into the most elementary human acts the people eat in the name of muaddib they make love in my name are born in my name cross the street in my name a roof beam can not be raised in the lowliest hovel of far gangishree without invoking the blessing of muaddib book of diatribes from the hayt chronicle you risk much leaving your post and coming to me here at this time edric said glaring through the walls of his tank at the face dancer how weak and narrow is your thinking scytale said who is it who comes to visit you edric hesitated observing the hulk shape heavy eyelids blunt face it was early in the day and edrics metabolism had not yet cycled from night repose into full melange consumption this is not the shape which walked the streets edric asked one would not look twice at some of the figures i have been today scytale said the chameleon thinks a change of shape will hide him from anything edric thought with rare insight and he wondered if his presence in the conspiracy truly hid them from all oracular powers the emperors sister now edric shook his head stirring the orange gas of his tank said why are you here the gift must be prodded to swifter action scytale said that can not be done a way must be found scytale insisted why things are not to my liking the emperor is trying to split us already he has made his bid to the bene gesserit oh that that you must prod the ghola to you fashioned him tleilaxu edric said you know better than to ask this he paused moved closer to the transparent wall of his tank or did you lie to us about this gift lie you said the weapon was to be aimed and released nothing more once the ghola was given we could not tamper any ghola can be disturbed scytale said you need do nothing more than question him about his original being what will this do it will stir him to actions which will serve our purposes he is a mentat with powers of logic and reason edric objected he may guess what im doing or the sister if her attention is focused upon do you hide us from the sibyl or dont you scytale asked im not afraid of oracles edric said im concerned with logic with real spies with the physical powers of the imperium with the control of the spice with one can contemplate the emperor and his powers comfortably if one remembers that all things are finite scytale said oddly the steersman recoiled in agitation threshing his limbs like some weird newt scytale fought a sense of loathing at the sight the guild navigator wore his usual dark leotard bulging at the belt with various containers yet he gave the impression of nakedness when he moved it was the swimming reaching movements scytale decided and he was struck once more by the delicate linkages of their conspiracy they were not a compatible group that was weakness edrics agitation subsided he stared out at scytale vision colored by the orange gas which sustained him what plot did the face dancer hold in reserve to save himself edric wondered the tleilaxu was not acting in a predictable fashion evil omen something in the navigators voice and actions told scytale that the guildsman feared the sister more than the emperor this was an abrupt thought flashed on the screen of awareness disturbing had they overlooked something important about alia would the ghola be sufficient weapon to destroy both you know what is said of alia scytale asked probing what do you mean again the fishman was agitated never have philosophy and culture had such a patroness scytale said pleasure and beauty unite in what is enduring about beauty and pleasure edric demanded we will destroy both atreides culture they dispense culture the better to rule beauty they promote the beauty which enslaves they create a literate ignorance easiest thing of all they leave nothing to chance chains everything they do forges chains enslaves but slaves always revolt the sister may wed and produce offspring scytale said why do you speak of the sister edric asked the emperor may choose a mate for her scytale said let him choose already it is too late even you can not invent the next moment scytale warned you are not a creator any more than are the atreides he nodded we must not presume too much we arent the ones to flap our tongues about creation edric protested we arent the rabble trying to make a messiah out of muaddib what is this nonsense why are you raising such questions its this planet scytale said it raises questions planets dont speak this one does oh it speaks of creation sand blowing in the night that is creation sand blowing when you awaken the first light shows you the new world all fresh and ready for your tracks untracked sand edric thought creation he felt knotted with sudden anxiety the confinement of his tank the surrounding room everything closed in upon him constricted him tracks in sand you talk like a fremen edric said this is a fremen thought and its instructive scytale agreed they speak of muaddibs jihad as leaving tracks in the universe in the same way that a fremen tracks new sand theyve marked out a trail in mens lives so another night comes scytale said winds blow yes edric said the jihad is finite muaddib has used his jihad and he didnt use the jihad scytale said the jihad used him i think he wouldve stopped it if he could if he could all he had to do was oh be still scytale barked you cant stop a mental epidemic it leaps from person to person across parsecs its overwhelmingly contagious it strikes at the unprotected side in the place where we lodge the fragments of other such plagues who can stop such a thing muaddib hasnt the antidote the thing has roots in chaos can orders reach there have you been infected then edric asked he turned slowly in the orange gas wondering why scytales words carried such a tone of fear had the face dancer broken from the conspiracy there was no way to peer into the future and examine this now the future had become a muddy stream clogged with prophets were all contaminated scytale said and he reminded himself that edrics intelligence had severe limits how could this point be made that the guildsman would understand it but when we destroy him edric said the contag i should leave you in this ignorance scytale said but my duties will not permit it besides its dangerous to all of us edric recoiled steadied himself with a kick of one webbed foot which sent the orange gas whipping around his legs you speak strangely he said this whole thing is explosive scytale said in a calmer voice its ready to shatter when it goes it will send bits of itself out through the centuries dont you see this weve dealt with religions before edric protested if this new it is not just a religion scytale said wondering what the reverend mother would say to this harsh education of their fellow conspirator religious government is something else muaddib has crowded his qizarate in everywhere displaced the old functions of government but he has no permanent civil service no interlocking embassies he has bishoprics islands of authority at the center of each island is a man men learn how to gain and hold personal power men are jealous when theyre divided well absorb them one by one edric said with a complacent smile cut off the head and the body will fall to this body has two heads scytale said the sister who may wed who will certainly wed i dont like your tone scytale and i dont like your ignorance what if she does wed will that shake our plans it will shake the universe but theyre not unique i myself possess powers which youre an infant you toddle where they stride they are not unique you forget guildsman that we once made a kwisatz haderach this is a being filled by the spectacle of time it is a form of existence which can not be threatened without enclosing yourself in the identical threat muaddib knows we would attack his chani we must move faster than we have you must get to the ghola prod him as i have instructed and if i do not we will feel the thunderbolt oh worm of many teeth canst thou deny what has no cure the flesh and breath which lure thee to the ground of all beginnings feed on monsters twisting in a door of fire thou hast no robe in all thy attire to cover intoxications of divinity or hide the burnings of desire wormsong from the dunebook paul had worked up a sweat on the practice floor using crysknife and short sword against the ghola he stood now at a window looking down into the temple plaza tried to imagine the scene with chani at the clinic shed been taken ill at midmorning the sixth week of her pregnancy the medics were the best theyd call when they had news murky afternoon sandclouds darkened the sky over the plaza fremen called such weather dirty air would the medics never call each second struggled past reluctant to enter his universe waiting waiting the bene gesserit sent no word from wallach deliberately delaying of course prescient vision had recorded these moments but he shielded his awareness from the oracle preferring the role here of a timefish swimming not where he willed but where the currents carried him destiny permitted no struggles now the ghola could be heard racking weapons examining the equipment paul sighed put a hand to his own belt deactivated his shield the tingling passage of its field ran down against his skin hed face events when chani came paul told himself time enough then to accept the fact that what hed concealed from her had prolonged her life was it evil he wondered to prefer chani to an heir by what right did he make her choice for her foolish thoughts who could hesitate given the alternatives slave pits torture agonizing sorrow and worse he heard the door open chanis footsteps paul turned murder sat on chanis face the wide fremen belt which gathered the waist of her golden robe the water rings worn as a necklace one hand at her hip never far from the knife the trenchant stare which was her first inspection of any room everything about her stood now only as a background for violence he opened his arms as she came to him gathered her close someone she rasped speaking against his breast has been feeding me a contraceptive for a long time before i began the new diet therell be problems with this birth because of it but there are remedies he asked dangerous remedies i know the source of that poison ill have her blood my sihaya he whispered holding her close to calm a sudden trembling youll bear the heir we want isnt that enough my life burns faster she said pressing against him the birth now controls my life the medics told me it goes at a terrible pace i must eat and eat and take more spice as well eat it drink it ill kill her for this paul kissed her cheek no my sihaya youll kill no one and he thought irulan prolonged your life beloved for you the time of birth is the time of death he felt hidden grief drain his marrow then empty his life into a black flask chani pushed away from him she can not be forgiven who said anything about forgiving they why shouldnt i kill her it was such a flat fremen question that paul felt himself almost overcome by a hysterical desire to laugh he covered it by saying it wouldnt help youve seen that paul felt his belly tighten with visionmemory what ive seen what ive seen he muttered every aspect of surrounding events fitted a present which paralyzed him he felt chained to a future which exposed too often had locked onto him like a greedy succubus tight dryness clogged his throat had he followed the witchcall of his own oracle he wondered until itd spilled him into a merciless present tell me what youve seen chani said i cant why mustnt i kill her because i ask it he watched her accept this she did it the way sand accepted water absorbing and concealing was there obedience beneath that hot angry surface he wondered and he realized then that life in the royal keep had left chani unchanged shed merely stopped here for a time inhabited a way station on a journey with her man nothing of the desert had been taken from her chani stepped away from him then glanced at the ghola who stood waiting near the diamond circle of the practice door youve been crossing blades with him she asked and im better for it her gaze went to the circle on the floor back to the gholas metallic eyes i dont like it she said hes not intended to do me violence paul said youve seen that ive not seen it then how do you know because hes more than ghola hes duncan idaho the bene tleilax made him they made more than they intended she shook her head a corner of her nezhoni scarf rubbed the collar of her robe how can you change the fact that he is ghola hayt paul said are you the tool of my undoing if the substance of here and now is changed the future is changed the ghola said that is no answer chani objected paul raised his voice how will i die hayt light glinted from the artificial eyes it is said mlord that you will die of money and power chani stiffened how dare he speak thus to you the mentat is truthful paul said was duncan idaho a real friend she asked he gave his life for me it is sad chani whispered that a ghola can not be restored to his original being would you convert me the ghola asked directing his gaze to chani what does he mean chani asked to be converted is to be turned around paul said but theres no going back every man carries his own past with him hayt said and every ghola paul asked in a way mlord then what of that past in your secret flesh paul asked chani saw how the question disturbed the ghola his movements quickened hands clenched into fists she glanced at paul wondering why he probed thus was there a way to restore this creature to the man hed been has a ghola ever remembered his real past chani asked many attempts have been made hayt said his gaze fixed on the floor near his feet no ghola has ever been restored to his former being but you long for this to happen paul said the blank surfaces of the gholas eyes came up to center on paul with a pressing intensity yes voice soft paul said if theres a way this flesh hayt said touching left hand to forehead in a curious saluting movement is not the flesh of my original birth it is reborn only the shape is familiar a face dancer might do as well not as well paul said and youre not a face dancer that is true mlord whence comes your shape the genetic imprint of the original cells somewhere paul said theres a plastic something which remembers the shape of duncan idaho its said the ancients probed this region before the butlerian jihad whats the extent of this memory hayt what did it learn from the original the ghola shrugged what if he wasnt idaho chani asked he was can you be certain she asked he is duncan in every aspect i can not imagine a force strong enough to hold that shape thus without any relaxation or any deviation mlord hayt objected because we can not imagine a thing that doesnt exclude it from reality there are things i must do as a ghola that i would not do as a man keeping his attention on chani paul said you see she nodded paul turned away fighting deep sadness he crossed to the balcony windows drew the draperies lights came on in the sudden gloom he pulled the sash of his robe tight listened for sounds behind him nothing he turned chani stood as though entranced her gaze centered on the ghola hayt paul saw had retreated to some inner chamber of his being had gone back to the ghola place chani turned at the sound of pauls return she still felt the thralldom of the instant paul had precipitated for a brief moment the ghola had been an intense vital human being for that moment he had been someone she did not fear indeed someone she liked and admired now she understood pauls purpose in this probing he had wanted her to see the man in the ghola flesh she stared at paul that man was that duncan idaho that was duncan idaho he is still there would he have allowed irulan to go on living chani asked the water didnt sink too deep paul thought and he said if i commanded it i dont understand she said shouldnt you be angry i am angry you dont sound angry you sound sorrowful he closed his eyes yes that too youre my man she said i know this but suddenly i dont understand you abruptly paul felt that he walked down a long cavern his flesh moved one foot and then another but his thoughts went elsewhere i dont understand myself he whispered when he opened his eyes he found that he had moved away from chani she spoke from somewhere behind him beloved ill not ask again what youve seen i only know im to give you the heir we want he nodded then ive known that from the beginning he turned studied her chani seemed very far away she drew herself up placed a hand on her abdomen im hungry the medics tell me i must eat three or four times what i ate before im frightened beloved it goes too fast too fast he agreed this fetus knows the necessity for speed the audacious nature of muaddibs actions may be seen in the fact that he knew from the beginning whither he was bound yet not once did he step aside from that path he put it clearly when he said i tell you that i come now to my time of testing when it will be shown that i am the ultimate servant thus he weaves all into one that both friend and foe may worship him it is for this reason and this reason only that his apostles prayed lord save us from the other paths which muaddib covered with the waters of his life those other paths may be imagined only with the deepest revulsion from the yiameldin book of judgment the messenger was a young woman her face name and family known to chani which was how shed penetrated imperial security chani had done no more than identify her for a security officer named bannerjee who then arranged the meeting with muaddib bannerjee acted out of instinct and the assurance that the young womans father had been a member of the emperors death commandos the dreaded fedaykin in the days before the jihad otherwise he might have ignored her plea that her message was intended only for the ears of muaddib she was of course screened and searched before the meeting in pauls private office even so bannerjee accompanied her hand on knife other hand on her arm it was almost midday when they brought her into the room an odd space mixture of desertfremen and familyaristocrat hiereg hangings lined three walls delicate tapestries adorned with figures out of fremen mythology a view screen covered the fourth wall a silvergray surface behind an oval desk whose top held only one object a fremen sandclock built into an orrery the orrery a suspensor mechanism from lx carried both moons of arrakis in the classic worm trine aligned with the sun paul standing beside the desk glanced at bannerjee the security officer was one of those whod come up through the fremen constabulary winning his place on brains and proven loyalty despite the smuggler ancestry attested by his name he was a solid figure almost fat wisps of black hair fell down over the dark wetappearing skin of his forehead like the crest of an exotic bird his eyes were blueblue and steady in a gaze which could look upon happiness or atrocity without change of expression both chani and stilgar trusted him paul knew that if he told bannerjee to throttle the girl immediately bannerjee would do it sire here is the messenger girl bannerjee said mlady chani said she sent word to you yes paul nodded curtly oddly the girl didnt look at him her attention remained on the orrery she was darkskinned of medium height her figure concealed beneath a robe whose rich wine fabric and simple cut spoke of wealth her blueblack hair was held in a narrow band of material which matched the robe the robe concealed her hands paul suspected that the hands were tightly clasped it would be in character everything about her would be in character including the robe a last piece of finery saved for such a moment paul motioned bannerjee aside he hesitated before obeying now the girl moved one step forward when she moved there was grace still her eyes avoided him paul cleared his throat now the girl lifted her gaze the whiteless eyes widening with just the right shade of awe she had an odd little face with delicate chin a sense of reserve in the way she held her small mouth the eyes appeared abnormally large above slanted cheeks there was a cheerless air about her something which said she seldom smiled the corners of her eyes even held a faint yellow misting which could have been from dust irritation or the tracery of semuta everything was in character you asked to see me paul said the moment of supreme test for this girlshape had come scytale had put on the shape the mannerisms the sex the voice everything his abilities could grasp and assume but this was a female known to muaddib in the sietch days shed been a child then but she and muaddib shared common experiences certain areas of memory must be avoided delicately it was the most exacting part scytale had ever attempted i am otheyms lichna of berk al dib the girls voice came out small but firm giving name father and pedigree paul nodded he saw how chani had been fooled the timbre of voice everything reproduced with exactitude had it not been for his own bene gesserit training in voice and for the web of dao in which oracular vision enfolded him this facedancer disguise might have gulled even him training exposed certain discrepancies the girl was older than her known years too much control tuned the vocal cords set of neck and shoulders missed by a fraction the subtle hauteur of fremen poise but there were niceties too the rich robe had been patched to betray actual status and the features were beautifully exact they spoke a certain sympathy of this face dancer for the role being played rest in my home daughter of otheym paul said in formal fremen greeting you are welcome as water after a dry crossing the faintest of relaxations exposed the confidence this apparent acceptance had conveyed i bring a message she said a mans messenger is as himself paul said scytale breathed softly it went well but now came the crucial task the atreides must be guided onto that special path he must lose his fremen concubine in circumstances where no other shared the blame the failure must belong only to the omnipotent muaddib he had to be led into an ultimate realization of his failure and thence to acceptance of the tleilaxu alternative i am the smoke which banishes sleep in the night scytale said employing a fedaykin code phrase i bear bad tidings paul fought to maintain calmness he felt naked his soul abandoned in a gropingtime concealed from every vision powerful oracles hid this face dancer only the edges of these moments were known to paul he knew only what he could not do he could not slay this face dancer that would precipitate the future which must be avoided at all cost somehow a way must be found to reach into the darkness and change the terrifying pattern give me your message paul said bannerjee moved to place himself where he could watch the girls face she seemed to notice him for the first time and her gaze went to the knife handle beneath the security officers hand the innocent do not believe in evil she said looking squarely at bannerjee ahhh well done paul thought it was what the real lichna wouldve said he felt a momentary pang for the real daughter of otheym dead now a corpse in the sand there was no time for such emotions though he scowled bannerjee kept his attention on the girl i was told to deliver my message in secret she said why bannerjee demanded voice harsh probing because it is my fathers wish this is my friend paul said am i not a fremen then my friend may hear anything i hear scytale composed the girlshape was this a true fremen custom or was it a test the emperor may make his own rules scytale said this is the message my father wishes you to come to him bringing chani why must i bring chani she is your woman and a sayyadina this is a water matter by the rules of our tribes she must attest it that my father speaks according to the fremen way there truly are fremen in the conspiracy paul thought this moment fitted the shape of things to come for sure and he had no alternative but to commit himself to this course of what will your father speak paul asked he will speak of a plot against you a plot among the fremen why doesnt he bring that message in person bannerjee demanded she kept her gaze on paul my father can not come here the plotters suspect him hed not survive the journey could he not divulge the plot to you bannerjee asked how came he to risk his daughter on such a mission the details are locked in a distrans carrier that only muaddib may open she said this much i know why not send the distrans then paul asked it is a human distrans she said ill go then paul said but ill go alone chani must come with you chani is with child when has a fremen woman refused to my enemies fed her a subtle poison paul said it will be a difficult birth her health will not permit her to accompany me now before scytale could still them strange emotions passed over the girlfeatures frustration anger scytale was reminded that every victim must have a way of escape even such a one as muaddib the conspiracy had not failed though this atreides remained in the net he was a creature who had developed firmly into one pattern hed destroy himself before changing into the opposite of that pattern that had been the way with the tleilaxu kwisatz haderach itd be the way with this one and then the ghola let me ask chani to decide this she said i have decided it paul said you will accompany me in chanis stead it requires a sayyadina of the rite are you not chanis friend boxed scytale thought does he suspect no hes being fremencautious and the contraceptive is a fact well there are other ways my father told me i was not to return scytale said that i was to seek asylum with you he said youd not risk me paul nodded it was beautifully in character he couldnt deny this asylum shed plead fremen obedience to a fathers command ill take stilgars wife harah paul said youll tell us the way to your father how do you know you can trust stilgars wife i know it but i dont paul pursed his lips then does your mother live my true mother has gone to shaihulud my second mother still lives and cares for my father why shes of sietch tabr yes i remember her paul said she will serve in chanis place he motioned to bannerjee have attendants take otheyms lichna to suitable quarters bannerjee nodded attendants the key word meant that this messenger must be put under special guard he took her arm she resisted how will you go to my father she pleaded youll describe the way to bannerjee paul said he is my friend no my father has commanded it i can not bannerjee paul said bannerjee paused paul saw the man searching that encyclopedic memory which had helped bring him to his position of trust i know a guide who can take you to otheym bannerjee said then ill go alone paul said sire if you otheym wants it this way paul said barely concealing the irony which consumed him sire its too dangerous bannerjee protested even an emperor must accept some risks paul said the decision is made do as ive commanded reluctantly bannerjee led the face dancer from the room paul turned toward the blank screen behind his desk he felt that he waited for the arrival of a rock on its blind journey from some height should he tell bannerjee about the messengers true nature he wondered no such an incident hadnt been written on the screen of his vision any deviation here carried precipitate violence a moment of fulcrum had to be found a place where he could will himself out of the vision if such a moment existed no matter how exotic human civilization becomes no matter the developments of life and society nor the complexity of the machine human interface there always come interludes of lonely power when the course of humankind the very future of humankind depends upon the relatively simple actions of single individuals from the tlielaxu godbuk as he crossed over on the high footbridge from his keep to the qizarate office building paul added a limp to his walk it was almost sunset and he walked through long shadows that helped conceal him but sharp eyes still might detect something in his carriage that identified him he wore a shield but it was not activated his aides having decided that the shimmer of it might arouse suspicions paul glanced left strings of sandclouds lay across the sunset like slatted shutters the air was hiereg dry through his stillsuit filters he wasnt really alone out here but the web of security hadnt been this loose around him since hed ceased walking the streets alone in the night ornithopters with night scanners drifted far overhead in seemingly random pattern all of them tied to his movements through a transmitter concealed in his clothing picked men walked the streets below others had fanned out through the city after seeing the emperor in his disguise fremen costume down to the stillsuit and temag desert boots the darkened features his cheeks had been distorted with plastene inserts a catchtube ran down along his left jaw as he reached the opposite end of the bridge paul glanced back noted a movement beside the stone lattice that concealed a balcony of his private quarters chani no doubt hunting for sand in the desert shed called this venture how little she understood the bitter choice selecting among agonies he thought made even lesser agonies near unbearable for a blurred emotionally painful moment he relived their parting at the last instant chani had experienced a tauglimpse of his feelings but she had misinterpreted she had thought his emotions were those experienced in the parting of loved ones when one entered the dangerous unknown would that i did not know he thought he had crossed the bridge now and entered the upper passageway through the office building there were fixed glowglobes here and people hurrying on business the qizarate never slept paul found his attention caught by the signs above doorways as though he were seeing them for the first time speed merchants wind stills and retorts prophetic prospects tests of faith religious supply weaponry propagation of the faith a more honest label wouldve been propagation of the bureaucracy he thought a type of religious civil servant had sprung up all through his universe this new man of the qizarate was more often a convert he seldom displaced a freman in the key posts but he was filling all the interstices he used melange as much to show he could afford it as for the geriatric benefits he stood apart from his rulers emperor guild bene gesserit landsraad family or qizarate his gods were routine and records he was served by mentats and prodigious filing systems expediency was the first word in his catechism although he gave proper lipservice to the precepts of the butlerians machines could not be fashioned in the image of a mans mind he said but he betrayed by every action that he preferred machines to men statistics to individuals the faraway general view to the intimate personal touch requiring imagination and initiative as paul emerged onto the ramp at the far side of the building he heard the bells calling the evening rite at alias fane there was an odd feeling of permanence about the bells the temple across the thronged square was new its rituals of recent devising but there was something about this setting in a desert sink at the edge of arrakeen something in the way winddriven sand had begun to weather stones and plastene something in the haphazard way buildings had gone up around the fane everything conspired to produce the impression that this was a very old place full of traditions and mystery he was down into the press of people now committed the only guide his security force could find had insisted it be done this way security hadnt liked pauls ready agreement stilgar had liked it even less and chani had objected most of all the crowd around him even while its members brushed against him glanced his way unseeing and passed on gave him a curious freedom of movement it was the way theyd been conditioned to treat a fremen he knew he carried himself like a man of the inner desert such men were quick to anger as he moved into the quickening flow to the temple steps the crush of people became even greater those all around could not help but press against him now but he found himself the target for ritual apologies your pardon noble sir i can not prevent this discourtesy pardon sir this crush of people is the worst ive ever seen i abase myself holy citizen a lout shoved me paul ignored the words after the first few there was no feeling in them except a kind of ritual fear he found himself instead thinking that he had come a long way from his boyhood days in caladan castle where had he put his foot on the path that led to this journey across a crowded square on a planet so far from caladan had he really put his foot on a path he could not say he had acted at any point in his life for one specific reason the motives and impinging forces had been complex more complex possibly than any other set of goads in human history he had the heady feeling here that he might still avoid the fate he could see so clearly along this path but the crowd pushed him forward and he experienced the dizzy sense that he had lost his way lost personal direction over his life the crowd flowed with him up the steps now into the temple portico voices grew hushed the smell of fear grew stronger acrid sweaty acolytes had already begun the service within the temple their plain chant dominated the other sounds whispers rustle of garments shuffling feet coughs telling the story of the far places visited by the priestess in her holy trance she rides the sandworm of space she guides through all storms into the land of gentle winds though we sleep by the snakes den she guards our dreaming souls shunning the desert heat she hides us in a cool hollow the gleaming of her white teeth guides us in the night by the braids of her hair we are lifted up to heaven sweet fragrance flowerscented surrounds us in her presence balak paul thought thinking in fremen look out she can be filled with angry passion too the temple portico was lined with tall slender glowtubes simulating candle flame they flickered the flickering stirred ancestral memories in paul even while he knew that was the intent this setting was an atavism subtly contrived effective he hated his own hand in it the crowd flowed with him through tall metal doors into the gigantic nave a gloomy place with the flickering lights far away overhead a brilliantly illuminated altar at the far end behind the altar a deceptively simple affair of black wood encrusted with sand patterns from the fremen mythology hidden lights played on the field of a prudoor to create a rainbow borealis the seven rows of chanting acolytes ranked below that spectral curtain took on an eerie quality black robes white faces mouths moving in unison paul studied the pilgrims around him suddenly envious of their intentness their air of listening to truths he could not hear it seemed to him that they gained something here which was denied to him something mysteriously healing he tried to inch his way closer to the altar was stopped by a hand on his arm paul whipped his gaze around met the probing stare of an ancient fremen blueblue eyes beneath overhanging brows recognition in them a name flashed into pauls mind rasir a companion from the sietch days in the press of the crowd paul knew he was completely vulnerable if rasir planned violence the old man pressed close one hand beneath a sandgrimed robe grasping the hilt of a crysknife no doubt paul set himself as best he could to resist attack the old man moved his head toward pauls ear whispered we will go with the others it was the signal to identify his guide paul nodded rasir drew back faced the altar she comes from the east the acolytes chanted the sun stands at her back all things are exposed in the full glare of light her eyes miss no thing neither light nor dark a wailing rebaba jarred across the voices stilled them receded into silence with an electric abruptness the crowd surged forward several meters they were packed into a tight mass of flesh now the air heavy with their breathing and the scent of spice shaihulud writes on clean sand the acolytes shouted paul felt his own breath catch in unison with those around him a feminine chorus began singing faintly from the shadows behind the shimmering prudoor alia alia alia it grew louder and louder fell to a sudden silence again voices beginning vespersoft she stills all storms her eyes kill our enemies and torment the unbelievers from the spires of tuono where dawnlight strikes and clear water runs you see her shadow in the shining summer heat she serves us bread and milk cool fragrant with spices her eyes melt our enemies torment our oppressors and pierce all mysteries she is alia alia alia slowly the voices trailed off paul felt sickened what are we doing he asked himself alia was a child witch but she was growing older and he thought growing older is to grow more wicked the collective mental atmosphere of the temple ate at his psyche he could sense that element of himself which was one with those all around him but the differences formed a deadly contradiction he stood immersed isolated in a personal sin which he could never expiate the immensity of the universe outside the temple flooded his awareness how could one man one ritual hope to knit such immensity into a garment fitted to all men paul shuddered the universe opposed him at every step it eluded his grasp conceived countless disguises to delude him that universe would never agree with any shape he gave it a profound hush spread through the temple alia emerged from the darkness behind the shimmering rainbows she wore a yellow robe trimmed in atreides green yellow for sunlight green for the death which produced life paul experienced the sudden surprising thought that alia had emerged here just for him for him alone he stared across the mob in the temple at his sister she was his sister he knew her ritual and its roots but he had never before stood out here with the pilgrims watched her through their eyes here performing the mystery of this place he saw that she partook of the universe which opposed him acolytes brought her a golden chalice alia raised the chalice with part of his awareness paul knew that the chalice contained the unaltered melange the subtle poison her sacrament of the oracle her gaze on the chalice alia spoke her voice caressed the ears flower sound flowing and musical in the beginning we were empty she said ignorant of all things the chorus sang we did not know the power that abides in every place alia said and in every time the chorus sang here is the power alia said raising the chalice slightly it brings us joy sang the chorus and it brings us distress paul thought it awakens the soul alia said it dispels all doubts the chorus sang in worlds we perish alia said in the power we survive sang the chorus alia put the chalice to her lips drank to his astonishment paul found he was holding his breath like the meanest pilgrim of this mob despite every shred of personal knowledge about the experience alia was undergoing he had been caught in the taoweb he felt himself remembering how that fiery poison coursed into the body memory unfolded the timestopping when awareness became a mote which changed the poison he reexperienced the awakening into timelessness where all things were possible he knew alias present experience yet he saw now that he did not know it mystery blinded the eyes alia trembled sank to her knees paul exhaled with the enraptured pilgrims he nodded part of the veil began to lift from him absorbed in the bliss of a vision he had forgotten that each vision belonged to all those who were still ontheway still to become in the vision one passed through a darkness unable to distinguish reality from insubstantial accident one hungered for absolutes which could never be hungering one lost the present alia swayed with the rapture of spice change paul felt that some transcendental presence spoke to him saying look see there see what youve ignored in that instant he thought he looked through other eyes that he saw an imagery and rhythm in this place which no artist or poet could reproduce it was vital and beautiful a glaring light that exposed all powergluttony even his own alia spoke her amplified voice boomed across the nave luminous night she cried a moan swept like a wave through the crush of pilgrims nothing hides in such a night alia said what rare light is this darkness you can not fix your gaze upon it senses can not record it no words describe it her voice lowered the abyss remains it is pregnant with all the things yet to be ahhhhh what gentle violence paul felt that he waited for some private signal from his sister it could be any action or word something of wizardry and mystical processes an outward streaming that would fit him like an arrow into a cosmic bow this instant lay like quivering mercury in his awareness there will be sadness alia intoned i remind you that all things are but a beginning forever beginning worlds wait to be conquered some within the sound of my voice will attain exalted destinies you will sneer at the past forgetting what i tell you now within all differences there is unity paul suppressed a cry of disappointment as alia lowered her head she had not said the thing he waited to hear his body felt like a dry shell a husk abandoned by some desert insect others must feel something similar he thought he sensed the restlessness about him abruptly a woman in the mob someone far down in the nave to pauls left cried out a wordless noise of anguish alia lifted her head and paul had the giddy sensation that the distance between them collapsed that he stared directly into her glazed eyes only inches away from her who summons me alia asked i do the woman cried i do alia oh alia help me they say my son was killed on muritan is he gone will i never see my son again never you try to walk backward in the sand alia intoned nothing is lost everything returns later but you may not recognize the changed form that returns alia i dont understand the woman wailed you live in the air but you do not see it alia said sharpness in her voice are you a lizard your voice has the fremen accent does a fremen try to bring back the dead what do we need from our dead except their water down in the center of the nave a man in a rich red cloak lifted both hands the sleeves falling to expose whiteclad arms alia he shouted i have had a business proposal should i accept you come here like a beggar alia said you look for the golden bowl but you will find only a dagger i have been asked to kill a man a voice shouted from off to the right a deep voice with sietch tones should i accept accepting would i succeed beginning and end are a single thing alia snapped have i not told you this before you didnt come here to ask that question what is it you can not believe that you must come here and cry out against it shes in a fierce mood tonight a woman near paul muttered have you ever seen her this angry she knows im out here paul thought did she see something in the vision that angered her is she raging at me alia a man directly in front of paul called tell these businessmen and fainthearts how long your brother will rule i permit you to look around that corner by yourself alia snarled you carry your prejudice in your mouth it is because my brother rides the worm of chaos that you have roof and water with a fierce gesture clutching her robe alia whirled away strode through the shimmering ribbons of light was lost in the darkness behind immediately the acolytes took up the closing chant but their rhythm was off obviously theyd been caught by the unexpected ending of the rite an incoherent mumbling arose on all sides of the crowd paul felt the stirring around him restless dissatisfied it was that fool with his stupid question about business a woman near paul muttered the hypocrite what had alia seen what track through the future something had happened here tonight souring the rite of the oracle usually the crowd clamored for alia to answer their pitiful questions they came as beggars to the oracle yes he had heard them thus many times as hed watched hidden in the darkness behind the altar what had been different about this night the old fremen tugged pauls sleeve nodded toward the exit the crowd already was beginning to push in that direction paul allowed himself to be pressed along with them the guides hand upon his sleeve there was the feeling in him then that his body had become the manifestation of some power he could no longer control he had become a nonbeing a stillness which moved itself at the core of the nonbeing there he existed allowing himself to be led through the streets of his city following a track so familiar to his visions that it froze his heart with grief i should know what alia saw bethought i have seen it enough times myself and she didnt cry out against it she saw the alternatives too production growth and income growth must not get out of step in my empire that is the substance of my command there are to be no balanceofpayment difficulties between the different spheres of influence and the reason for this is simply because i command it i want to emphasize my authority in this area i am the supreme energyeater of this domain and will remain so alive or dead my government is the economy order in council the emperor paul muaddib i will leave you here the old man said taking his hand from pauls sleeve it is on the right second door from the far end go with shaihulud muaddib and remember when you were usul pauls guide slipped away into the darkness there would be security men somewhere out there waiting to grab the guide and take the man to a place of questioning paul knew but paul found himself hoping the old fremen would escape there were stars overhead and the distant light of first moon somewhere beyond the shield wall but this place was not the open desert where a man could sight on a star to guide his course the old man had brought him into one of the new suburbs this much paul recognized this street now was thick with sand blown in from encroaching dunes a dim light glowed from a single public suspensor globe far down the street it gave enough illumination to show that this was a deadend street the air around him was thick with the smell of a reclamation still the thing must be poorly capped for its fetid odors to escape loosing a dangerously wasteful amount of moisture into the night air how careless his people had grown paul thought they were millionaires of water forgetful of the days when a man on arrakis could have been killed for just an eighth share of the water in his body why am i hesitating paul wondered it is the second door from the far end i knew that without being told but this thing must be played out with precision so i hesitate the noise of an argument arose suddenly from the corner house on pauls left a woman there berated someone the new wing of their house leaked dust she complained did he think water fell from heaven if dust came in moisture got out some remember paul thought he moved down the street and the quarrel faded away behind water from heaven he thought some fremen had seen that wonder on other worlds he had seen it himself had ordered it for arrakis but the memory of it felt like something that had occurred to another person rain it was called abruptly he recalled a rainstorm on his birthworld clouds thick and gray in the sky of caladan an electric storm presence moist air the big wet drops drumming on skylights it ran in rivulets off the eaves storm drains took the water away to a river which ran muddy and turgid past the family orchards trees there with their barren branches glistening wetly pauls foot caught in a low drift of sand across the street for an instant he felt mud clinging to the shoes of his childhood then he was back in the sand in the dustclotted windmuffled darkness with the future hanging over him taunting he could feel the aridity of life around him like an accusation you did this theyd become a civilization of dryeyed watchers and taletellers people who solved all problems with power and more power and still more power hating every erg of it rough stones came underfoot his vision remembered them the dark rectangle of a doorway appeared on his right black in black otheyms house fates house a place different from the ones around it only in the role time had chosen for it it was a strange place to be marked down in history the door opened to his knock the gap revealed the dull green light of an atrium a dwarf peered out ancient face on a childs body an apparition prescience had never seen youve come then the apparition said the dwarf stepped aside no awe in his manner merely the gloating of a slow smile come in come in paul hesitated thered been no dwarf in the vision but all else remained identical visions could contain such disparities and still hold true to their original plunge into infinity but the difference dared him to hope he glanced back up the street at the creamy pearl glistening of his moon swimming out of jagged shadows the moon haunted him how did it fall come in the dwarf insisted paul entered heard the door thud into its moisture seals behind the dwarf passed him led the way enormous feet slapping the floor opened the delicate lattice gate into the roofed central courtyard gestured they await sire sire paul thought he knows me then before paul could explore this discovery the dwarf slipped away down a side passage hope was a dervish wind whirling dancing in paul he headed across the courtyard it was a dark and gloomy place the smell of sickness and defeat in it he felt daunted by the atmosphere was it defeat to choose a lesser evil he wondered how far down this track had he come light poured from a narrow doorway in the far wall he put down the feeling of watchers and evil smells entered the doorway into a small room it was a barren place by fremen standards with heireg hangings on only two walls opposite the door a man sat on carmine cushions beneath the best hanging a feminine figure hovered in shadows behind another doorway in a barren wall to the left paul felt visiontrapped this was the way itd gone where was the dwarf where was the difference his senses absorbed the room in a single gestalten sweep the place had received painstaking care despite its poor furnishings hooks and rods across the barren walls showed where hangings had been removed pilgrims paid enormous prices for authentic fremen artifacts paul reminded himself rich pilgrims counted desert tapestries as treasures true marks of a hajj paul felt that the barren walls accused him with their fresh gypsum wash the threadbare condition of the two remaining hangings amplified the sense of guilt a narrow shelf occupied the wall on his right it held a row of portraits mostly bearded fremen some in stillsuits with their catchtubes dangling some in imperial uniforms posed against exotic offworld backgrounds the most common scene was a seascape the fremen on cushions cleared his throat forcing paul to look at him it was otheym precisely as the vision had revealed him neck grown scrawny a bird thing which appeared too weak to support the large head the face was a lopsided ruin networks of crisscrossed scars on the left cheek below a drooping wet eye but clear skin on the other side and a straight blueinblue fremen gaze a long kedge of a nose bisected the face otheyms cushion sat in the center of a threadbare rug brown with maroon and gold threads the cushion fabric betrayed splotches of wear and patching but every bit of metal around the seated figure shone from polishing the portrait frames shelf lip and brackets the pedestal of a low table on the right paul nodded to the clear half of otheyms face said good luck to you and your dwelling place it was the greeting of an old friend and sietch mate so i see you once more usul the voice speaking his tribal name whined with an old mans quavering the dull drooping eye on the ruined side of the face moved above the parchment skin and scars gray bristles stubbled that side and the jawline there hung with scabrous peelings otheyms mouth twisted as he spoke the gap exposing silvery metal teeth muaddib always answers the call of a fedaykin paul said the woman in the doorway shadows moved said so stilgar boasts she came forward into the light an older version of the lichna which the face dancer had copied paul recalled then that otheym had married sisters her hair was gray nose grown witchsharp weavers calluses ran along her forefingers and thumbs a fremen woman wouldve displayed such marks proudly in the sietch days but she saw his attention on her hands hid them under a fold of her pale blue robe paul remembered her name then dhuri the shock was he remembered her as a child not as shed been in his vision of these moments it was the whine that edged her voice paul told himself shed whined even as a child you see me here paul said would i be here if stilgar hadnt approved he turned toward otheym i carry your water burden otheym command me this was the straight fremen talk of sietch brothers otheym produced a shaky nod almost too much for that thin neck he lifted a livermarked left hand pointed to the ruin of his face i caught the splitting disease on tarahell usul he wheezed right after the victory when wed all a fit of coughing stopped his voice the tribe will collect his water soon dhuri said she crossed to otheym propped pillows behind him held his shoulder to steady him until the coughing passed she wasnt really very old paul saw but a look of lost hopes ringed her mouth bitterness lay in her eyes ill summon doctors paul said dhuri turned hand on hip weve had medical men as good as any you could summon she sent an involuntary glance to the barren wall on her left and the medical men were costly paul thought he felt edgy constrained by the vision but aware that minor differences had crept in how could he exploit the differences time came out of its skein with subtle changes but the background fabric held oppressive sameness he knew with terrifying certainty that if he tried to break out of the enclosing pattern here itd become a thing of terrible violence the power in this deceptively gentle flow of time oppressed him say what you want of me he growled couldnt it be that otheym needed a friend to stand by him in this time dhuri asked does a fedaykin have to consign his flesh to strangers we shared sietch tabr paul reminded himself she has the right to berate me for apparent callousness what i can do i will do paul said another fit of coughing shook otheym when it had passed he gasped theres treachery usul fremen plot against you his mouth worked then without sound spittle escaped his lips dhuri wiped his mouth with a corner of her robe and paul saw how her face betrayed anger at such waste of moisture frustrated rage threatened to overwhelm paul then that otheym should be spent thus a fedaykin deserved better but no choice remained not for a death commando or his emperor they walked occams razor in this room the slightest misstep multiplied horrors not just for themselves but for all humankind even for those who would destroy them paul squeezed calmness into his mind looked at dhuri the expression of terrible longing with which she gazed at otheym strengthened paul chani must never look at me that way he told himself lichna spoke of a message paul said my dwarf otheym wheezed i bought him on on on a world i forget hes a human distrans a toy discarded by the tleilaxu hes recorded all the names the traitors otheym fell silent trembling you speak of lichna dhuri said when you arrived we knew shed reached you safely if youre thinking of this new burden otheym places upon you lichna is the sum of that burden an even exchange usul take the dwarf and go paul suppressed a shudder closed his eyes lichna the real daughter had perished in the desert a semutawracked body abandoned to the sand and the wind opening his eyes paul said you couldve come to me at any time for otheym stayed away that he might be numbered among those who hate you usul dhuri said the house to the south of us at the end of the street that is a gathering place for your foes its why we took this hovel then summon the dwarf and well leave paul said youve not listened well dhuri said you must take the dwarf to a safe place otheym said an odd strength in his voice he carries the only record of the traitors no one suspects his talent they think i keep him for amusement we can not leave dhuri said only you and the dwarf its known how poor we are weve said were selling the dwarf theyll take you for the buyer its your only chance paul consulted his memory of the vision in it hed left here with the names of the traitors but never seeing how those names were carried the dwarf obviously moved under the protection of another oracle it occurred to paul then that all creatures must carry some kind of destiny stamped out by purposes of varying strengths by the fixation of training and disposition from the moment the jihad had chosen him hed felt himself hemmed in by the forces of a multitude their fixed purposes demanded and controlled his course any delusions of free will he harbored now must be merely the prisoner rattling his cage his curse lay in the fact that he saw the cage he saw it he listened now to the emptiness of this house only the four of them in it dhuri otheym the dwarf and himself he inhaled the fear and tension of his companions sensed the watchers his own force hovering in thopters far overhead and those others next door i was wrong to hope paul thought but thinking of hope brought him a twisted sense of hope and he felt that he might yet seize his moment summon the dwarf he said bijaz dhuri called you call me the dwarf stepped into the room from the courtyard an alert expression of worry on his face you have a new master bijaz dhuri said she stared at paul you may call him usul usul thats the base of the pillar bijaz said translating how can usul be base when im the basest thing living he always speaks thus otheym apologized i dont speak bijaz said i operate a machine called language it creaks and groans but is mine own a tleilaxu toy learned and alert paul thought the bene tleilax never threw away something this valuable he turned studied the dwarf round melange eyes returned his stare what other talents have you bijaz paul asked i know when we should leave bijaz said its a talent few men have theres a time for endings and thats a good beginning let us begin to go usul paul examined his vision memory no dwarf but the little mans words fitted the occasion at the door you called me sire paul said you know me then youve sired sire bijaz said grinning you are much more than the base usul youre the atreides emperor paul muaddib and you are my finger he held up the index finger of his right hand bijaz dhuri snapped you tempt fate i tempt my finger bijaz protested voice squeaking he pointed at usul i point at usul is my finger not usul himself or is it a reflection of something more base he brought the finger close to his eyes examined it with a mocking grin first one side then the other ahhh its merely a finger after all he often rattles on thus dhuri said worry in her voice i think its why he was discarded by the tleilaxu ill not be patronized bijaz said yet i have a new patron how strange the workings of the finger he peered at dhuri and otheym eyes oddly bright a weak glue bound us otheym a few tears and we part the dwarfs big feet rasped on the floor as he whirled completely around stopped facing paul ahhh patron i came the long way around to find you paul nodded youll be kind usul bijaz asked im a person you know persons come in many shapes and sizes this be but one of them im weak of muscle but strong of mouth cheap to feed but costly to fill empty me as you will theres still more in me than men put there weve no time for your stupid riddles dhuri growled you should be gone im riddled with conundrums bijaz said but not all of them stupid to be gone usul is to be a bygone yes let us let bygones be bygones dhuri speaks truth and ive the talent for hearing that too youve truthsense paul asked determined now to wait out the clockwork of his vision anything was better than shattering these moments and producing the new consequences there remained things for otheym to say lest time be diverted into even more horrifying channels ive nowsense bijaz said paul noted that the dwarf had grown more nervous was the little man aware of things about to happen could bijaz be his own oracle did you inquire of lichna otheym asked suddenly peering up at dhuri with his one good eye lichna is safe dhuri said paul lowered his head lest his expression betray the lie safe lichna was ashes in a secret grave thats good then otheym said taking pauls lowered head for a nod of agreement one good thing among the evils usul i dont like the world were making you know that it was better when we were alone in the desert with only the harkonnens for enemy theres but a thin line between many an enemy and many a friend bijaz said where that line stops theres no beginning and no end lets end it my friends he moved to pauls side jittered from one foot to the other whats nowsense paul asked dragging out these moments goading the dwarf now bijaz said trembling now now he tugged at pauls robe let us go now his mouth rattles but theres no harm in him otheym said affection in his voice the one good eye staring at bijaz even a rattle can signal departure bijaz said and so can tears lets be gone while theres time to begin bijaz what do you fear paul asked i fear the spirit seeking me now bijaz muttered perspiration stood out on his forehead his cheeks twitched i fear the one who thinks not and will have no body except mine and that one gone back into itself i fear the things i see and the things i do not see this dwarf does possess the power of prescience paul thought bijaz shared the terrifying oracle did he share the oracles fate as well how potent was the dwarfs power did he have the little prescience of those who dabbled in the dune tarot or was it something greater how much had he seen best you go dhuri said bijaz is right every minute we linger bijaz said prolongs prolongs the present every minute i linger defers my guilt paul thought a worms poisonous breath its teeth dripping dust had washed over him it had happened long ago but he inhaled the memory of it now spice and bitterness he could sense his own worm waiting the urn of the desert these are troubled times he said addressing himself to otheyms judgment of their world fremen know what to do in time of trouble dhuri said otheym contributed a shaky nod paul glanced at dhuri hed not expected gratitude would have been burdened by it more than he could bear but otheyms bitterness and the passionate resentment he saw in dhuris eyes shook his resolve was anything worth this price delay serves no purpose dhuri said do what you must usul otheym wheezed paul sighed the words of the vision had been spoken therell be an accounting he said to complete it turning he strode from the room heard bijaz footslapping behind bygones bygones bijaz muttered as they went let bygones fall where they may this has been a dirty day the convoluted wording of legalisms grew up around the necessity to hide from ourselves the violence we intend toward each other between depriving a man of one hour from his life and depriving him of his life there exists only a difference of degree you have done violence to him consumed his energy elaborate euphemisms may conceal your intent to kill but behind any use of power over another the ultimate assumption remains i feed on your energy addenda to orders in council the emperor paul muaddib first moon stood high over the city as paul his shield activated and shimmering around him emerged from the culdesac a wind off the massif whirled sand and dust down the narrow street causing bijaz to blink and shield his eyes we must hurry the dwarf muttered hurry hurry you sense danger paul asked probing i know danger an abrupt sense of peril very near was followed almost immediately by a figure joining them out of a doorway bijaz crouched and whimpered it was only stilgar moving like a war machine head thrust forward feet striking the street solidly swiftly paul explained the value of the dwarf handed bijaz over to stilgar the pace of the vision moved here with great rapidity stilgar sped away with bijaz security guards enveloped paul orders were given to send men down the street toward the house beyond otheyms the men hurried to obey shadows among shadows more sacrifices paul thought we want live prisoners one of the guard officers hissed the sound was a visionecho in pauls ears it went with solid precision here visionreality tick for tick ornithopters drifted down across the moon the night was full of imperial troopers attacking a soft hiss grew out of the other sounds climbed to a roar while they still heard the sibilance it picked up a terracotta glow that hid the stars engulfed the moon paul knowing that sound and glow from the earliest nightmare glimpses of his vision felt an odd sense of fulfillment it went the way it must stone burner someone screamed stone burner the cry was all around him stone burner stone burner because it was required of him paul threw a protective arm across his face dove for the low lip of a curb it already was too late of course where otheyms house had been there stood now a pillar of fire a blinding jet roaring at the heavens it gave off a dirty brilliance which threw into sharp relief every ballet movement of the fighting and fleeing men the tipping retreat of ornithopters for every member of this frantic throng it was too late the ground grew hot beneath paul he heard the sound of running stop men threw themselves down all around him every one of them aware that there was no point in running the first damage had been done and now they must wait out the extent of the stone burners potency the thingss radiation which no man could outrun already had penetrated their flesh the peculiar result of stoneburner radiation already was at work in them what else this weapon might do now lay in the planning of the men who had used it the men who had defied the great convention to use it gods a stone burner someone whimpered i dont want to be blind who does the harsh voice of a trooper far down the street the tleilaxu will sell many eyes here someone near paul growled now shut up and wait they waited paul remained silent thinking what this weapon implied too much fuel in it and itd cut its way into the planets core dunes molten level lay deep but the more dangerous for that such pressures released and out of control might split a planet scattering lifeless bits and pieces through space i think its dying down a bit someone said its just digging deeper paul cautioned stay put all of you stilgar will be sending help stilgar got away stilgar got away the grounds hot someone complained they dared use atomics a trooper near paul protested the sounds diminishing someone down the street said paul ignored the words concentrated on his fingertips against the street he could feel the rollingrumbling of the thing deep deep my eyes someone cried i cant see someone closer to it than i was paul thought he still could see to the end of the culdesac when he lifted his head although there was a mistiness across the scene a redyellow glow filled the area where otheyms house and its neighbor had been pieces of adjoining buildings made dark patterns as they crumbled into the glowing pit paul climbed to his feet he felt the stone burner die silence beneath him his body was wet with perspiration against the stillsuits slickness too much for the suit to accommodate the air he drew into his lungs carried the heat and sulfur stench of the burner as he looked at the troopers beginning to stand up around him the mist on pauls eyes faded into darkness he summoned up his oracular vision of these moments then turned and strode along the track that time had carved for him fitting himself into the vision so tightly that it could not escape he felt himself grow aware of this place as a multitudinous possession reality welded to prediction moans and groans of his troopers arose all around him as the men realized their blindness hold fast paul shouted help is coming and as the complaints persisted he said this is muaddib i command you to hold fast help comes silence then true to his vision a nearby guardsman said is it truly the emperor which of you can see tell me none of us has eyes paul said they have taken my eyes as well but not my vision i can see you standing there a dirty wall within touching distance on your left now wait bravely stilgar comes with our friends the thwockthwock of many thopters grew louder all around there was the sound of hurrying feet paul watched his friends come matching their sounds to his oracular vision stilgar paul shouted waving an arm over here thanks to shaihulud stilgar cried running up to paul youre not in the sudden silence pauls vision showed him stilgar staring with an expression of agony at the ruined eyes of his friend and emperor oh m lord stilgar groaned usul usul usul what of the stone burner one of the newcomers shouted its ended paul said raising his voice he gestured get up there now and rescue the ones who were closest to it put up barriers lively now he turned back to stilgar do you see mlord stilgar asked wonder in his tone how can you see for answer paul put a finger out to touch stilgars cheek above the stillsuit mouthcap felt tears you need give no moisture to me old friend paul said i am not dead but your eyes theyve blinded my body but not my vision paul said ah stil i live in an apocalyptic dream my steps fit into it so precisely that i fear most of all i will grow bored reliving the thing so exactly usul i dont i dont dont try to understand it accept it i am in the world beyond this world here for me they are the same i need no hand to guide me i see every movement all around me i see every expression of your face i have no eyes yet i see stilgar shook his head sharply sire we must conceal your affliction from we hide it from no man paul said but the law we live by the atreides law now stil the fremen law that the blind should be abandoned in the desert applies only to the blind i am not blind i live in the cycle of being where the war of good and evil has its arena we are at a turning point in the succession of ages and we have our parts to play in a sudden stillness paul heard one of the wounded being led past him it was terrible the man groaned a great fury of fire none of these men shall be taken into the desert paul said you hear me stil i hear you mlord they are to be fitted with new eyes at my expense it will be done mlord paul hearing the awe grow in stilgars voice said i will be at the command thopter take charge here yes mlord paul stepped around stilgar strode down the street his vision told him every movement every irregularity beneath his feet every face he encountered he gave orders as he moved pointing to men of his personal entourage calling out names summoning to himself the ones who represented the intimate apparatus of government he could feel the terror grow behind him the fearful whispers his eyes but he looked right at you called you by name at the command thopter he deactivated his personal shield reached into the machine and took the microphone from the hand of a startled communications officer issued a swift string of orders thrust the microphone back into the officers hand turning paul summoned a weapons specialist one of the eager and brilliant new breed who remembered sietch life only dimly they used a stone burner paul said after the briefest pause the man said so i was told sire you know what that means of course the fuel could only have been atomic paul nodded thinking of how this mans mind must be racing atomics the great convention prohibited such weapons discovery of the perpetrator would bring down the combined retributive assault of the great houses old feuds would be forgotten discarded in the face of this threat and the ancient fears it aroused it can not have been manufactured without leaving some traces paul said you will assemble the proper equipment and search out the place where the stone burner was made at once sire with one last fearful glance the man sped away mlord the communications officer ventured from behind him your eyes paul turned reached into the thopter returned the command set to his personal band call chani he ordered tell her tell her i am alive and will be with her soon now the forces gather paul thought and he noted how strong was the smell of fear in the perspiration all around he has gone from alia the womb of heaven holy holy holy firesand leagues confront our lord he can see without eyes a demon upon him holy holy holy equation he solved for martyrdom the moon falls down songs of muaddib after seven days of radiating fevered activity the keep took on an unnatural quiet on this morning there were people about but they spoke in whispers heads close together and they walked softly some scurried with an oddly furtive gait the sight of a guard detail coming in from the forecourt drew questioning looks and frowns at the noise which the newcomers brought with their tramping about and stacking of weapons the newcomers caught the mood of the interior though and began moving in that furtive way talk of the stone burner still floated around he said the fire had bluegreen in it and a smell out of hell elpa is a fool he says hell commit suicide rather than take tleilaxu eyes i dont like talk of eyes muaddib passed me and called me by name how does he see without eyes people are leaving had you heard theres great fear the naibs say theyll go to sietch makab for a grand council whatve they done with the panegyrist i saw them take him into the chamber where the naibs are meeting imagine korba a prisoner chani had arisen early awakened by a stillness in the keep awakening shed found paul sitting beside her his eyeless sockets aimed at some formless place beyond the far wall of their bedchamber what the stone burner had done with its peculiar affinity for eye tissue all that ruined flesh had been removed injections and unguents had saved the stronger flesh around the sockets but she felt that the radiation had gone deeper ravenous hunger seized her as she sat up she fed on the food kept by the bedside spicebread a heavy cheese paul gestured at the food beloved there was no way to spare you this believe me chani stilled a fit of trembling when he aimed those empty sockets at her shed given up asking him to explain he spoke so oddly i was baptized in sand and it cost me the knack of believing who trades in faiths anymore wholl buy wholl sell what could he mean by such words he refused even to consider tleilaxu eyes although he bought them with a lavish hand for the men whod shared his affliction hunger satisfied chani slipped from bed glanced back at paul noted his tiredness grim lines framed his mouth the dark hair stood up mussed from a sleep that hadnt healed he appeared so saturnine and remote the back and forth of waking and sleeping did nothing to change this she forced herself to turn away whispered my love my love he leaned over pulled her back into the bed kissed her cheeks soon well go back to our desert he whispered only a few things remain to be done here she trembled at the finality in his voice he tightened his arms around her murmured dont fear me my sihaya forget mystery and accept love theres no mystery about love it comes from life cant you feel that yes she put a palm against his chest counting his heartbeats his love cried out to the fremen spirit in her torrential outpouring savage a magnetic power enveloped her i promise you a thing beloved he said a child of ours will rule such an empire that mine will fade in comparison such achievements of living and art and sublime were here now she protested fighting a dry sob and i feel we have so little time we have eternity beloved you may have eternity i have only now but this is eternity he stroked her forehead she pressed against him lips on his neck the pressure agitated the life in her womb she felt it stir paul felt it too he put a hand on her abdomen said ahh little ruler of the universe wait your time this moment is mine she wondered then why he always spoke of the life within her as singular hadnt the medics told him she searched back in her own memory curious that the subject had never arisen between them surely he must know she carried twins she hesitated on the point of raising this question he must know he knew everything he knew all the things that were herself his hands his mouth all of him knew her presently she said yes love this is forever this is real and she closed her eyes tightly lest sight of his dark sockets stretch her soul from paradise to hell no matter the rihani magic in which hed enciphered their lives his flesh remained real his caresses could not be denied when they arose to dress for the day she said if the people only knew your love but his mood had changed you cant build politics on love he said people arent concerned with love its too disordered they prefer despotism too much freedom breeds chaos we cant have that can we and how do you make despotism lovable youre not a despot she protested tying her scarf your laws are just ahh laws he said he crossed to the window pulled back the draperies as though he could look out whats law control law filters chaos and what drips through serenity law our highest ideal and our basest nature dont look too closely at the law do and youll find the rationalized interpretations the legal casuistry the precedents of convenience youll find the serenity which is just another word for death chanis mouth drew into a tight line she couldnt deny his wisdom and sagacity but these moods frightened her he turned upon himself and she sensed internal wars it was as though he took the fremen maxim never to forgive never to forget and whipped his own flesh with it she crossed to his side stared past him at an angle the growing heat of the day had begun pulling the north wind out of these protected latitudes the wind painted a false sky full of ochre plumes and sheets of crystal strange designs in rushing gold and red high and cold the wind broke against the shield wall with fountains of dust paul felt chanis warmth beside him momentarily he lowered a curtain of forgetfulness across his vision he might just be standing here with his eyes closed time refused to stand still for him though he inhaled darkness starless tearless his affliction dissolved substance until all that remained was astonishment at the way sounds condensed his universe everything around him leaned on his lonely sense of hearing falling back only when he touched objects the drapery chanis hand he caught himself listening for chanis breaths where was the insecurity of things that were only probable he asked himself his mind carried such a burden of mutilated memories for every instant of reality there existed countless projections things fated never to be an invisible self within him remembered the false pasts their burden threatening at times to overwhelm the present chani leaned against his arm he felt his body through her touch dead flesh carried by time eddies he reeked of memories that had glimpsed eternity to see eternity was to be exposed to eternitys whims oppressed by endless dimensions the oracles false immortality demanded retribution past and future became simultaneous once more the vision arose from its black pit locked onto him it was his eyes it moved his muscles it guided him into the next moment the next hour the next day until he felt himself to be always there its time we were going chani said the council alia will be there to stand in my place does she know what to do she knows alias day began with a guard squadron swarming into the parade yard below her quarters she stared down at a scene of frantic confusion clamorous and intimidating babble the scene became intelligible only when she recognized the prisoner theyd brought korba the panegyrist she made her morning toilet moving occasionally to the window keeping watch on the progress of impatience down there her gaze kept straying to korba she tried to remember him as the rough and bearded commander of the third wave in the battle of arrakeen it was impossible korba had become an immaculate fop dressed now in a parato silk robe of exquisite cut it lay open to the waist revealing a beautifully laundered ruff and embroidered undercoat set with green gems a purple belt gathered the waist the sleeves poking through the robes armhole slits had been tailored into rivulet ridges of dark green and black velvet a few naibs had come out to observe the treatment accorded a fellow fremen theyd brought on the clamor exciting korba to protest his innocence alia moved her gaze across the fremen faces trying to recapture memories of the original men the present blotted out the past theyd all become hedonists samplers of pleasures most men couldnt even imagine their uneasy glances she saw strayed often to the doorway into the chamber where they would meet they were thinking of muaddibs blindsight a new manifestation of mysterious powers by their law a blind man should be abandoned in the desert his water given up to shaihulud but eyeless muaddib saw them they disliked buildings too and felt vulnerable in space built above the ground give them a proper cave cut from rock then they could relax but not here not with this new muaddib waiting inside as she turned to go down to the meeting she saw the letter where shed left it on a table by the door the latest message from their mother despite the special reverence held for caladan as the place of pauls birth the lady jessica had emphasized her refusal to make her planet a stop on the hajj no doubt my son is an epochal figure of history shed written but i can not see this as an excuse for submitting to a rabble invasion alia touched the letter experienced an odd sensation of mutual contact this paper had been in her mothers hands such an archaic device the letter but personal in a way no recording could achieve written in the atreides battle tongue it represented an almost invulnerable privacy of communication thinking of her mother afflicted alia with the usual inward blurring the spice change that had mixed the psyches of mother and daughter forced her at times to think of paul as a son to whom she had given birth the capsulecomplex of oneness could present her own father as a lover ghost shadows cavorted in her mind people of possibility alia reviewed the letter as she walked down the ramp to the antechamber where her guard amazons waited you produce a deadly paradox jessica had written government can not be religious and selfassertive at the same time religious experience needs a spontaneity which laws inevitably suppress and you can not govern without laws your laws eventually must replace morality replace conscience replace even the religion by which you think to govern sacred ritual must spring from praise and holy yearnings which hammer out a significant morality government on the other hand is a cultural organism particularly attractive to doubts questions and contentions i see the day coming when ceremony must take the place of faith and symbolism replaces morality the smell of spicecoffee greeted alia in the antechamber four guard amazons in green watchrobes came to attention as she entered they fell into step behind her striding firmly in the bravado of their youth eyes alert for trouble they had zealot faces untouched by awe they radiated that special fremen quality of violence they could kill casually with no sense of guilt in this i am different alia thought the atreides name has enough dirt on it without that word preceded her a waiting page darted off as she entered the lower hall running to summon the full guard detail the hall stretched out windowless and gloomy illuminated only by a few subdued glowglobes abruptly the doors to the parade yard opened wide at the far end to admit a glaring shaft of daylight the guard with korba in their midst wavered into view from the outside with the light behind them where is stilgar alia demanded already inside one of her amazons said alia led the way into the chamber it was one of the keeps more pretentious meeting places a high balcony with rows of soft seats occupied one side across from the balcony orange draperies had been pulled back from tall windows bright sunlight poured through from an open space with a garden and a fountain at the near end of the chamber on her right stood a dais with a single massive chair moving to the chair alia glanced back and up saw the gallery filled with naibs household guardsmen packed the open space beneath the gallery stilgar moving among them with a quiet word here a command there he gave no sign that hed seen alia enter korba was brought in seated at a low table with cushions beside it on the chamber floor below the dais despite his finery the panegyrist gave the appearance now of a surly sleepy old man huddled up in his robes as against the outer cold two guardsmen took up positions behind him stilgar approached the dais as alia seated herself where is muaddib he asked my brother has delegated me to preside as reverend mother alia said hearing this the naibs in the gallery began raising their voices in protest silence alia commanded in the abrupt quiet she said is it not fremen law that a reverend mother presides when life and death are at issue as the gravity of her statement penetrated stillness came over the naibs but alia marked angry stares across the rows of faces she named them in her mind for discussion in council hobars rajifiri tasmin saajid umbu legg the names carried pieces of dune in them umbu sietch tasmin sink hobars gap she turned her attention to korba observing her attention korba lifted his chin said i protest my innocence stilgar read the charges alia said stilgar produced a brown spicepaper scroll stepped forward he began reading a solemn flourish in his voice as though to hidden rhythms he gave the words an incisive quality clear and full of probity that you did conspire with traitors to accomplish the destruction of our lord and emperor that you did meet in vile secrecy with diverse enemies of the realm that you korba kept shaking his head with a look of pained anger alia listened broodingly chin planted on her left fist head cocked to that side the other arm extended along the chair arm bits of the formal procedure began dropping out of her awareness screened by her own feelings of disquiet venerable tradition support of the legions and all fremen everywhere violence met with violence according to the law majesty of the imperial person forfeit all rights to it was nonsense she thought nonsense all of it nonsense nonsense nonsense stilgar finished thus the issue is brought to judgment in the immediate silence korba rocked forward hands gripping his knees veined neck stretched as though he were preparing to leap his tongue flicked between his teeth as he spoke not by word or deed have i been traitor to my fremen vows i demand to confront my accuser a simple enough protest alia thought and she saw that it had produced a considerable effect on the naibs they knew korba he was one of them to become a naib hed proved his fremen courage and caution not brilliant korba but reliable not one to lead a jihad perhaps but a good choice as supply officer not a crusader but one who cherished the old fremen virtues the tribe is paramount otheyms bitter words as paul had recited them swept through alias mind she scanned the gallery any of those men might see himself in korbas place some for good reason but an innocent naib was as dangerous as a guilty one here korba felt it too who accuses me he demanded i have a fremen right to confront my accuser perhaps you accuse yourself alia said before he could mask it mystical terror lay briefly on korbas face it was there for anyone to read with her powers alia had but to accuse him herself saying she brought the evidence from the shadow region the alam almythal our enemies have fremen allies alia pressed water traps have been destroyed qanats blasted plantings poisoned and storage basins plundered and now theyve stolen a worm from the desert taken it to another world the voice of this intrusion was known to all of them muaddib paul came through the doorway from the hall pressed through the guard ranks and crossed to alias side chani accompanying him remained on the sidelines mlord stilgar said refusing to look at pauls face paul aimed his empty sockets at the gallery then down to korba what korba no words of praise muttering could be heard in the gallery it grew louder isolated words and phrases audible law for the blind fremen way in the desert who breaks who says im blind paul demanded he faced the gallery you rajifiri i see youre wearing gold today and that blue shirt beneath it which still has dust on it from the streets you always were untidy rajifiri made a warding gesture three fingers against evil point those fingers at yourself paul shouted we know where the evil is he turned back to korba theres guilt on your face korba not my guilt i mayve associated with the guilty but no he broke off shot a frightened look at the gallery taking her cue from paul alia arose stepped down to the floor of the chamber advanced to the edge of korbas table from a range of less than a meter she stared down at him silent and intimidating korba cowered under the burden of eyes he fidgeted shot anxious glances at the gallery whose eyes do you seek up there paul asked you can not see korba blurted paul put down a momentary feeling of pity for korba the man lay trapped in the visions snare as securely as any of those present he played a part no more i dont need eyes to see you paul said and he began describing korba every movement every twitch every alarmed and pleading look at the gallery desperation grew in korba watching him alia saw he might break any second someone in the gallery must realize how near he was to breaking she thought who she studied the faces of the naibs noting small betrayals in the masked faces angers fears uncertainties guilts paul fell silent korba mustered a pitiful air of pomposity to plead who accuses me otheym accuses you alia said but otheyms dead korba protested how did you know that paul asked through your spy system oh yes we know about your spies and couriers we know who brought the stone burner here from tarahell it was for the defense of the qizarate korba blurted is that how it got into traitorous hands paul asked it was stolen and we korba fell silent swallowed his gaze darted left and right everyone knows ive been the voice of love for muaddib he stared at the gallery how can a dead man accuse a fremen otheyms voice isnt dead alia said she stopped as paul touched her arm otheym sent us his voice paul said it gives the names the acts of treachery the meeting places and the times do you miss certain faces in the council of naibs korba where are merkur and fash keke the lame isnt with us today and takim where is he korba shook his head from side to side theyve fled arrakis with the stolen worm paul said even if i freed you now korba shaihulud would have your water for your part in this why dont i free you korba think of all those men whose eyes were taken the men who can not see as i see they have families and friends korba where could you hide from them it was an accident korba pleaded anyway theyre getting tleilaxu again he subsided who knows what bondage goes with metal eyes paul asked the naibs in their gallery began exchanging whispered comments speaking behind raised hands they gazed coldly at korba now defense of the qizarate paul murmured returning to korbas plea a device which either destroys a planet or produces jrays to blind those too near it which effect korba did you conceive as a defense does the qizarate rely on stopping the eyes of all observers it was a curiosity mlord korba pleaded we knew the old law said that only families could possess atomics but the qizarate obeyed obeyed obeyed you paul said a curiosity indeed even if its only the voice of my accuser you must face me with it korba said a fremen has rights he speaks truth sire stilgar said alia glanced sharply at stilgar the law is the law stilgar said sensing alias protest he began quoting fremen law interspersing his own comments on how the law pertained alia experienced the odd sensation she was hearing stilgars words before he spoke them how could he be this credulous stilgar had never appeared more official and conservative more intent on adhering to the dune code his chin was outthrust aggressive his mouth chopped was there really nothing in him but this outrageous pomposity korba is a fremen and must be judged by fremen law stilgar concluded alia turned away looked out at the day shadows dropping down the wall across from the garden she felt drained by frustration theyd dragged this thing along well into midmorning now what korba had relaxed the panegyrists manner said hed suffered an unjust attack that everything hed done had been for love of muaddib she glanced at korba surprised a look of sly selfimportance sliding across his face he might almost have received a message she thought he acted the part of a man whod heard friends shout hold fast help is on its way for an instant theyd held this thing in their hands the information out of the dwarf the clues that others were in the plot the names of informants but the critical moment had flown stilgar surely not stilgar she turned stared at the old fremen stilgar met her gaze without flinching thank you stil paul said for reminding us of the law stilgar inclined his head he moved close shaped silent words in a way he knew both paul and alia could read ill wring him dry and then take care of the matter paul nodded signaled the guardsmen behind korba remove korba to a maximum security cell paul said no visitors except counsel as counsel i appoint stilgar let me choose my own counsel korba shouted paul whirled you deny the fairness and judgment of stilgar oh no mlord but take him away paul barked the guardsmen lifted korba off the cushions herded him out with new mutterings the naibs began quitting their gallery attendants came from beneath the gallery crossed to the windows and drew the orange draperies orange gloom took over the chamber paul alia said when we precipitate violence paul said itll be when we have full control of it thank you stil you played your part well alia im certain has identified the naibs who were with him they couldnt help giving themselves away you cooked this up between you alia demanded had i ordered korba slain out of hand the naibs would have understood paul said but this formal procedure without strict adherence to fremen law they felt their own rights threatened which naibs were with him alia rajifiri for certain she said voice low and saajid but give stilgar the complete list paul said alia swallowed in a dry throat sharing the general fear of paul in this moment she knew how he moved among them without eyes but the delicacy of it daunted her to see their forms in the air of his vision she sensed her person shimmering for him in a sidereal time whose accord with reality depended entirely on his words and actions he held them all in the palm of his vision its past time for your morning audience sire stilgar said many people curious afraid are you afraid stil it was barely a whisper yes youre my friend and have nothing to fear from me paul said stilgar swallowed yes mlord alia take the morning audience paul said stilgar give the signal stilgar obeyed a flurry of movement erupted at the great doors a crowd was pressed back from the shadowy room to permit entrance of officials many things began happening all at once the household guard elbowing and shoving back the press of supplicants garishly robed pleaders trying to break through shouts curses pleaders waved the papers of their calling the clerk of the assemblage strode ahead of them through the opening cleared by the guard he carried the list of preferences those whod be permitted to approach the throne the clerk a wiry fremen named tecrube carried himself with weary cynicism flaunting his shaven head clumped whiskers alia moved to intercept him giving paul time to slip away with chani through the private passage behind the dais she experienced a momentary distrust of tecrube at the prying curiosity in the stare he sent after paul i speak for my brother today she said have the supplicants approach one at a time yes mlady he turned to arrange his throng i can remember a time when you wouldnt have mistaken your brothers purpose here stilgar said i was distracted she said theres been a dramatic change in you stil what is it stilgar drew himself up shocked one changed of course but dramatically this was a particular view of himself that hed never encountered drama was a questionable thing imported entertainers of dubious loyalty and more dubious virtue were dramatic enemies of the empire employed drama in their attempts to sway the fickle populace korba had slipped away from fremen virtues to employ drama for the qizarate and hed die for that youre being perverse stilgar said do you distrust me the distress in his voice softened her expression but not her tone you know i dont distrust you ive always agreed with my brother that once matters were in stilgars hands we could safely forget them then why do you say ive changed youre preparing to disobey my brother she said i can read it in you i only hope it doesnt destroy you both the first of the pleaders and supplicants were approaching now she turned away before stilgar could respond his face though was filled with the things shed sensed in her mothers letter the replacement of morality and conscience with law you produce a deadly paradox tibana was an apologist for socratic christianity probably a native of iv anbus who lived between the eight and ninth centuries before corrino likely in the second reign of dalamak of his writings only a portion survives from which this fragment is taken the hearts of all men dwell in the same wilderness from the dunebuk of irulan you are bijaz the ghola said entering the small chamber where the dwarf was held under guard i am called hayt a strong contingent of the household guard had come in with the ghola to take over the evening watch sand carried by the sunset wind had stung their cheeks while they crossed the outer yard made them blink and hurry they could be heard in the passage outside now exchanging the banter and ritual of their tasks you are not hayt the dwarf said you are duncan idaho i was there when they put your dead flesh into the tank and i was there when they removed it alive and ready for training the ghola swallowed in a throat suddenly dry the bright glowglobes of the chamber lost their yellowness in the rooms green hangings the light showed beads of perspiration on the dwarfs forehead bijaz seemed a creature of odd integrity as though the purpose fashioned into him by the tleilaxu were projected out through his skin there was power beneath the dwarfs mask of cowardice and frivolity muaddib has charged me to question you to determine what it is the tleilaxu intend you to do here hayt said tleilaxu tleilaxu the dwarf sang i am the tleilaxu you dolt for that matter so are you hayt stared at the dwarf bijaz radiated a charismatic alertness that made the observer think of ancient idols you hear that guard outside hayt asked if i gave them the order theyd strangle you hai hai bijaz cried what a callous lout youve become and you said you came seeking truth hayt found he didnt like the look of secret repose beneath the dwarfs expression perhaps i only seek the future he said well spoken bijaz said now we know each other when two thieves meet they need no introduction so were thieves hayt said what do we steal not thieves but dice bijaz said and you came here to read my spots i in turn read yours and lo you have two faces did you really see me go into the tleilaxu tanks hayt asked fighting an odd reluctance to ask that question did i not say it bijaz demanded the dwarf bounced to his feet we had a terrific struggle with you the flesh did not want to come back hayt felt suddenly that he existed in a dream controlled by some other mind and that he might momentarily forget this to become lost in the convolutions of that mind bijaz tipped his head slyly to one side walked all around the ghola staring up at him excitement kindles old patterns in you bijaz said you are the pursuer who doesnt want to find what he pursues youre a weapon aimed at muaddib hayt said swiveling to follow the dwarf what is it youre to do nothing bijaz said stopping i give you a common answer to a common question then you were aimed at alia hayt said is she your target they call her hawt the fish monster on the outworlds bijaz said how is it i hear your blood boiling when you speak of her so they call her hawt the ghola said studying bijaz for any clue to his purpose the dwarf made such odd responses she is the virginharlot bijaz said she is vulgar witty knowledgeable to a depth that terrifies cruel when she is most kind unthinking while she thinks and when she seeks to build she is as destructive as a coriolis storm so you came here to speak out against alia hayt said against her bijaz sank to a cushion against the wall i came here to be captured by the magnetism of her physical beauty he grinned a saurian expression in the bigfeatured face to attack alia is to attack her brother hayt said that is so clear it is difficult to see bijaz said in truth emperor and sister are one person back to back one being half male and half female that is a thing weve heard said by the fremen of the deep desert hayt said and those are the ones whove revived the blood sacrifice to shaihulud how is it you repeat their nonsense you dare say nonsense bijaz demanded you who are both man and mask ahh but the dice can not read their own spots i forget this and you are doubly confused because you serve the atreides doublebeing your senses are not as close to the answer as your mind is do you preach that false ritual about muaddib to your guards hayt asked his voice low he felt his mind being tangled by the dwarfs words they preach to me bijaz said and they pray why should they not all of us should pray do we not live in the shadow of the most dangerous creation the universe has ever seen dangerous creation their own mother refuses to live on the same planet with them why dont you answer me straight out hayt demanded you know we have other ways of questioning you well get our answers one way or another but i have answered you have i not said the myth is real am i the wind that carries death in its belly no i am words such words as the lightning which strikes from the sand in a dark sky i have said blow out the lamp day is here and you keep saying give me a lamp so i can find the day you play a dangerous game with me hayt said did you think i could not understand these zensunni ideas you leave tracks as clear as those of a bird in mud bijaz began to giggle why do you laugh hayt demanded because i have teeth and wish i had not bijaz managed between giggles having no teeth i could not gnash them and now i know your target hayt said you were aimed at me and ive hit it right on bijaz said you made such a big target how could i miss he nodded as though to himself now i will sing to you he began to hum a keening whining monotonous theme repeated over and over hayt stiffened experiencing odd pains that played up and down his spine he stared at the face of the dwarf seeing youthful eyes in an old face the eyes were the center of a network of knobby white lines which ran to the hollows below his temples such a large head every feature focused on the pursedup mouth from which that monotonous noise issued the sound made hayt think of ancient rituals folk memories old words and customs halfforgotten meanings in lost mutterings something vital was happening here a bloody play of ideas across time elder ideas lay tangled in the dwarfs singing it was like a blazing light in the distance coming nearer and nearer illuminating life across a span of centuries what are you doing to me hayt gasped you are the instrument i was taught to play bijaz said i am playing you let me tell you the names of the other traitors among the naibs they are bikouros and cahueit there is djedida who was secretary to korba there is abumojandis the aide to bannerjee even now one of them could be sinking a blade into your muaddib hayt shook his head from side to side he found it too difficult to talk we are like brothers bijaz said interrupting his monotonous hum once more we grew in the same tank i first and then you hayts metal eyes inflicted him with a sudden burning pain flickering red haze surrounded everything he saw he felt he had been cut away from every immediate sense except the pain and he experienced his surroundings through a thin separation like windblown gauze all had become accident the chance involvement of inanimate matter his own will was no more than a subtle shifting thing it lived without breath and was intelligible only as an inward illumination with a clarity born of desperation he broke through the gauze curtain with the lonely sense of sight his attention focused like a blazing light under bijaz hayt felt that his eyes cut through layers of the dwarf seeing the little man as a hired intellect and beneath that a creature imprisoned by hungers and cravings which lay huddled in the eyes layer after layer until finally there was only an entityaspect being manipulated by symbols we are upon a battleground bijaz said you may speak of it his voice freed by the command hayt said you can not force me to slay muaddib i have heard the bene gesserit say bijaz said that there is nothing firm nothing balanced nothing durable in all the universe that nothing remains in its state that each day sometimes each hour brings change hayt shook his head dumbly from side to side you believed the silly emperor was the prize we sought bijaz said how little you understand our masters the tleilaxu the guild and bene gesserit believe we produce artifacts in reality we produce tools and services anything can be a tool poverty war war is useful because it is effective in so many areas it stimulates the metabolism it enforces government it diffuses genetic strains it possesses a vitality such as nothing else in the universe only those who recognize the value of war and exercise it have any degree of selfdetermination in an oddly placid voice hayt said strange thoughts coming from you almost enough to make me believe in a vengeful providence what restitution was exacted to create you it would make a fascinating story doubtless with an even more extraordinary epilogue magnificent bijaz chortled you attack therefore you have willpower and exercise selfdetermination youre trying to awaken violence in me hayt said in a panting voice bijaz denied this with a shake of the head awaken yes violence no you are a disciple of awareness by training so you have said i have an awareness to awaken in you duncan idaho hayt duncan idaho killer extraordinary lover of many women swordsman soldier atreides field hand on the field of battle duncan idaho the past can not be awakened can not it has never been done true but our masters defy the idea that something can not be done always they seek the proper tool the right application of effort the services of the proper you hide your real purpose you throw up a screen of words and they mean nothing there is a duncan idaho in you bijaz said it will submit to emotion or to dispassionate examination but submit it will this awareness will rise through a screen of suppression and selection out of the dark past which dogs your footsteps it goads you even now while it holds you back there exists that being within you upon which awareness must focus and which you will obey the tleilaxu think im still their slave but i quiet slave bijaz said in that whining voice hayt found himself frozen in silence now we are down to bedrock bijaz said i know you feel it and these are the powerwords to manipulate you i think they will have sufficient leverage hayt felt the perspiration pouring down his cheeks the trembling of his chest and arms but he was powerless to move one day bijaz said the emperor will come to you he will say she is gone the grief mask will occupy his face he will give water to the dead as they call their tears hereabouts and you will say using my voice master oh master hayts jaw and throat ached with the locking of his muscles he could only twist his head in a brief arc from side to side you will say i carry a message from bijaz the dwarf grimaced poor bijaz who has no mind poor bijaz a drum stuffed with messages an essence for others to use pound on bijaz and he produces a noise again he grimaced you think me a hypocrite duncan idaho i am not i can grieve too but the time has come to substitute swords for words a hiccup shook hayt bijaz giggled then ah thank you duncan thank you the demands of the body save us as the emperor carries the blood of the harkonnens in his veins he will do as we demand he will turn into a spitting machine a biter of words that ring with a lovely noise to our masters hayt blinked thinking how the dwarf appeared like an alert little animal a thing of spite and rare intelligence harkonnen blood in the atreides you think of beast rabban the vile harkonnen and you glare bijaz said you are like the fremen in this when words fail the sword is always at hand eh you think of the torture inflicted upon your family by the harkonnens and through his mother your precious paul is a harkonnen you would not find it difficult to slay a harkonnen now would you bitter frustration coursed through the ghola was it anger why should this cause anger ohhh bijaz said and ahhhh hah clickclick there is more to the message it is a trade the tleilaxu offer your precious paul atreides our masters will restore his beloved a sister to yourself another ghola hayt felt suddenly that he existed in a universe occupied only by his own heartbeats a ghola bijaz said it will be the flesh of his beloved she will bear his children she will love only him we can even improve on the original if he so desires did ever a man have greater opportunity to regain what hed lost it is a bargain he will leap to strike bijaz nodded eyes drooping as though tiring then he will be tempted and in his distraction you will move close in the instant you will strike two gholas not one that is what our masters demand the dwarf cleared his throat nodded once more said speak i will not do it hayt said but duncan idaho would bijaz said it will be the moment of supreme vulnerability for this descendant of the harkonnens do not forget this you will suggest improvements to his beloved perhaps a deathless heart gentler emotions you will offer asylum as you move close to him a planet of his choice somewhere beyond the imperium think of it his beloved restored no more need for tears and a place of idyls to live out his years a costly package hayt said probing hell ask the price tell him he must renounce his godhead and discredit the qizarate he must discredit himself his sister nothing more hayt asked sneering he must relinquish his choam holdings naturally naturally and if youre not yet close enough to strike speak of how much the tleilaxu admire what he has taught them about the possibilities of religion tell him the tleilaxu have a department of religious engineering shaping religions to particular needs how very clever hayt said you think yourself free to sneer and disobey me bijaz said he cocked his head slyly to one side dont deny it they made you well little animal hayt said and you as well the dwarf said you will tell him to hurry flesh decays and her flesh must be preserved in a cryological tank hayt felt himself floundering caught in a matrix of objects he could not recognize the dwarf appeared so sure of himself there had to be a flaw in the tleilaxu logic in making their ghola theyd keyed him to the voice of bijaz but but what logicmatrixobject how easy it was to mistake clear reasoning for correct reasoning was tleilaxu logic distorted bijaz smiled listened as though to a hidden voice now you will forget he said when the moment comes you will remember he will say she is gone duncan idaho will awaken then the dwarf clapped his hands together hayt grunted feeling that he had been interrupted in the middle of a thought or perhaps in the middle of a sentence what was it something about targets you think to confuse me and manipulate me he said how is that bijaz asked i am your target and you cant deny it hayt said i would not think of denying it what is it youd try to do with me a kindness bijaz said a simple kindness the sequential nature of actual events is not illuminated with lengthy precision by the powers of prescience except under the most extraordinary circumstances the oracle grasps incidents cut out of the historic chain eternity moves it inflicts itself upon the oracle and the supplicant alike let muaddibs subjects doubt his majesty and his oracular visions let them deny his powers let them never doubt eternity the dune gospels hayt watched alia emerge from her temple and cross the plaza her guard was bunched close fierce expressions on their faces to mask the lines molded by good living and complacency a heliograph of thopter wings flashed in the bright afternoon sun above the temple part of the royal guard with muaddibs fistsymbol on its fuselage hayt returned his gaze to alia she looked out of place here in the city he thought her proper setting was the desert open untrammeled space an odd thing about her came back to him as he watched her approach alia appeared thoughtful only when she smiled it was a trick of the eyes he decided recalling a cameo memory of her as shed appeared at the reception for the guild ambassador haughty against a background of music and brittle conversation among extravagant gowns and uniforms and alia had been wearing white dazzling a bright garment of chastity he had looked down upon her from a window as she crossed an inner garden with its formal pond its fluting fountains fronds of pampas grass and a white belvedere entirely wrong all wrong she belonged in the desert hayt drew in a ragged breath alia had moved out of his view then as she did now he waited clenching and unclenching his fists the interview with bijaz had left him uneasy he heard alias entourage pass outside the room where he waited she went into the family quarters now he tried to focus on the thing about her which troubled him the way shed walked across the plaza yes shed moved like a hunted creature fleeing some predator he stepped out onto the connecting balcony walked along it behind the plasmeld sunscreen stopped while still in concealing shadows alia stood at the balustrade overlooking her temple he looked where she was looking out over the city he saw rectangles blocks of color creeping movements of life and sound structures gleamed shimmered heat patterns spiraled off the rooftops there was a boy across the way bouncing a ball in a culdesac formed by a buttressed massif at a corner of the temple back and forth the ball went alia too watched the ball she felt a compelling identity with that ball back and forth back and forth she sensed herself bouncing through corridors of time the potion of melange shed drained just before leaving the temple was the largest shed ever attempted a massive overdose even before beginning to take effect it had terrified her why did i do it she asked herself one made a choice between dangers was that it this was the way to penetrate the fog spread over the future by that damnable dune tarot a barrier existed it must be breached she had acted out of a necessity to see where it was her brother walked with his eyeless stride the familiar melange fugue state began creeping into her awareness she took a deep breath experienced a brittle form of calm poised and selfless possession of second sight has a tendency to make one a dangerous fatalist she thought unfortunately there existed no abstract leverage no calculus of prescience visions of the future could not be manipulated as formulas one had to enter them risking life and sanity a figure moved from the harsh shadows of the adjoining balcony the ghola in her heightened awareness alia saw him with intense clarity the dark lively features dominated by those glistening metal eyes he was a union of terrifying opposites something put together in a shocking linear way he was shadow and blazing light a product of the process which had revived his dead flesh and of something intensely pure innocent he was innocence under siege have you been there all along duncan she asked so im to be duncan he said why dont question me she said and she thought looking at him that the tleilaxu had left no corner of their ghola unfinished only gods can safely risk perfection she said its a dangerous thing for a man duncan died he said wishing she would not call him that i am hayt she studied his artificial eyes wondering what they saw observed closely they betrayed tiny black pockmarks little wells of darkness in the glittering metal facets the universe shimmered around her and lurched she steadied herself with a hand on the sunwarmed surface of the balustrade ahhh the melange moved swiftly are you ill hayt asked he moved closer the steely eyes opened wide staring who spoke she wondered was it duncan idaho was it the mentatghola or the zensunni philosopher or was it a tleilaxu pawn more dangerous than any guild steersman her brother knew again she looked at the ghola there was something inactive about him now a latent something he was saturated with waiting and with powers beyond their common life out of my mother i am like the bene gesserit she said do you know that i know it i use their powers think as they think part of me knows the sacred urgency of the breeding program and its products she blinked feeling part of her awareness begin to move freely in time its said that the bene gesserit never let go he said and he watched her closely noting how white her knuckles were where she gripped the edge of the balcony have i stumbled she asked he marked how deeply she breathed with tension in every movement the glazed appearance of her eyes when you stumble he said you may regain your balance by jumping beyond the thing that tripped you the bene gesserit stumbled she said now they wish to regain their balance by leaping beyond my brother they want chanis baby or mine are you with child she struggled to fix herself in a timespace relationship to this question with child when where i see my child she whispered she moved away from the balconys edge turned her head to look at the ghola he had a face of salt bitter eyes two circles of glistening lead and as he turned away from the light to follow her movement blue shadows what do you see with such eyes she whispered what other eyes see he said his words rang in her ears stretching her awareness she felt that she reached across the universe such a stretching out out she lay intertwined with all time youve taken the spice a large dose he said why cant i see him she muttered the womb of all creation held her captive tell me duncan why i can not see him who cant you see i can not see the father of my children im lost in a tarot fog help me mentat logic offered its prime computation and he said the bene gesserit want a mating between you and your brother it would lock the genetic a wail escaped her the egg in the flesh she gasped a sensation of chill swept over her followed by intense heat the unseen mate of her darkest dreams flesh of her flesh that the oracle could not reveal would it come to that have you risked a dangerous dose of the spice he asked something within him fought to express the utmost terror at the thought that an atreides woman might die that paul might face him with the knowledge that a female of the royal family had gone you dont know what its like to hunt the future she said sometimes i glimpse myself but i get in my own way i can not see through myself she lowered her head shook it from side to side how much of the spice did you take he asked nature abhors prescience she said raising her head did you know that duncan he spoke softly reasonably as to a small child tell me how much of the spice you took he took hold of her shoulder with his left hand words are such gross machinery so primitive and ambiguous she said she pulled away from his hand you must tell me he said look at the shield wall she commanded pointing she sent her gaze along her own outstretched hand trembled as the landscape crumbled in an overwhelming vision a sandcastle destroyed by invisible waves she averted her eyes was transfixed by the appearance of the gholas face his features crawled became aged then young aged young he was life itself assertive endless she turned to flee but he grabbed her left wrist i am going to summon a doctor he said no you must let me have the vision i have to know you are going inside now he said she stared down at his hand where their flesh touched she felt an electric presence that both lured and frightened her she jerked free gasped you cant hold the whirlwind you must have medical help he snapped dont you understand she demanded my visions incomplete just fragments it flickers and jumps i have to remember the future cant you see that what is the future if you die he asked forcing her gently into the family chambers words words she muttered i cant explain it one thing is the occasion of another thing but theres no cause no effect we cant leave the universe as it was try as we may theres a gap stretch out here he commanded he is so dense she thought cool shadows enveloped her she felt her own muscles crawling like worms a firm bed that she knew to be insubstantial only space was permanent nothing else had substance the bed flowed with many bodies all of them her own time became a multiple sensation overloaded it presented no single reaction for her to abstract it was time it moved the whole universe slipped backward forward sideways it has no thingaspect she explained you cant get under it or around it theres no place to get leverage there came a fluttering of people all around her many someones held her left hand she looked at her own moving flesh followed a twining arm out to a fluid mask of face duncan idaho his eyes were wrong but it was duncan childmanadolescentchildmanadolescent every line of his features betrayed concern for her duncan dont be afraid she whispered he squeezed her hand nodded be still he said and he thought she must not die she must not no atreides woman can die he shook his head sharply such thoughts defied mentat logic death was a necessity that life might continue the ghola loves me alia thought the thought became bedrock to which she might cling he was a familiar face with a solid room behind him she recognized one of the bedrooms in pauls suite a fixed immutable person did something with a tube in her throat she fought against retching we got her in time a voice said and she recognized the tones of a family medic you shouldve called me sooner there was suspicion in the medics voice she felt the tube slide out of her throat a snake a shimmering cord the slapshot will make her sleep the medic said ill send one of her attendants to i will stay with her the ghola said that is not seemly the medic snapped stay duncan alia whispered he stroked her hand to tell her hed heard mlady the medic said itd be better if you do not tell me what is best she rasped her throat ached with each syllable mlady the medic said voice accusing you know the dangers of consuming too much melange i can only assume someone gave it to you without you are a fool she rasped would you deny me my visions i knew what i took and why she put a hand to her throat leave us at once the medic pulled out of her field of vision said i will send word to your brother she felt him leave turned her attention to the ghola the vision lay clearly in her awareness now a culture medium in which the present grew outward she sensed the ghola move in that play of time no longer cryptic fixed now against a recognizable background he is the crucible she thought he is danger and salvation and she shuddered knowing she saw the vision of her brother had seen unwanted tears burned her eyes she shook her head sharply no tears they wasted moisture and worse distracted the harsh flow of vision paul must be stopped once just once she had bridged time to place her voice where he would pass but stress and mutability would not permit that here the web of time passed through her brother now like rays of light through a lens he stood at the focus and he knew it he had gathered all the lines to himself and would not permit them to escape or change why she muttered is it hate does he strike out at time itself because it hurt him is that it hate thinking he heard her speak his name the ghola said mlady if i could only burn this thing out of me she cried i didnt want to be different please alia he murmured let yourself sleep i wanted to be able to laugh she whispered tears slid down her cheeks but im sister to an emperor whos worshipped as a god people fear me i never wanted to be feared he wiped the tears from her face i dont want to be part of history she whispered i just want to be loved and to love you are loved he said ahhh loyal loyal duncan she said please dont call me that he pleaded but you are she said and loyalty is a valued commodity it can be sold not bought but sold i dont like your cynicism he said damn your logic its true sleep he said do you love me duncan she asked yes is that one of those lies she asked one of the lies that are easier to believe than the truth why am i afraid to believe you you fear my differences as you fear your own be a man not a mentat she snarled i am a mentat and a man will you make me your woman then i will do what love demands and loyalty and loyalty thats where youre dangerous she said her words disturbed him no sign of the disturbance arose to his face no muscle trembled but she knew it visionmemory exposed the disturbance she felt she had missed part of the vision though that she should remember something else from the future there existed another perception which did not go precisely by the senses a thing which fell into her head from nowhere the way prescience did it lay in the time shadows infinitely painful emotion that was it emotion it had appeared in the vision not directly but as a product from which she could infer what lay behind she had been possessed by emotion a single constriction made up of fear grief and love they lay there in the vision all collected into a single epidemic body overpowering and primordial duncan dont let me go she whispered sleep he said dont fight it i must i must hes the bait in his own trap hes the servant of power and terror violence deification is a prison enclosing him hell lose everything itll tear him apart you speak of paul they drive him to destroy himself she gasped arching her back too much weight too much grief they seduce him away from love she sank back to the bed theyre creating a universe where he wont permit himself to live who is doing this he is ohhh youre so dense hes part of the pattern and its too late too late too late as she spoke she felt her awareness descend layer by layer it came to rest directly behind her navel body and mind separated and merged in a storehouse of relic visions moving moving she heard a fetal heartbeat a child of the future the melange still possessed her then setting her adrift in time she knew she had tasted the life of a child not yet conceived one thing certain about this child it would suffer the same awakening she had suffered it would be an aware thinking entity before birth there exists a limit to the force even the most powerful may apply without destroying themselves judging this limit is the true artistry of government misuse of power is the fatal sin the law can not be a tool of vengeance never a hostage nor a fortification against the martyrs it has created you can not threaten any individual and escape the consequences muaddib on law the stilgar commentary chani stared out at the morning desert framed in the fault cleft below sietch tabr she wore no stillsuit and this made her feel unprotected here in the desert the sietch grottos entrance lay hidden in the buttressed cliff above and behind her the desert the desert she felt that the desert had followed her wherever she had gone coming back to the desert was not so much a homecoming as a turning around to see what had always been there a painful constriction surged through her abdomen the birth would be soon she fought down the pain wanting this moment alone with her desert dawn stillness gripped the land shadows fled among the dunes and terraces of the shield wall all around daylight lunged over the high scarp and plunged her up to her eyes in a bleak landscape stretching beneath a washed blue sky the scene matched the feeling of dreadful cynicism which had tormented her since the moment shed learned of pauls blindness why are we here she wondered it was not a hajra a journey of seeking paul sought nothing here except perhaps a place for her to give birth he had summoned odd companions for this journey she thought bijaz the tleilaxu dwarf the ghola hayt who might be duncan idahos revenant edric the guild steersmanambassador gaius helen mohiam the bene gesserit reverend mother he so obviously hated lichna otheyms strange daughter who seemed unable to move beyond the watchful eyes of guards stilgar her uncle of the naibs and his favorite wife harah and irulan alia the sound of wind through the rocks accompanied her thoughts the desert day had become yellow on yellow tan on tan gray on gray why such a strange mixture of companions we have forgotten paul had said in response to her question that the word company originally meant traveling companions we are a company but what value are they there hed said turning his frightful sockets toward her weve lost that clear singlenote of living if it can not be bottled beaten pointed or hoarded we give it no value hurt shed said thats not what i meant ahhh dearest one hed said soothing we are so moneyrich and so lifepoor i am evil obstinate stupid you are not that too is true but my hands are blue with time i think i think i tried to invent life not realizing itd already been invented and hed touched her abdomen to feel the new life there remembering she placed both hands over her abdomen and trembled sorry that shed asked paul to bring her here the desert wind had stirred up evil odors from the fringe plantings which anchored the dunes at the cliff base fremen superstition gripped her evil odors evil times she faced into the wind saw a worm appear outside the plantings it arose like the prow of a demon ship out of the dunes threshed sand smelled the water deadly to its kind and fled beneath a long burrowing mound she hated the water then inspired by the worms fear water once the spiritsoul of arrakis had become a poison water brought pestilence only the desert was clean below her a fremen work gang appeared they climbed to the sietchs middle entrance and she saw that they had muddy feet fremen with muddy feet the children of the sietch began singing to the morning above her their voices piping from the upper entrance the voices made her feel time fleeing from her like hawks before the wind she shuddered what storms did paul see with his eyeless vision she sensed a vicious madman in him someone weary of songs and polemics the sky she noted had become crystal gray filled with alabaster rays bizarre designs etched across the heavens by windborne sand a line of gleaming white in the south caught her attention eves suddenly alerted she interpreted the sign white sky in the south shaihuluds mouth a storm came big wind she felt the warning breeze a crystal blowing of sand against her cheeks the incense of death came on the wind odors of water flowing in qanats sweating sand flint the water that was why shaihulud sent his coriolis wind hawks appeared in the cleft where she stood seeking safety from the wind they were brown as the rocks and with scarlet in their wings she felt her spirit go out to them they had a place to hide she had none mlady the wind comes she turned saw the ghola calling to her outside the upper entrance to the sietch fremen fears gripped her clean death and the bodys water claimed for the tribe these she understood but something brought back from death windblown sand whipped at her reddened her cheeks she glanced over her shoulder at the frightful band of dust across the sky the desert beneath the storm had taken on a tawny restless appearance as though dune waves beat on a tempest shore the way paul had once described a sea she hesitated caught by a feeling of the deserts transience measured against eternity this was no more than a caldron dune surf thundered against cliffs the storm out there had become a universal thing for her all the animals hiding from it nothing left of the desert but its own private sounds blown sand scraping along rock a windsurge whistling the gallop of a boulder tumbled suddenly from its hill then somewhere out of sight a capsized worm thumping its idiot way aright and slithering off to its dry depths it was only a moment as her life measured time but in that moment she felt this planet being swept away cosmic dust part of other waves we must hurry the ghola said from right beside her she sensed fear in him then concern for her safety itll shred the flesh from your bones he said as though he needed to explain such a storm to her her fear of him dispelled by his obvious concern chani allowed the ghola to help her up the rock stairway to the sietch they entered the twisting baffle which protected the entrance attendants opened the moisture seals closed them behind sietch odors assaulted her nostrils the place was a ferment of nasal memories the warren closeness of bodies rank esters of the reclamation stills familiar food aromas the flinty burning of machines at work and through it all the omnipresent spice melange everywhere she took a deep breath home the ghola took his hand from her arm stood aside a patient figure now almost as though turned off when not in use yet he watched chani hesitated in the entrance chamber puzzled by something she could not name this was truly her home as a child shed hunted scorpions here by glowglobe light something was changed though shouldnt you be going to your quarters mlady the ghola asked as though ignited by his words a rippling birth constriction seized her abdomen she fought against revealing it mlady the ghola said why is paul afraid for me to bear our children she asked it is a natural thing to fear for your safety the ghola said she put a hand to her cheek where the sand had reddened it and he doesnt fear for the children mlady he can not think of a child without remembering that your firstborn was slain by the sardaukar she studied the ghola flat face unreadable mechanical eyes was he truly duncan idaho this creature was he friend to anyone had he spoken truthfully now you should be with the medics the ghola said again she heard the fear for her safety in his voice she felt abruptly that her mind lay undefended ready to be invaded by shocking perceptions hayt im afraid she whispered where is my usul affairs of state detain him the ghola said she nodded thinking of the government apparatus which had accompanied them in a great flight of ornithopters abruptly she realized what puzzled her about the sietch outworld odors the clerks and aides had brought their own perfumes into this environment aromas of diet and clothing of exotic toiletries they were an undercurrent of odors here chani shook herself concealing an urge to bitter laughter even the smells changed in muaddibs presence there were pressing matters which he could not defer the ghola said misreading her hesitation yes yes i understand i came with that swarm too recalling the flight from arrakeen she admitted to herself now that she had not expected to survive it paul had insisted on piloting his own thopter eyeless he had guided the machine here after that experience she knew nothing he did could surprise her another pain fanned out through her abdomen the ghola saw her indrawn breath the tightening of her cheeks said is it your time i yes it is you must not delay he said he grasped her arm hurried her down the hall she sensed panic in him said theres time he seemed not to hear the zensunni approach to birth he said urging her even faster is to wait without purpose in the state of highest tension do not compete with what is happening to compete is to prepare for failure do not be trapped by the need to achieve anything this way you achieve everything while he spoke they reached the entrance to her quarters he thrust her through the hangings cried out harah harah it is chanis time summon the medics his call brought attendants running there was a great bustling of people in which chani felt herself an isolated island of calm until the next pain came hayt dismissed to the outer passage took time to wonder at his own actions he felt fixated at some point of time where all truths were only temporary panic lay beneath his actions he realized panic centered not on the possibility that chani might die but that paul should come to him afterward filled with grief his loved one gone gone something can not emerge from nothing the ghola told himself from what does this panic emerge he felt that his mentat faculties had been dulled let out a long shuddering breath a psychic shadow passed over him in the emotional darkness of it he felt himself waiting for some absolute sound the snap of a branch in a jungle a sigh shook him danger had passed without striking slowly marshaling his powers shedding bits of inhibition he sank into mentat awareness he forced it not the best way but somehow necessary ghost shadows moved within him in place of people he was a transshipping station for every datum he had ever encountered his being was inhabited by creatures of possibility they passed in review to be compared judged perspiration broke out on his forehead thoughts with fuzzy edges feathered away into darkness unknown infinite systems a mentat could not function without realizing he worked in infinite systems fixed knowledge could not surround the infinite everywhere could not be brought into finite perspective instead he must become the infinite momentarily in one gestalten spasm he had it seeing bijaz seated before him blazing from some inner fire bijaz the dwarf had done something to him hayt felt himself teetering on the lip of a deadly pit he projected the mentat computation line forward seeing what could develop out of his own actions a compulsion he gasped ive been rigged with a compulsion a bluerobed courier passing as hayt spoke hesitated did you say something sirra not looking at him the ghola nodded i said everything there was a man so wise he jumped into a sandy place and burnt out both his eyes and when he knew his eyes were gone he offered no complaint he summoned up a vision and made himself a saint childrens verse from history of muaddib paul stood in darkness outside the sietch oracular vision told him it was night that moonlight silhouetted the shrine atop chin rock high on his left this was a memorysaturated place his first sietch where he and chani i must not think of chani he told himself the thinning cup of his vision told him of changes all around a cluster of palms far down to the right the blacksilver line of a qanat carrying water through the dunes piled up by that mornings storm water flowing in the desert he recalled another kind of water flowing in a river of his birthworld caladan he hadnt realized then the treasure of such a flow even the murky slithering in a qanat across a desert basin treasure with a delicate cough an aide came up from behind paul held out his hands for a magnabord with a single sheet of metallic paper on it he moved as sluggishly as the qanats water the vision flowed but he found himself increasingly reluctant to move with it pardon sire the aide said the semboule treaty your signature i can read it paul snapped he scrawled atreides imper in the proper place returned the board thrusting it directly into the aides outstretched hand aware of the fear this inspired the man fled paul turned away ugly barren land he imagined it sunsoaked and monstrous with heat a place of sandslides and the drowned darkness of dust pools blowdevils unreeling tiny dunes across the rocks their narrow bellies full of ochre crystals but it was a rich land too big exploding out of narrow places with vistas of stormtrodden emptiness rampart cliffs and tumbledown ridges all it required was water and love life changed those irascible wastes into shapes of grace and movement he thought that was the message of the desert contrast stunned him with realization he wanted to turn to the aides massed in the sietch entrance shout at them if you need something to worship then worship life all life every last crawling bit of it were all in this beauty together they wouldnt understand in the desert they were endlessly desert growing things performed no green ballet for them he clenched his fists at his sides trying to halt the vision he wanted to flee from his own mind it was a beast come to devour him awareness lay in him sodden heavy with all the living it had sponged up saturated with too many experiences desperately paul squeezed his thoughts outward stars awareness turned over at the thought of all those stars above him an infinite volume a man must be half mad to imagine he could rule even a teardrop of that volume he couldnt begin to imagine the number of subjects his imperium claimed subjects worshippers and enemies more likely did any among them see beyond rigid beliefs where was one man whod escaped the narrow destiny of his prejudices not even an emperor escaped hed lived a take everything life tried to create a universe in his own image but the exultant universe was breaking across him at last with its silent waves i spit on dune he thought i give it my moisture this myth hed made out of intricate movements and imagination out of moonlight and love out of prayers older than adam and gray cliffs and crimson shadows laments and rivers of martyrs what had it come to at last when the waves receded the shores of time would spread out there clean empty shining with infinite grains of memory and little else was this the golden genesis of man sand scuffed against rocks told him that the ghola had joined him youve been avoiding me today duncan paul said its dangerous for you to call me that the ghola said i know i came to warn you mlord i know the story of the compulsion bijaz had put on him poured from the ghola then do you know the nature of the compulsion paul asked violence paul felt himself arriving at a place which had claimed him from the beginning he stood suspended the jihad had seized him fixed him onto a glidepath from which the terrible gravity of the future would never release him therell be no violence from duncan paul whispered but sire tell me what you see around us paul said mlord the desert how is it tonight dont you see it i have no eyes duncan but ive only my vision paul said and wish i didnt have it im dying of prescience did you know that duncan perhaps what you fear wont happen the ghola said what deny my own oracle how can i when ive seen it fulfilled thousands of time people call it a power a gift its an affliction it wont let me leave my life where i found it mlord the ghola muttered i it isnt young master you dont i he fell silent paul sensed the gholas confusion said whatd you call me duncan what what i for a moment you called me young master i did yes thats what duncan always called me paul reached out touched the gholas face was that part of your tleilaxu training no paul lowered his hand what then it came from me do you serve two masters perhaps free yourself from the ghola duncan how youre human do a human thing im a ghola but your flesh is human duncans in there somethings in there i care not how you do it paul said but youll do it youve foreknowledge foreknowledge be damned paul turned away his vision hurtled forward now gaps in it but it wasnt a thing to be stopped mlord if youve quiet paul held up a hand did you hear that hear what mlord paul shook his head duncan hadnt heard it had he only imagined the sound itd been his tribal name called from the desert far away and low usul uuuussssuuuullll what is it mlord paul shook his head he felt watched something out there in the night shadows knew he was here something no someone it was mostly sweet he whispered and you were the sweetest of all whatd you say mlord its the future paul said that amorphous human universe out there had undergone a spurt of motion dancing to the tune of his vision it had struck a powerful note then the ghostechoes might endure i dont understand mlord the ghola said a fremen dies when hes too long from the desert paul said they call it the water sickness isnt that odd thats very odd paul strained at memories tried to recall the sound of chani breathing beside him in the night where is there comfort he wondered all he could remember was chani at breakfast the day theyd left for the desert shed been restless irritable why do you wear that old jacket shed demanded eyeing the black uniform coat with its red hawk crest beneath his fremen robes youre an emperor even an emperor has his favorite clothing hed said for no reason he could explain this had brought real tears to chanis eyes the second time in her life when fremen inhibitions had been shattered now in the darkness paul rubbed his own cheeks felt moisture there who gives moisture to the dead he wondered it was his own face yet not his the wind chilled the wet skin a frail dream formed broke what was this swelling in his breast was it something hed eaten how bitter and plaintive was this other self giving moisture to the dead the wind bristled with sand the skin dry now was his own but whose was the quivering which remained they heard the wailing then far away in the sietch depths it grew louder louder the ghola whirled at a sudden glare of light someone flinging wide the entrance seals in the light he saw a man with a raffish grin no not a grin but a grimace of grief it was a fedaykin lieutenant named tandis behind him came a press of many people all fallen silent now that they saw muaddib chani tandis said is dead paul whispered i heard her call he turned toward the sietch he knew this place it was a place where he could not hide his onrushing vision illuminated the entire fremen mob he saw tandis felt the fedaykins grief the fear and anger she is gone paul said the ghola heard the words out of a blazing corona they burned his chest his backbone the sockets of his metal eyes he felt his right hand move toward the knife at his belt his own thinking became strange disjointed he was a puppet held fast by strings reaching down from that awful corona he moved to anothers commands to anothers desires the strings jerked his arms his legs his jaw sounds came squeezing out of his mouth a terrifying repetitive noise hrrak hraak hraak the knife came up to strike in that instant he grabbed his own voice shaped rasping words run young master run we will not run paul said well move with dignity well do what must be done the gholas muscles locked he shuddered swayed what must be done the words rolled in his mind like a great fish surfacing what must be done ahhh that had sounded like the old duke pauls grandfather the young master had some of the old man in him what must be done the words began to unfold in the gholas consciousness a sensation of living two lives simultaneously spread out through his awareness haytidahohaytidaho he became a motionless chain of relative existence singular alone old memories flooded his mind he marked them adjusted them to new understandings made a beginning at the integration of a new awareness a new persona achieved a temporary form of internal tyranny the masculating synthesis remained charged with potential disorder but events pressed him to the temporary adjustment the young master needed him it was done then he knew himself as duncan idaho remembering everything of hayt as though it had been stored secretly in him and ignited by a flaming catalyst the corona dissolved he shed the tleilaxu compulsions stay close to me duncan paul said ill need to depend on you for many things and as idaho continued to stand entranced duncan yes i am duncan of course you are this was the moment when you came back well go inside now idaho fell into step beside paul it was like the old times yet not like them now that he stood free of the tleilaxu he could appreciate what they had given him zensunni training permitted him to overcome the shock of events the mentat accomplishment formed a counterbalance he put off all fear standing above the source his entire consciousness looked outward from a position of infinite wonder he had been dead he was alive sire the fedaykin tandis said as they approached him the woman lichna says she must see you i told her to wait thank you paul said the birth i spoke to the medics tandis said falling into step they said you have two children both of them alive and sound two paul stumbled caught himself on idahos arm a boy and a girl tandis said i saw them theyre good fremen babies how how did she die paul whispered mlord tandis bent close chani paul said it was the birth mlord tandis husked they said her body was drained by the speed of it i dont understand but that is what they said take me to her paul whispered mlord take me to her thats where were going mlord again tandis bent close to paul why does your ghola carry a bared knife duncan put away your knife paul said the time for violence is past as he spoke paul felt closer to the sound of his voice than to the mechanism which had created the sound two babies the vision had contained but one yet these moments went as the vision went there was a person here who felt grief and anger someone his own awareness lay in the grip of an awful treadmill replaying his life from memory two babies again he stumbled chani chani he thought there was no other way chani beloved believe me that this death was quicker for you and kinder theyd have held our children hostage displayed you in a cage and slave pits reviled you with the blame for my death this way this way we destroy them and save our children children once more he stumbled i permitted this he thought i should feel guilty the sound of noisy confusion filled the cavern ahead of them it grew louder precisely as he remembered it growing louder yes this was the pattern the inexorable pattern even with two children chani is dead he told himself at some faraway instant in a past which he had shared with others this future had reached down to him it had chivvied him and herded him into a chasm whose walls grew narrower and narrower he could feel them closing in on him this was the way the vision went chani is dead i should abandon myself to grief but that was not the way the vision went has alia been summoned he asked she is with chanis friends tandis said paul sensed the mob pressing back to give him passage their silence moved ahead of him like a wave the noisy confusion began dying down a sense of congested emotion filled the sietch he wanted to remove the people from his vision found it impossible every face turning to follow him carried its special imprint they were pitiless with curiosity those faces they felt grief yes but he understood the cruelty which drenched them they were watching the articulate become dumb the wise become a fool didnt the clown always appeal to cruelty this was more than a deathwatch less than a wake paul felt his soul begging for respite but still the vision moved him just a little farther now he told himself black visionless dark awaited him just ahead there lay the place ripped out of the vision by grief and guilt the place where the moon fell he stumbled into it wouldve fallen had idaho not taken his arm in a fierce grip a solid presence knowing how to share his grief in silence here is the place tandis said watch your step sire idaho said helping him over an entrance lip hangings brushed pauls face idaho pulled him to a halt paul felt the room then a reflection against his cheeks and ears it was a rockwalled space with the rock hidden behind tapestries where is chani paul whispered harahs voice answered him she is right here usul paul heaved a trembling sigh he had feared her body already had been removed to the stills where fremen reclaimed the water of the tribe was that the way the vision went he felt abandoned in his blindness the children paul asked they are here too mlord idaho said you have beautiful twins usul harah said a boy and a girl see we have them here in a creche two children paul thought wonderingly the vision had contained only a daughter he cast himself adrift from idahos arm moved toward the place where harah had spoken stumbled into a hard surface his hands explored it the metaglass outlines of a creche someone took his left arm usul it was harah she guided his hand into the creche he felt softsoft flesh it was so warm he felt ribs breathing that is your son harah whispered she moved his hand and this is your daughter her hand tightened on his usul are you truly blind now he knew what she was thinking the blind must be abandoned in the desert fremen tribes carried no dead weight take me to chani paul said ignoring her question harah turned him guided him to the left paul felt himself accepting now the fact that chani was dead he had taken his place in a universe he did not want wearing flesh that did not fit every breath he drew bruised his emotions two children he wondered if he had committed himself to a passage where his vision would never return it seemed unimportant where is my brother it was alias voice behind him he heard the rush of her the overwhelming presence as she took his arm from harah i must speak to you alia hissed in a moment paul said now its about lichna i know paul said in a moment you dont have a moment i have many moments but chani doesnt be still he ordered chani is dead he put a hand across her mouth as she started to protest i order you to be still he felt her subside and removed his hand describe what you see he said paul frustration and tears battled in her voice never mind he said and he forced himself to inner stillness opened the eyes of his vision to this moment yes it was still here chanis body lay on a pallet within a ring of light someone had straightened her white robe smoothed it trying to hide the blood from the birth no matter he could not turn his awareness from the vision of her face such a mirror of eternity in the still features he turned away but the vision moved with him she was gone never to return the air the universe all vacant everywhere vacant was this the essence of his penance he wondered he wanted tears but they would not come had he lived too long a fremen this death demanded its moisture nearby a baby cried and was hushed the sound pulled a curtain on his vision paul welcomed the darkness this is another world he thought two children the thought came out of some lost oracular trance he tried to recapture the timeless minddilation of the melange but awareness fell short no burst of the future came into this new consciousness he felt himself rejecting the future any future goodbye my sihaya he whispered alias voice harsh and demanding came from somewhere behind him ive brought lichna paul turned thats not lichna he said thats a face dancer lichnas dead but hear what she says alia said slowly paul moved toward his sisters voice im not surprised to find you alive atreides the voice was like lichnas but with subtle differences as though the speaker used lichnas vocal cords but no longer bothered to control them sufficiently paul found himself struck by an odd note of honesty in the voice not surprised paul asked i am scytale a tleilaxu of the face dancers and i would know a thing before we bargain is that a ghola i see behind you or duncan idaho its duncan idaho paul said and i will not bargain with you i think youll bargain scytale said duncan paul said speaking over his shoulder will you kill this tleilaxu if i ask it yes mlord there was the suppressed rage of a berserker in idahos voice wait alia said you dont know what youre rejecting but i do know paul said so its truly duncan idaho of the atreides scytale said we found the lever a ghola can regain his past paul heard footsteps someone brushed past him on the left scytales voice came from behind him now what do you remember of your past duncan everything from my childhood on i even remember you at the tank when they removed me from it idaho said wonderful scytale breathed wonderful paul heard the voice moving i need a vision he thought darkness frustrated him bene gesserit training warned him of terrifying menace in scytale yet the creature remained a voice a shadow of movement entirely beyond him are these the atreides babies scytale asked harah paul cried get her away from there stay where you are scytale shouted all of you i warn you a face dancer can move faster than you suspect my knife can have both these lives before you touch me paul felt someone touch his right arm then move off to the right thats far enough alia scytale said alia paul said dont its my fault alia groaned my fault atreides scytale said shall we bargain now behind him paul heard a single hoarse curse his throat constricted at the suppressed violence in idahos voice idaho must not break scytale would kill the babies to strike a bargain one requires a thing to sell scytale said not so atreides will you have your chani back we can restore her to you a ghola atreides a ghola with full memory but we must hurry call your friends to bring a cryologic tank to preserve the flesh to hear chanis voice once more paul thought to feel her presence beside me ahhh thats why they gave me idaho as a ghola to let me discover how much the recreation is like the original but now full restoration at their price id be a tleilaxu tool forevermore and chani chained to the same fate by a threat to our children exposed once more to the qizarates plotting what pressures would you use to restore chanis memory to her paul asked fighting to keep his voice calm would you condition her to to kill one of her own children we use whatever pressures we need scytale said what say you atreides alia paul said bargain with this thing i can not bargain with what i can not see a wise choice scytale gloated well alia what do you offer me as your brothers agent paul lowered his head bringing himself to stillness within stillness hed glimpsed something just then like a vision but not a vision it had been a knife close to him there give me a moment to think alia said my knife is patient scytale said but chanis flesh is not take a reasonable amount of time paul felt himself blinking it could not be but it was he felt eyes their vantage point was odd and they moved in an erratic way there the knife swam into his view with a breathstilling shock paul recognized the viewpoint it was that of one of his children he was seeing scytales knife hand from within the creche it glittered only inches from him yes and he could see himself across the room as well head down standing quietly a figure of no menace ignored by the others in this room to begin you might assign us all your choam holdings scytale suggested all of them alia protested all watching himself through the eyes in the creche paul slipped his crysknife from its belt sheath the movement produced a strange sensation of duality he measured the distance the angle thered be no second chance he prepared his body then in the bene gesserit way armed himself like a cocked spring for a single concentrated movement a prajna thing requiring all his muscles balanced in one exquisite unity the crysknife leaped from his hand the milky blur of it flashed into scytales right eye jerked the face dancers head back scytale threw both hands up and staggered backward against the wall his knife clattered off the ceiling to hit the floor scytale rebounded from the wall he fell face forward dead before he touched the floor still through the eyes in the creche paul watched the faces in the room turn toward his eyeless figure read the combined shock then alia rushed to the creche bent over it and hid the view from him oh theyre safe alia said theyre safe mlord idaho whispered was that part of your vision no he waved a hand in idahos direction let it be forgive me paul alia said but when that creature said they could revive there are some prices an atreides can not pay paul said you know that i know she sighed but i was tempted who was not tempted paul asked he turned away from them groped his way to a wall leaned against it and tried to understand what he had done how how the eyes in the creche he felt poised on the brink of terrifying revelation my eyes father the wordshapings shimmered before his sightless vision my son paul whispered too low for any to hear youre aware yes father look paul sagged against the wall in a spasm of dizziness he felt that hed been upended and drained his own life whipped past him he saw his father he was his father and the grandfather and the grandfathers before that his awareness tumbled through a mindshattering corridor of his whole male line how he asked silently faint wordshapings appeared faded and were gone as though the strain was too great paul wiped saliva from the corner of his mouth he remembered the awakening of alia in the lady jessicas womb but there had been no water of life no overdose of melange this time or had there had chanis hunger been for that or was this somehow the genetic product of his line foreseen by the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam paul felt himself in the creche then with alia cooing over him her hands soothed him her face loomed a giant thing directly over him she turned him then and he saw his creche companion a girl with that bonyribbed look of strength which came from a desert heritage she had a full head of tawny red hair as he stared she opened her eyes those eyes chani peered out of her eyes and the lady jessica a multitude peered out of those eyes look at that alia said theyre staring at each other babies cant focus at this age harah said i could alia said slowly paul felt himself being disengaged from that endless awareness he was back at his own wailing wall then leaning against it idaho shook his shoulder gently mlord let my son be called leto for my father paul said straightening at the time of naming harah said i will stand beside you as a friend of the mother and give that name and my daughter paul said let her be called ghanima usul harah objected ghanimas an illomened name it saved your life paul said what matter that alia made fun of you with that name my daughter is ghanima a spoil of war paul heard wheels squeak behind him then the pallet with chanis body being moved the chant of the water rite began hal yawm harah said i must leave now if i am to be the observer of the holy truth and stand beside my friend for the last time her water belongs to the tribe her water belongs to the tribe paul murmured he heard harah leave he groped outward and found idahos sleeve take me to my quarters duncan inside his quarters he shook himself free gently it was a time to be alone but before idaho could leave there was a disturbance at the door master it was bijaz calling from the doorway duncan paul said let him come two paces forward kill him if he comes farther ayyah idaho said duncan is it bijaz asked is it truly duncan idaho it is idaho said i remember then scytales plan succeeded scytale is dead paul said but i am not and the plan is not bijaz said by the tank in which i grew it can be done i shall have my pasts all of them it needs only the right trigger trigger paul asked the compulsion to kill you idaho said rage thick in his voice mentat computation they found that i thought of you as the son i never had rather than slay you the true duncan idaho would take over the ghola body but it might have failed tell me dwarf if your plan had failed if id killed him what then oh then wed have bargained with the sister to save her brother but this way the bargaining is better paul took a shuddering breath he could hear the mourners moving down the last passage now toward the deep rooms and the water stills its not too late mlord bijaz said will you have your love back we can restore her to you a ghola yes but now we hold out the full restoration shall we summon servants with a cryological tank preserve the flesh of your beloved it was harder now paul found he had exhausted his powers in the first tleilaxu temptation and now all that was for nothing to feel chanis presence once more silence him paul told idaho speaking in atreides battle tongue he heard idaho move toward the door master bijaz squeaked as you love me paul said still in battle tongue do me this favor kill him before i succumb noooooo bijaz screamed the sound stopped abruptly with a frightened grunt i did him the kindness idaho said paul bent his head listening he no longer could hear the mourners he thought of the ancient fremen rite being performed now deep in the sietch far down in the room of the deathstill where the tribe recovered its water there was no choice paul said you understand that duncan i understand there are some things no one can bear i meddled in all the possible futures i could create until finally they created me mlord you shouldnt there are problems in this universe for which there are no answers paul said nothing nothing can be done as he spoke paul felt his link with the vision shatter his mind cowered overwhelmed by infinite possibilities his lost vision became like the wind blowing where it willed we say of muaddib that he has gone on a journey into that land where we walk without footprints preamble to the qizarate creed there was a dike of water against the sand an outer limit for the plantings of the sietch holding a rock bridge came next and then the open desert beneath idahos feet the promontory of sietch tabr dominated the night sky behind him the light of both moons frosted its high rim an orchard had been brought right down to the water idaho paused on the desert side and stared back at flowered branches over silent water reflections and reality four moons the stillsuit felt greasy against his skin wet flint odors invaded his nostrils past the filters there was a malignant simpering to the wind through the orchard he listened for night sounds kangaroo mice inhabited the grass at the water verge a hawk owl bounced its droning call into the cliff shadows the windbroken hiss of a sandfall came from the open bled idaho turned toward the sound he could see no movement out there on the moonlit dunes it was tandis who had brought paul this far then the man had returned to tell his account and paul had walked out into the desert like a fremen he was blind truly blind tandis had said as though that explained it before that he had the vision which he told to us but a shrug blind fremen were abandoned in the desert muaddib might be emperor but he was also fremen had he not made provision that fremen guard and raise his children he was fremen it was a skeleton desert here idaho saw moonsilvered ribs of rock showed through the sand then the dunes began i should not have left him alone not even for a minute idaho thought i knew what was in his mind he told me the future no longer needed his physical presence tandis had reported when he left me he called back now i am free were his words damn them idaho thought the fremen had refused to send thopters or searchers of any kind rescue was against their ancient customs there will be a worm for muaddib they said and they began the chant for those committed to the desert the ones whose water went to shaihulud mother of sand father of time beginning of life grant him passage idaho seated himself on a flat rock and stared at the desert the night out there was filled with camouflage patterns there was no way to tell where paul had gone now i am free idaho spoke the words aloud surprised by the sound of his own voice for a time he let his mind run remembering a day when hed taken the child paul to the sea market on caladan the dazzling glare of a sun on water the seas riches brought up dead there to be sold idaho remembered gurney halleck playing music of the baliset for them pleasure laughter rhythms pranced in his awareness leading his mind like a thrall down channels of remembered delight gurney halleck gurney would blame him for this tragedy memory music faded he recalled pauls words there are problems in this universe for which there are no answers idaho began to wonder how paul would die out there in the desert quickly killed by a worm slowly in the sun some of the fremen back there in the sietch had said muaddib would never die that he had entered the ruhworld where all possible futures existed that he would be present henceforth in the alam almythal wandering there endlessly even after his flesh had ceased to be hell die and im powerless to prevent it idaho thought he began to realize that there might be a certain fastidious courtesy in dying without a trace no remains nothing and an entire planet for a tomb mentat solve thyself he thought words intruded on his memory the ritual words of the fedaykin lieutenant posting a guard over muaddibs children it shall be the solemn duty of the officer in charge the plodding selfimportant language of government enraged him it had seduced the fremen it had seduced everyone a man a great man was dying out there but language plodded on and on and on what had happened he wondered to all the clean meanings that screened out nonsense somewhere in some lost where which the imperium had created theyd been walled off sealed against chance rediscovery his mind quested for solutions mentat fashion patterns of knowledge glistened there lorelei hair might shimmer thus beckoning beckoning the enchanted seaman into emerald caverns with an abrupt start idaho drew back from catatonic forgetfulness so he thought rather than face my failure i would disappear within myself the instant of that almostplunge remained in his memory examining it he felt his life stretch out as long as the existence of the universe real flesh lay condensed finite in its emerald cavern of awareness but infinite life had shared his being idaho stood up feeling cleansed by the desert sand was beginning to chatter in the wind pecking at the surfaces of leaves in the orchard behind him there was the dry and abrasive smell of dust in the night air his robe whipped to the pulse of a sudden gust somewhere far out in the bled idaho realized a mother storm raged lifting vortices of winding dust in hissing violence a giant worm of sand powerful enough to cut flesh from bones he will become one with the desert idaho thought the desert will fulfill him it was a zensunni thought washing through his mind like clear water paul would go on marching out there he knew an atreides would not give himself up completely to destiny not even in the full awareness of the inevitable a touch of prescience came over idaho then and he saw that people of the future would speak of paul in terms of seas despite a life soaked in dust water would follow him his flesh foundered they would say but he swam on behind idaho a man cleared his throat idaho turned to discern the figure of stilgar standing on the bridge over the qanat he will not be found stilgar said yet all men will find him the desert takes him and deifies him idaho said yet he was an interloper here he brought an alien chemistry to this planet water the desert imposes its own rhythms stilgar said we welcomed him called him our mahdi our muaddib and gave him his secret name base of the pillar usul still he was not born a fremen and that does not change the fact that we claimed him and have claimed him finally stilgar put a hand on idahos shoulder all men are interlopers old friend youre a deep one arent you stil deep enough i can see how we clutter the universe with our migrations muaddib gave us something uncluttered men will remember his jihad for that at least he wont give up to the desert idaho said hes blind but he wont give up hes a man of honor and principle he was atreidestrained and his water will be poured on the sand stilgar said come he pulled gently at idahos arm alia is back and is asking for you she was with you at sietch makab yes she helped whip those soft naibs into line they take her orders now as i do what orders she commanded the execution of the traitors oh idaho suppressed a feeling of vertigo as he looked up at the promontory which traitors the guildsman the reverend mother mohiam korba a few others you slew a reverend mother i did muaddib left word that it should not be done he shrugged but i disobeyed him as alia knew i would idaho stared again into the desert feeling himself become whole one person capable of seeing the pattern of what paul had created judgment strategy the atreides called it in their training manuals people are subordinate to government but the ruled influence the rulers did the ruled have any concept he wondered of what they had helped create here alia stilgar said clearing his throat he sounded embarrassed she needs the comfort of your presence and she is the government idaho murmured a regency no more fortune passes everywhere as her father often said idaho muttered we make our bargain with the future stilgar said will you come now we need you back there again he sounded embarrassed she is distraught she cries out against her brother one moment mourns him the next presently idaho promised he heard stilgar leave he stood facing into the rising wind letting the grains of sand rattle against the stillsuit mentat awareness projected the outflowing patterns into the future the possibilities dazzled him paul had set in motion a whirling vortex and nothing could stand in its path the bene tleilax and the guild had overplayed their hands and had lost were discredited the qizarate was shaken by the treason of korba and others high within it and pauls final voluntary act his ultimate acceptance of their customs had ensured the loyalty of the fremen to him and to his house he was one of them forever now paul is gone alias voice was choked she had come up almost silently to where idaho stood and was now beside him he was a fool duncan dont say that he snapped the whole universe will say it before im through she said why for the love of heaven for the love of my brother not of heaven zensunni insight dilated his awareness he could sense that there was no vision in her had been none since chanis death you practice an odd love he said love duncan he had but to step off the track what matter that the rest of the universe would have come shattering down behind him hed have been safe and chani with him then why didnt he for the love of heaven she whispered then more loudly she said pauls entire life was a struggle to escape his jihad and its deification at least hes free of it he chose this ah yes the oracle idaho shook his head in wonder even chanis death his moon fell he was a fool wasnt he duncan idahos throat tightened with suppressed grief such a fool alia gasped her control breaking hell live forever while we must die alia dont its just grief she said voice low just grief do you know what i must do for him i must save the life of the princess irulan that one you should hear her grief wailing giving moisture to the dead she swears she loved him and knew it not she reviles her sisterhood says shell spend her life teaching pauls children you trust her she reeks of trustworthiness ahhh idaho murmured the final pattern unreeled before his awareness like a design on fabric the defection of the princess irulan was the last step it left the bene gesserit with no remaining lever against the atreides heirs alia began to sob leaned against him face pressed into his chest ohhh duncan duncan hes gone idaho put his lips against her hair please he whispered he felt her grief mingling with his like two streams entering the same pool i need you duncan she sobbed love me i do he whispered she lifted her head peered at the moonfrosted outline of his face i know duncan love knows love her words sent a shudder through him a feeling of estrangement from his old self he had come out here looking for one thing and had found another it was as though hed lurched into a room full of familiar people only to realize too late that he knew none of them she pushed away from him took his hand will you come with me duncan wherever you lead he said she led him back across the qanat into the darkness at the base of the massif and its place of safety epilogue no bitter stench of funeralstill for muaddib no knell nor solemn rite to free the mind from avaricious shadows he is the fool saint the golden stranger living forever on the edge of reason let your guard fall and he is there his crimson peace and sovereign pallor strike into our universe on prophetic webs to the verge of a quiet glance there out of bristling starjungles mysterious lethal an oracle without eyes catspaw of prophecy whose voice never dies shaihulud he awaits thee upon a strand where couples walk and fix eye to eye the delicious ennui of love he strides through the long cavern of time scattering the foolself of his dream the gholas hymn
