the chronicles of prydain book three the castle of llyr lloyd alexander authors note in this chronicle of prydain following the book of three and the black cauldron what befalls the heroine is as important and perilous as the heros own quest princess eilonwy of the redgold hair does much more than face the unavoidable and in her view absolutely unnecessary ordeal of becoming a young lady as dallben the old enchanter warns for each of us comes a time when we must be more than what we are and this holds true for princesses as well as assistant pigkeepers the castle of llyr is in a sense more romantic than the preceding chronicles taran is noticeably aware of his feelings toward eilonwy and it is sometimes more comic for example the utter despair of the companions in trying to cope with the wellmeaning but hapless prince rhun the mood perhaps is bittersweet rather than grandly heroic but the adventure should hold something beyond the fairytale elements of a magic golden bauble a vengeful queen a mysterious castle and rivals for the hand of a princess the nature of fantasy allows happenings which reveal most clearly our own frailties and our own strengths the inhabitants of prydain are fantasy figures i hope they are also very human prydain itself however is entirely imaginary mona background for the castle of llyr is the ancient welsh name of the island of anglesey but this background is not drawn with a mapmakers accuracy my hope instead is to create the feeling not the fact of the land of wales and its legends some readers may indignantly question the fate of several villains in this tale especially that of one of the most reprehensible scoundrels in prydain i should point out that while the castle of llyr like the previous books can stand as a chronicle in its own right certain events in it have farreaching consequences beyond that i will hint no further but only recommend one of the more difficult virtues patience la chapter prince rhun eilonwy of the redgold hair the princess eilonwy daughter of angharad daughter of regat of the royal house of llyr was leaving caer dallben dallben himself had so ordered it and though tarans heart was suddenly and strangely heavy he knew there was no gainsaying the old enchanters words on the spring morning set for eilonwys departure taran saddled the horses and led them from the stable the princess looking desperately cheerful had wrapped her few belongings in a small bundle slung from her shoulder at her neck hung a fine chain and crescent moon of silver on her finger she wore a ring of ancient craftsmanship and in the fold of her cloak she carried another of her most prized possessions the golden sphere that shone at her command with a light brighter than a flaming torch dallben whose face was more careworn than usual and whose back was bowed as though under a heavy burden embraced the girl at the cottage door you shall always have a place in caer dallben he said and a larger one in my heart but alas raising a young lady is a mystery beyond even an enchanters skill i have had he added with a quick smile difficulties enough raising an assistant pigkeeper i wish you a fair voyage to the isle of mona dallben went on king rhuddlum and queen teleria are kindly and gracious they are eager to stand in your familys stead and serve as your protectors and from queen teleria you shall learn how a princess should behave what cried eilonwy i dont care about being a princess and since im already a young lady how else could i behave thats like asking a fish to learn how to swim hem dallben said wryly i have never seen a fish with skinned knees torn robe and unshod feet they would ill become him as they ill become you he set a gnarled hand gently on eilonwys shoulder child child do you not see for each of us comes a time when we must be more than what we are he turned now to taran watch over her carefully he said i have certain misgivings about letting you and gurgi go with her but if it will ease your parting so be it the princess eilonwy shall go safely to mona taran answered and you said dallben return safely my heart will not be at ease until you do he embraced the girl again and went quickly into the cottage it had been decided that coll would accompany them to great avren harbor and lead back the horses the stout old warrior already mounted waited patiently shaggyhaired gurgi astride his pony looked as mournful as an owl with a stomach ache kaw the tame crow perched in unwonted silence on t arans saddle taran helped eilonwy mount lluagor her favorite steed then swung to the back of melynlas his silvermaned stallion leaving caer dallben behind the little band set out across the soft hills toward avren side by side taran and coll rode ahead of the others to lead the way kaw meanwhile having made himself comfortable on tarans shoulder she never stopped talking for a moment taran said gloomily now at least it will be quieter in caer dallben that it will said coll and less to worry about she was always getting into one scrape or another that too said coll its for the best taran said eilonwy is after all a princess of llyr its not as if she were only an assistant pigkeeper very true said coll looking off toward the pale hills they jogged along silently for a while i shall miss her taran burst out at last half angrily the old warrior grinned and rubbed his shining bald head did you tell her that not not exactly faltered taran i suppose i should have but every time i began talking about it i i felt very odd besides you never know what silly remark shell come out with when youre trying to be serious it may be replied coll smiling we know least what we treasure most but we will have more than enough to keep us busy when you come back and you will learn my boy there is nothing like work to put the heart at rest taran nodded sadly i suppose so he said past midday they turned their horses to the west where the hills began a long slope downward into the avren valley at the last ridge kaw hopped from tarans shoulder and flapped aloft croaking with excitement taran urged melynlas over the rise below the great river swung into view wider here than he had ever seen it sunlight flecked the water in the sheltered curve of the harbor a long slender craft bobbed at the shore taran could make out figures aboard hauling on ropes to raise a square white sail eilonwy and gurgi had also ridden forward tarans heart leaped and to all the companions the sight of the harbor and the waiting vessel was like a sea wind driving sorrow before it eilonwy began chattering gaily and gurgi waved his arms so wildly he nearly tumbled from the saddle yes oh yes he cried bold valiant gurgi is glad to follow kindly master and noble princess with boatings and floatings they cantered down the slope and dismounted at the waters edge seeing them the sailors ran a plank out from the vessel to the shore no sooner had they done so than a young man clambered onto the plank and hastened with eager strides toward the companions but he had taken only a few paces along the swaying board when he lost his footing stumbled and with a loud splash pitched headlong into the shallows taran and coll ran to help him but the young man had already picked himself up and was awkwardly sloshing his way ashore he was of tarans age with a moonround face pale blue eyes and strawcolored hair he wore a sword and a small richly ornamented dagger in a belt of silver links his cloak and jacket worked with threads of gold and silver were now sopping wet the stranger however appeared not the least dismayed either by his ducking or the sodden state of his garments instead he grinned as cheerfully as if nothing whatever had befallen him hullo hullo he called waving a dripping hand is that princess eilonwy i see of course it must be without further ado and without stopping even to wring out his cloak he bowed so low that taran feared the young man would lose his balance then he straightened up and in a solemn voice declared on behalf of rhuddlum son of rhudd and teleria daughter of tannwen king and queen of the isle of mona greetings to the princess eilonwy of the royal house of llyr and to well to all the rest of you he added blinking rapidly as a thought suddenly occurred to him i should have asked your names before i started taran taken aback and not a little vexed by this scatterbrained behavior stepped forward and presented the companions before he could ask the strangers name the young man interrupted splendid you must all introduce yourselves again later one at a time otherwise i might forget oh i see the shipmasters waving at us something to do with tides no doubt hes always very concerned with them this is the first time ive commanded a voyage he went on proudly amazing how easy it is all you need to do is tell the sailors but who are you taran asked puzzled the young man blinked at him did i forget to mention that im prince rhun prince rhun taran repeated in a tone of disbelief quite so answered rhun smiling pleasantly king rhuddlums my father and of course queen telerias my mother shall we go aboard i should hate to upset the shipmaster for he does worry about those tides coll embraced eilonwy when we see you again he told her i doubt we shall recognize you you shall be a fine princess i want to be recognized eilonwy cried i want to be me never fear said coll winking he turned to taran and you my boy farewell when you return send kaw ahead to tell me and i shall meet you at avren harbor prince rhun offering his arm to eilonwy led her across the plank gurgi and taran followed them having formed his own opinion of rhuns agility taran kept a wary eye on the prince until eilonwy was safe aboard the ship was surprisingly roomy and wellfitted the deck was long with benches for oarsmen on either side at the stern rose a high square shed topped by a platform the sailors dipped their oars and worked the vessel to the middle of the river coll trotted along the bank and waved with all his might the old warrior dropped from sight as the ship swung around a bend in the everwidening fiver kaw had flapped to the masthead and as the breeze whistled through his feathers he beat his wings so pridefully that he looked more like a black rooster than a crow the shore turned gray in the distance and the craft sped seaward if rhun had perplexed and vaguely irritated him at their first meeting taran now began to wish he had never laid eyes on the prince taran had meant to speak with eilonwy apart for there was much in his heart he longed to tell her yet each time he ventured to do so prince rhun would pop up as if from nowhere his round face beaming happily calling out hullo hullo a greeting taran found more infuriating each time he heard it once the prince of mona eagerly dashed upto show the companions a large fish he had caught to the delight of eilonwy and gurgi but not taran for a moment later rhuns attention turned elsewhere and he hurried off leaving taran holding the wet slippery fish in his arms another time while leaning over the side to point out a school of dolphins the prince nearly dropped his sword into the sea luckily taran caught it before the blade was lost forever after the ship reached open water prince rhun decided to take a hand at steering but he no sooner grasped the tiller than it flew out of his fingers while rhun clutched at the wooden handle the vessel lurched and slewed about so violently that taran was flung against the bulwark a water cask broke loose and went rolling down the deck the sail flapped madly at the sudden change of course and one bank of oars nearly snapped before the steersman regained the tiller from the undismayed prince the painful bump on tarans head did nothing to raise his esteem of prince rhuns seamanship although the prince made no further attempt to steer the vessel he climbed atop the platform where he called out orders to the crew lash up the sail rhun shouted happily steady the helm no seaman himself taran nevertheless realized the sail was already tightly lashed and the craft was moving unwaveringly through the water and he very shortly became aware that the sailors were quietly going about their task of keeping the ship on course without paying any heed whatever to the prince tarans head ached from the bump his jacket was still unpleasantly damp and fishy and when at last his chance came to speak with eilonwy he was altogether out of sorts prince of mona indeed he muttered hes no more than a a princeling a clumsy muddleheaded baby commanding the voyage if the sailors listened to him wed be aground in no time ive never sailed a ship but ive no doubt i could do it better than he ive never seen anyone so feckless feckless answered eilonwy he does often seem a little dense but im sure he means well and ive a feeling he has a good heart in fact i think hes rather nice i suppose you do taran replied all the more nettled by eilonwys words because he gave you his arm to lean on a gallant princely gesture lucky he didnt pitch you over the side it was polite at least eilonwy remarked which is something assistant pigkeepers sometimes arent an assistant pigkeeper taran snapped yes thats to be my lot in life i was born to be one just as the princeling of mona was born to his rank hes a kings son and i i dont even know the names of my parents well said eilonwy you cant blame rhun for being born i mean you could but it wouldnt help matters its like kicking a rock with your bare foot taran snorted i daresay thats his fathers sword hes got on and i daresay hes never drawn it except to frighten a rabbit at least ive earned the right to wear mine yet he still calls himself a prince does his birth make him worthy of his rank as worthy as gwydion son of don prince gwydions the greatest warrior in prydain eilonwy replied you cant expect everyone to be like him and it seems to me that if an assistant pigkeeper does the best he can and prince does the best he can theres no difference between them no difference taran cried angrily you spoke well enough of rhun taran of caer dallben eilonwy declared i really believe youre jealous and sorry for yourself and thats as ridiculous as as painting your nose green taran said no more but turned away and stared glumly at the water to make matters worse the wind freshened the sea heaved about the sides of the ship and taran could barely keep his footing his head spun and he feared the vessel would capsize eilonwy deathly pale clung to the bulwark gurgi wailed and howled pitifully poor tender head is full of whirlings and twirlings gurgi does not like this ship any more he wants to be at home prince rhun appeared not the least distressed he ate heartily and was in the best of spirits while taran huddled wretchedly in his cloak the sea did not calm until dusk and at nightfall taran was grateful the vessel anchored in a calm cove eilonwy took out the golden sphere in her hands it began to glow and its rays shimmered over the black water i say whats that cried prince rhun who had clambered down from his platform its my bauble said eilonwy i always carry it with me you never can tell when it will come in handy amazing exclaimed the prince ive never seen anything like it in my life he examined the golden ball carefully but as he held it in his hand the light winked out rhun looked up in dismay im afraid ive broken it no eilonwy assured him its just that it doesnt work for everyone unbelievable said rhun you must show it to my parents i wish we had a few of those trinkets around the castle after a last curious glance at the bauble rhun returned it to eilonwy insisting that the princess sleep in the comfort of the shed rhun bedded himself down amid a pile of netting gurgi curled up nearby while kaw heedless of tarans entreaties to leave his high perch roosted on the mast rhun falling asleep instantly snored so piercingly that taran already vexed beyond endurance stretched out on the deck as far as possible from the slumbering prince when taran slept at last he dreamed the companions had never left caer dallben chapter dinas rhydnant the days that followed put taran in better spirits the companions grew used to the motion of the ship the air was clear sharp and saltladen and taran could taste the briny spray on his lips while prince rhun from atop his platform shouted commands which the crew as usual did not heed the companions were glad to pass the time by lending a hand at the tasks aboard the work as coll had foretold eased tarans heart yet there came moments when he suddenly recalled the purpose of the voyage and wished it would never end he had just finished coiling a length of rope when kaw swooped down from the mast and circled around him croaking wildly an instant later the lookout cried they had sighted land at prince rhuns urging the companions hastened to climb to the platform in the bright morning taran saw the hills of mona spring from the horizon the vessel sped closer to the crescentshaped harbor of dinas rhydnant with its piers and jetties its stone sea wall and clusters of ships steep cliffs rose almost from the waters edge and on the highest of them stood a tall castle from it the banners of the house of rhuddlum snapped in the breeze the vessel glided to the pier the sailors cast the mooring lines and leaped ashore the companions with prince rhun marching in the lead were escorted to the castle by ranks of warriors who made a hedge of honor with their spears yet even this short journey did not end without mishap the prince of mona drawing his sword to return the salute of the captain of guards did so with such a sweeping gesture that the point snagged in tarans cloak i say im sorry about that cried rhun curiously examining the long gaping slash his blade had caused and i too prince of mona taran muttered vexed at rhun and embarrassed at the impression his torn garment would make on the king and queen he said no more but shut his lips and desperately hoped the damage would go unnoticed the procession passed through the castle gates and into a wide courtyard shouting a glad hullo hullo prince rhun hurried to his waiting parents king rhuddlum had the same round and cheerful face as prince rhun he greeted the companions cordially repeating himself a number of times if he was aware of tarans torn cloak he showed no sign which only added to tarans distress when king rhuddlum at last finished talking queen teleria stepped forward the queen was a stout pleasantlooking woman dressed in fluttering white garments a golden circlet crowned her braided hair which was the same straw color as prince rhuns she showered eilonwy with kisses embraced the still embarrassed taran halted in amazement when she came to gurgi but embraced him nevertheless welcome daughter of angharad queen teleria began returning to eilonwy your presence honors dont fidget child and stand straight our royal house the queen stopped suddenly and took eilonwy by the shoulders good llyr she cried where did you get those frightful clothes yes i can see its high time dallben let you out of that holeandcorner in the middle of the woods holeandcorner indeed eilorlwy cried i love caer dallben and dallben is a great enchanter exactly said queen teleria hes so busy casting spells and all such that hes let you grow like a weed she turned to king rhuddlum wouldnt you say so my dear very much like a weed agreed the king eying kaw with interest the crow hunched up his wings opened his beak and loudly croaked rhuddlum to the kings immense delight queen teleria meanwhile had been examining taran and gurgi by turns look at that disgracefully torn cloak you must both have new raiment she declared new jackets new sandals everything luckily we have a perfectly wonderful shoemaker at the castle now he was just dont pout that way my child youll give yourself a blister passing through but weve kept him busy and hes still cobbling away our chief steward shall see to it magg she called magg where is he at your command answered the chief steward who had been standing all the while by queen telerias elbow he wore one of the finest cloaks taran had ever seen its rich embroidery almost surpassing king rhuddlums garment magg carried a long staff of polished wood taller than himself from his neck hung a chain of heavy silver links and at his belt was a huge iron ring from which jingled keys of all sizes all has been ordered said magg bowing deeply your decision has been foreseen the shoemaker the tailors and weavers stand ready excellent queen teleria cried now the princess and i shall go first to the weaving rooms and magg shall show the rest of you to your chambers magg bowed again even more deeply and beckoned with his staff with gurgi at his heels taran followed the chief steward through the courtyard into a high stone building and down a vaulted corridor at the end of it magg gestured toward an open portal and silently withdrew taran stepped inside the chamber was small but neat and airy bright with sunlight from a narrow casement fragrant rushes covered the floor and in one corner stood a low couch and pallet of straw taran had no sooner taken off his cloak when the portal suddenly burst open and a spiky yellow head thrust in fflewddur fflam taran shouted with joyful surprise at the sight of this longabsent companion well met the bard seized taran by the hand and began pumping it with all his might at the same time clapping him resoundingly on the shoulder kaw flapped his wings while gurgi leaped into the air yelped at the top of his voice and embraced fflewddur in a shower of twigs leaves and shedding hair well well well said the bard and high time it is ive been waiting for you i thought youd never get here how did you come cried taran who had just begun to catch his breath how did you know we were to be at dinas rhydnant why i couldnt help knowing the bard replied beaming with delight theres been talk of nothing but the princess eilonwy where is she by the way i must find her and pay my respects at once i was hoping dallben would send you along with her how is he how is coll i see youve brought kaw great belin ive seen none of you for so long ive lost track but fflewddur taran interrupted what brings you to mona of all places well its a short tale said the bard i had decided this time really to make a go of being a king and so i did for the best part of a year then along came spring and the barding and wandering season and everything indoors began looking unspeakably dreary and everything outdoors began somehow pulling at me and next thing i knew i was on my way id never been to mona so that was the best reason in the world for going i reached dinas rhydnant a week ago the vessel had already left to meet you or you can be sure id have been on it and you can be sure youd have borne us better company than the princeling of mona taran said we were lucky that noble fool didnt somehow manage to blunder onto a reef and sink us in the tide but what of doli he went on i have longed to see him as much as i have longed to see you good old doli the bard chuckled shaking his yellow head i tried to rouse him when i first set out but hes hidden himself away with his kinsmen in the realm of the fair folk fflewddur sighed i fear our good dwarf has lost his taste for adventure i managed to get word to him thinking he might come along with me for the sport of it he sent back a message all it said was humph you should have come to meet us at the harbor taran said it would have cheered me to know you were here ah yes i was going to replied fflewddur with some hesitation but i thought id wait and surprise you i was busy too getting ready a song about the arrival of the princess quite an impressive chant if i do say so myself were all mentioned in it with plenty of heroic deeds and gurgi too cried gurgi of course said the bard i shall sing it for all of you this evening gurgi shouted and clapped his hands gurgi can not wait to hear hummings and strummings you shall hear them old friend the bard assured him all in due course but you can imagine i could hardly spare the time to join the welcoming procession at this a harp string broke suddenly fflewddur unslung his beloved instrument and looked at it ruefully there it goes again he sighed these beastly strings will never leave off snapping whenever i ah add a little to the truth and in this case the truth of the matter is i wasnt invited but a bard of the harp is honored at every court in prydain taran said how could they overlook fflewddur raised a hand true true he said i was certainly honored here and handsomely too that was before they learned i wasnt a real bard afterward he admitted i was moved into the stables you should have told them you are a king said taran no no said fflewddur shaking his head when im a bard im a bard and when im a king thats something else again i never mix the two king rhuddlum and queen teleria are decent sorts fflewddur continued the chief steward was the one who had me turned out are you sure there wasnt some mistake taran asked from what ive seen of him he seems to do his duties perfectly all too well if you ask me said fflewddur somehow he found out about my qualifications and next thing i knew into the stables the truth of it is i think he hates music surprising how many people ive run into who for some reason or other simply cant abide harpplaying taran heard a loud rapping at the portal it was magg himself come with the shoemaker who stood humbly behind him not that he troubles me fflewddur whispered that is he added looking at the harp not beyond what i can honorably bear he slung the instrument over his shoulder yes well as i was saying i must go and find princess eilonwy we shall meet later in the stables if you dont mind and i shall play my new song glaring at magg fflewddur strode from the chamber the chief steward taking no notice of the bards angry glance bowed to taran as queen teleria commanded you and your companion are to be given new apparel the shoemaker will serve you as you wish taran sat down on a wooden stool and as magg departed from the chamber the shoemaker drew near the man was bent with age and garbed most shabbily a grimy cloth was wrapped around his head and a fringe of gray hair fell almost to his shoulders at his broad belt hung curiously shaped knives awls and hanks of thongs kneeling before taran he opened a great sack and thrust in his hand to pull out strips of leather which he placed about him on the floor he squinted at his findings holding up one after the other then casting it aside we must use the best the best he croaked in a voice much like kaws only that will do to go wellshod is half the journey he chuckled is that not so eh is that not so taran of caer dallben taran drew back with a start the shoemakers tone had suddenly rung differently he stared down at the aged man who had picked up a piece of leather and was now shaping it deftly with a crooked little knife the shoemaker his face as tanned as his own materials was watching him steadily gurgi looked ready to yelp loudly the man raised a finger to his lips taran in confusion hurriedly knelt before the shoemaker lord gwydion gwydions eyes flashed with pleasure but his smile was grim hear me well he said quickly in a hushed voice should we be interrupted i shall find a way to speak with you later tell no one who i am what you must know above all is this the life of the princess eilonwy is in danger and so he added is your own chapter the shoemaker taran paled his head still whirled at seeing the prince of don in the guise of a shoemaker and gwydions words left him all the more confused our lives in danger he asked hurriedly does arawn of annuvin seek us as far as dinas rhydnant gwydion motioned for gurgi to stand guard at the portal and turned once more to taran no said gwydion with a quick shake of his head though arawns wrath has grown to fury since the black cauldron was destroyed the threat comes not from annuvin taran frowned who then there is none in dinas rhydnant who wishes us ill you can not mean that king rhuddlum or queen teleria the house of rhuddlum has always borne friendship to the sons of don and to our high king math replied gwydion look elsewhere taran of caer dallben but who would harm eilonwy taran asked urgently it is known she is under dallbens protection there is one who would dare to stand against dallben gwydion said one against whom my own powers may not suffice and whom i fear as much as arawn himself gwydions face was taut and his green eyes flickered with deep anger as he spoke one harsh word achren tarans heart chilled no he whispered no that evil enchantress is dead so i too believed gwydion answered it is not true achren lives she has not rebuilt spiral castle taran cried his thoughts flashing to the dungeon where achren had held him prisoner spiral castle still lies in ruins as you left it gwydion said and grass already covers it oethanoeth where achren would have given me to death no longer stands i have journeyed to those places and seen with my own eyes you must know that i have long pondered her fate gwydion went on of achren there has not been the slightest sign as though the earth had swallowed her this troubled me and lay heavily on my heart and i have never given up seeking traces of her at last i found these traces said gwydion they were faint as words whispered in the wind puzzling rumors that seemed at first no more than imaginings a senseless riddle without an answer perhaps gwydion continued i should say an answer without a riddle and it was only after long toil and hard journeying that i discovered part of that riddle alas only a part gwydions voice lowered as he spoke his hands did not cease carving and shaping the unfinished sandal what i have learned is this after spiral castle fell achren vanished at first i believed she had sought refuge in the realm of annuvin for she had lived long as a consort of arawn indeed it was achren who gave arawn his power in the days when she herself ruled prydain but she did not go to annuvin since she had let the sword dyrnwyn slip from her hands and failed to take my life it may be that she feared arawns wrath perhaps she dared not face him having been outwitted by a young girl and an assistant pigkeeper of this i am not certain nevertheless she fled prydain since then no man knows what has befallen her yet even to know she is alive is cause enough for fear do you think she is on mona taran asked does she seek vengeance on us but eilonwy was no more than a child when she escaped from achren she understood nothing of what she did wittingly or not by taking dyrnwyn from spiral castle eilonwy gave achren her most grievous defeat gwydion said achren does not forget or forgive he knit his brows it is my fear that she seeks eilonwy not only for revenge i sense there is something other than that it is hidden from me now yet i must discover it without delay more than eilonwys life may hang in the balance if only dallben had let her stay with us taran said in dismay he too must have known achren was alive did he not realize eilonwy would be in danger the moment she was beyond his protection dallbens ways are deep said gwydion and not always given to me to fathom he knows much but he foresenses more than he chooses to tell gwydion putting down his awl drew out a leather thong and began stitching it through the sandal dallben sent me word that the princess eilonwy would voyage to mona and counseled me to turn my attention here he told me too of certain other matters but it is better not to speak of them now i can not sit idle while eilonwy may be in peril taran insisted is there no way i can serve you you shall serve me best by keeping silent gwydion answered stay watchful say nothing of me or of what we have spoken not to the princess eilonwy not even to fflewddur he smiled our eager bard saw me in the stables and luckily did not know me meantime i shall before the prince of don could finish gurgi began waving his arms in warning footsteps rang in the corridor and gwydion bent quickly to the task of fitting the sandals hullo hullo cried prince rhun striding into the chamber ah shoemaker there you are have you done with your work i say they are handsome arent they he said glancing at the sandals amazingly wellmade i should like a pair myself oh my mother asks to see you in the great hall he added turning to taran gwydions face had fallen suddenly into lines and wrinkles his shoulders were hunched and his voice shook with age without a further glance at taran gwydion beckoned to rhun come with me young prince he said you shall have sandals befitting your station as kaw fluttered after him taran hurried from the chamber and down the corridor gurgi roundeyed with fright trotted beside him oh fearsome danger gurgi moaned gurgi is sorry great enchanter sends us to place of peril gurgi wants to hide his poor tender head under kindly straw at caer dallben taran warned him to silence eilonwy is surely in more danger than we are he whispered hastening toward the great hall i dont like the thought of achren turning up again any more than you do but gwydion is here to protect eilonwy and so are we yes yes cried gurgi brave loyal gurgi will guard goldenhaired princess too oh yes and she will be safe with him but he snuffled he still longs to be in caer dallben take heart my friend taran said he smiled and put a hand on gurgis trembling shoulder we companions shall see no ill befalls any of us but remember not a word that gwydion is here he has his own plans and we must do nothing to betray them gurgi will be silent gurgi cried clapping his hands to his mouth oh yes but mind he added shaking a finger at kaw that gossipy black bird does not tell with talkings and squawkings silence kaw croaked bobbing his head secrets in the highceilinged great hall with its flagstones that seemed to cover a space as large as the orchard at caer dallben taran caught sight of eilonwy amid a group of court ladies some of eilonwys age were listening delightedly to the princess the rest all of whom looked much like queen teieria were frowning or whispering behind their hands magg standing near the queens throne watched impassively and there we stood eilonwy was saying her eyes flashing back to back sword in hand the huntsmen of annuvin burst from the forest they were upon us in a moment the young girlsof the court gasped with excitement while some of the older women gave horrified cluckings that reminded taran of nothing so much as colls chicken run taran saw that eilonwy wore a new cloak her hair had been combed and dressed in a different fashion among the ladies she shone like a bird of golden plumage and with a curious twinge of heart taran realized that had it not been for her chattering he might not have known her good llyr cried queen teleria who had leaped from her throne as eilonwy continued the tale of battle im beginning to think you havent had a my dear child dont be so gleeful when you talk about hacking at people with swords safe moment in your life she blinked shook her head and fanned herself with a kerchief what a relief that dallben has finally decided to be sensible and send you to us if nothing else youll be out of harms way taran caught his breath and it took all his strength to force himself not to shout gwydions warning aloud ah there you are queen teleria called spying taran i had thought to speak to you about thats right young man step up briskly bow a little more deeply if you can and good llyr dont scowl so the royal feast tonight you shall be pleased to know that in honor of all of you were planning to invite a perfectly wonderful bard who claims to be a bard that is and who claims by the way to know you the selfstyled bard said magg with illconcealed distaste at the mention of fflewddur has already been commanded to present himself at the feast therefore in the matter of new garments teleria went on you had better go with magg immediately and find some that has been seen to as well lady teleria murmured the chief steward handing taran a neatly folded cloak and jacket wonderful teleria cried all that remains to be done is well i do believe everything has been done i suggest then taran of caer dallben that you go and make yourself dont frown so youll look old before your time ready taran hardly had finished bowing to queen teleria when eilonwy seized him and gurgi by the arms and hastily drew them away youve seen fflewddur of course she whispered now its getting to be more like old times what a blessing to have him here ive never met such silly women why i dont think theres one of them thats ever drawn a sword all they want to talk about is sewing and embroidery and weaving and how to run a castle the ones who have husbands are always complaining about them and the ones who havent are always complaining about the lack of them theyve never been out of dinas rhydnant in their lives i told them a thing or two about some of our adventures not the best ones im saving those for later when you can be there to tell your part in them what well do eilonwy hurried on her eyes sparkling after the feast when no ones watching well get hold of fflewddur and go exploring for a few days theyll never miss us theres so many people coming and going around here theres bound to be a few adventures on mona but we certainly wont find them in this stupid castle now first thing you must look out a sword for me i wish id brought one from caer dallben not that i think well need swords but its better to have them just in case gurgi of course shall bring along his wallet of food eilonwy taran interrupted this can not be hows that asked eilonwy oh very well you neednt bother with swords then well just go adventuring as we are she hesitated whats the matter with you i must say you have the strangest expressions on your face from time to time right now you look as if a mountain were about to fall on your head as i was saying eilonwy taran said firmly you are not to leave dinas rhydnant eilonwy so surprised she stopped talking for a moment stared at him openmouthed what she cried what did you say not leave the castle taran of caer dallben i think the salt air must have pickled your wits listen to me taran said gravely searching his mind for some means to warn the startled girl without revealing gwydions secret dinas rhydnant is unfamiliar to us we know nothing of mona there may be dangers that we dangers cried eilonwy you can be sure of that and the biggest is that ill be bored to tears dont think for an instant i mean to wear out my days in this castle you of all people tell me im not to go adventuring what really is the matter with you im ready to believe you dropped your courage over the side of rhuns ship along with the anchor stone it is not a question of courage taran began it is the better part of wisdom to now youre talking about wisdom eilonwy cried before that was the last thing in the world you thought about this is different taran said can you not understand he pleaded though he saw dearly from eilonwys face that his words made no sense to her for an instant he was tempted to blurt out the tiuth instead he took the girl by the shoulders you are not to set foot outside this place he ordered angrily and if i think you have any idea of doing so i shall ask king rhuddlum to set a guard over you what cried eilonwy how dare you tears suddenly filled her eyes yes i do understand youre glad ive been sent to this wretched island and these clucking hens you couldnt wait for a chance to be rid of me you actually want me to stay here and be lost in this dreadful castle thats worse than putting someones head in a sack of feathers sobbing eilonwy stamped her foot taran of caer dallben im not speaking to you any more chapter shadows the feast that evening was surely the merriest the castle had ever seen kaw perched on the back of tarans chair bobbed up and down and looked as if the banquet had been arranged entirely in his honor king rhuddlum beamed with good spirits the talk and laughter of the guests rang through the great hall behind the long table crowded with queen telerias ladies of the court magg flitted back and forth snapping his fingers and whispering commands to servitors bearing endless dishes of food and flagons of drink for taran it was a waking nightmare he sat silent and uneasy his repast untouched you neednt look so gloomy said eilonwy after all you arent the one who has to stay here if im trying to make the best of things i must say youre not exactly helpful i want to remind you im still not speaking to you after the way you behaved today without waiting to hear tarans confused protests eilonwy tossed her head and began chattering to prince rhun taran bit his lip he felt as though he were shouting a voiceless warning while eilonwy all unwitting raced gaily toward the brink of a cliff at the end of the feasting fflewddur tuned his harp stepped to the middle of the hall and sang his new lay taran listened without pleasure although he realized it was the best fflewddur had yet composed when the bard had done and king rhuddlum had begun to yawn the guests rose from their seats at the table taran plucked fflewddurs sleeve and drew him aside ive been thinking about the stables taran said anxiously no matter what magg says its not a fitting place for you to sleep ill speak to king rhuddlum and im sure hell order magg to give you back your chamber in the castle taran hesitated i i think somehow it would be better if we were all together we are strangers here and know nothing of the ways of this place great belin dont give yourself a moments concern about that replied the bard for my part i prefer the stables indeed thats one reason i go wandering to get away from stuffy dreary castles besides he added behind his hand it would lead to trouble with magg and if he pushes me beyond endurance there will be swordplay a fflam is hotheaded which is hardly courteous behavior from a guest no no we shall all be fine and meet again in the morning so saying fflewddur shouldered his harp waved good night and made his way from the hall something tells me we should keep an eye on the castle taran said to gurgi he put a forefinger under kaws feet and set the bird on gurgis shoulder where the crow immediately began running his beak through gurgis matted hair stay close to eilonwys chamber he went on ill join you soon keep kaw with you and send him to me if anything seems amiss gurgi nodded yes yes he whispered loyal gurgi will stand with watchful waitings he will guard dreamful drowsings of noble princess unnoticed among the departing guests taran walked to the courtyard hoping to find gwydion he strode quickly toward the stables stars filled the clear night sky and a bright moon hung above the crags of mona in the stables taran discovered no trace of the prince of don but came only upon fflewddur curled up in the straw his arm flung around his harp and already snoring peacefully taran turned once more to the castle which had by now fallen into darkness he stood a moment wondering where else he might seek hullo hullo prince rhun burst from around a corner at such a rate he nearly sent taran sprawling still awake are you so am i my mother says its good for me to take a little stroll before sleeping i suppose youre doing the same very good we shall walk along together that we shall not taran retorted now of all times he had no wish to be hindered by the feckless prince i i seek the tailors he added quickly where are they lodged youre looking for tailors rhun asked how odd whatever for my jacket taran hurriedly answered it it fits me badly i must ask them to fix it in the middle of the night asked rhun his moon face puzzled now that really is surprising he pointed toward a shadowed side of the castle their chambers are down there but i shouldnt think theyd be in a humor to stitch well if you rouse them up out of a sleep tailors can be touchy you know i advise you to wait until morning no it must be done now taran said impatient to be rid of rhun the prince shrugged wished him a cheerful good night and trotted off again taran made his way toward a cluster of sheds beyond the stable his search there was also in vain discouraged he had decided to rejoin gurgi when he stopped suddenly a figure was moving quickly across the courtyard not toward the main portal but to the farthest angle of the heavy stone wall could eilonwy have slipped away from gurgi taran was about to call out then fearful of waking the castle he hurried after the figure an instant later it seemed to disappear completely taran pressed on at the wall he stumbled upon a narrow opening barely wide enough to squeeze through taran plunged through the curtain of ivy concealing it and found himself beyond the castle on a rocky slope overlooking the harbor the figure taran suddenly realized was not eilonwy too tall the gait different he caught his breath as the cloaked shape turned once for a furtive glance at the castle and the moonlight glittered for a moment over its features it was magg spiderlike the chief steward was rapidly picking his way down a path in a surge of fear and suspicion taran clambered blindly over jagged stones trying his best to be both swift and silent despite the clear night the way was difficult to follow boulders loomed to catch him unawares and break his stride he longed for the light of eilonwys bauble as he scrambled headlong after magg toward the sleeping harbor magg had come to level ground well ahead of taran and was scuttling along the sea wall until at the far end he reached a huge pile of rocks with surprising agility the chief steward swung himself up crawled over and once more dropped out of sight casting caution aside fearful he would lose track of magg taran broke into a run along the wall moonbright water lapped and whispered a shadow moved for an instant among the stilted piers in alarm taran checked his pace then hastened on his eyes were playing tricks even the rocks themselves seemed to rise before him like crouching threatening beasts gritting his teeth taran climbed the dark barrier of rocks below the water churned in glittering eddies and foamed among the stones the surf rang in his ears as he hauled himself to the crest there he clung not daring to follow farther magg had stopped not many paces beyond at the edge of a narrow spit of land taran saw him kneel and make a rapid motion in another instant a light flared the chief steward had lit a torch and now raised it overhead moving the flickering flame slowly back and forth as taran watched fearful and puzzled a tiny point of orange light glowed far seaward this answering signal taran judged could come only from a ship though he could make out nothing of the vessels shape or distance magg waved the torch again in a different pattern the light from the ship repeated it then winked out magg thrust his torch into the black water where it sputtered and died he turned and strode quickly toward the tumble of rocks where taran lay taran left blinking in the sudden darkness sought to clamber down before magg should come upon him but could find no foothold in panic he groped for a jutting stone below him slipped caught vainly for another one he could hear magg scrabbling up the far side and let himself fall among the rocks wincing at the sharp pain he tried to hide in the shadows maggs head had just appeared at the crest when taran was seized firmly from behind taran snatched at his sword a hand was clapped over his mouth stifling his shout and he was dragged rapidly toward the foaming wavelets to be flung silently down amid the stones make no sound gwydions voice whispered the command taran went limp with relief overhead magg lowered himself from the mass of stones and passed no more than a dozen paces from the two crouching figures gwydion clinging to the rocks above the surf motioned for taran to stay hidden the chief steward without a backward glance hastened once more along the sea wall heading for the castle seize him taran urged a ship rides at anchor i saw him signal it we must make him tell us what he is about gwydion shook his head his green eyes followed the retreating magg and his lips drew tightly against his teeth in the lean smile of a stalking wolf he still wore the rags of the shoemaker but dyrnwyn the black sword now hung at his belt let him go he murmured the game is not played out but the signal taran began gwydion nodded i too saw it i have been keeping watch over the castle since i left you though a moment ago he added with some severity i feared an assistant pigkeeper would stumble into a snare set to catch a traitor would you serve me then return at once to the castle stay close by the princess dare we let magg go unhindered taran asked he must go unhindered for a time at least replied gwydion the shoemaker will soon put down his awl and take up the sword until then keep silent i would not spoil maggs scheme before i learn more of it the fisherfolk of mona have already told a curious and harmless shoemaker part of what he must know gwydion continued enough to be certain of one thing achren is aboard that vessel yes gwydion went on as taran drew a sharp breath this much i suspected achren herself would not dare strike directly against eilonwy the castle is strong and wellguarded only treachery could open its gates achren needed a hand to do her bidding now i know whose it is gwydion frowned deeply as he spoke on but why he murmured almost to himself too much still remains hidden if it is as i fear he shook his head quickly it does not please me to use eilonwy as unwitting bait for a trap but i can not do otherwise magg can be watched taran said but what of achren i must find some means to learn her plan as well as maggs replied gwydion go quickly now he ordered soon all may grow clear so i hope for i would not see the princess eilonwy long in peril taran hastened to obey gwydions command leaving the prince of don at the harbor he made his way with all speed up the winding path to the castle found the opening in the wall and pressed through it into the dark courtyard eilonwy he knew would not be safe so long as magg had the freedom of the castle but magg at least could be watched the terror that chilled tarans heart came from the ship waiting in the night memory of achren beautiful and merciless again returned to him from a day long past he recalled her livid face her voice that had spoken so softly of torment and death it was her shadow that loomed behind the treacherous chief steward he hurried silently across the courtyard a dim light shone from one of the chambers stealthily taran moved toward it raised himself on tiptoe and peered through the casement in the glow of an oil lamp he saw the chief steward magg clutched a long dagger which he brandished in the air all the while making fierce grimaces after a time he hid the weapon in his garments then picked up a small looking glass into which he smiled pursed his lips and eyed himself with glances of deep satisfaction taran watched with rage and horror hardly able to keep from bursting in upon him with a final smirk the chief steward put out the lamp taran clenched his fists turned away and entered the castle at eilonwys chamber he found gurgi crouched on the flagstones rumpled and halfasleep gurgi blinked and sprang to his feet kaw as tousled as gurgi himself popped his head from under his wing all is quiet gurgi whispered yes yes watchful gurgi has not moved from portal valiant sleepy gurgi keeps noble princess from harmful hurtings his poor tender head is heavy but it does not nod oh no you have done well taran said sleep my friend go and rest that poor tender head of yours and i shall stay here until daylight while gurgi yawning and rubbing his eyes crept down the corridor taran took his place before the chamber he sank to the flagstones and with hand on sword rested his head on his knees and fought against his own weariness once or twice despite his efforts he drowsed then started up suddenly the vaulted corridor slowly lightened in the rising dawn with relief taran saw the first rays of morning and at last allowed himself to close his eyes taran of caer dallben he stumbled to his feet and clutched his blade eilonwy looking fresh and wellrested stood in the doorway taran of caer dallben she declared i nearly tripped over you whatever in the world are you doing befuddled taran could only stammer that he found the hallway more comfortable than his chamber eilonwy shook her head that she remarked is the silliest thing ive heard this morning i may hear something sillier because its early yet but i doubt it im beginning to think the ways of assistant pigkeepers are quite beyond me she shrugged in any case im going to breakfast after you wash your face and untangle your hair you might have some too it would do you good you look as jumpy as a frog with fleas without waiting for taran to shake the sleep from his head and before he could stop her eilonwy disappeared down the corridor taran hurried after her even in the bright morning he felt shadows cling to him like black spider webs by now he hoped gwydion had discovered achrens plan but magg still went free taran recalling the chief stewards hidden dagger had no intention of letting eilonwy out of his sight for an instant hullo hullo his round face glowing as if he had just scrubbed it prince rhun popped out of his chamber just as taran passed by going to breakfast cried the prince clapping taran on the shoulder good so am i then we shall meet in the great hall taran hastily replied striving to shake himself loose from rhuns friendly grasp amazing how ones appetite grows during the night prince rhun went on oh by the way did you ever manage to rouse the tailors tailors taran answered impatiently what tailors oh yes yes they have done what i asked he quickly added peering down the corridor splendid cried rhun i wish i had the same good fortune do you know that shoemaker never did finish my sandals hed only just begun then off he went and that was the end of them it may be he had a more important task to do taran replied as do i what could be more important to a shoemaker than making shoes asked rhun however he snapped his fingers ah i knew there was something ive forgotten my cloak hold on i shall only be a moment prince rhun taran cried i must join the princess eilonwy we shall be there directly called rhun from the chamber oh drat there goes my sandal lace broken i do wish that shoemaker had finished his work leaving the prince of mona still rummaging in the chamber taran sped anxiously to the great hall king rhuddlum and queen teleria were already at table the queen surrounded as always by her ladies taran looked quickly about him magg usually in attendance was not there nor was there any sign of eilonwy chapter the oath where is eilonwy taran cried as king rhuddlum and queen teleria stared at him in astonishment where is magg hes made off with her sire i beg you turn out your guard help me find them eilonwy is in danger of her life what what queen teleria clucked magg the princess youre overwrought young man perhaps the sea air dont shake so and wave your arms about has gone to your dead because someone isnt here for breakfast doesnt mean theyre in danger does it my dear she asked turning to the king i should hardly think so my dear answered rhuddlum this is a heavy charge to bring against a loyal retainer he added looking gravely at taran why do you accuse him for a moment taran stood perplexed and torn gwydion had bound him to secrecy but now that magg had struck must the secret still be kept taking his decision he let the words tumble from his lips hurriedly and often confusedly telling all that had happened since the companions had reached dinas rhydnant queen teleria shook her head this shoemaker disguised as prince gwydion or was it the other way around and ships and torch signals to enchantresses make the wildest tale ive heard young man wild indeed said king rhuddlum but we shall learn the truth easily enough fetch the shoemaker and we shall soon see if he is the prince of don prince gwydion seeks achren taran cried i have given you the truth if it is not so you shall take my life for it will you prove my words fetch your chief steward king rhuddlum frowned it is odd that magg should not be here he admitted very well taran of caer dallben he shall be found and you shall repeat your tale in his presence he clapped his hands and ordered a servitor to summon the chief steward frantic with anxiety knowing that time was fleeting and delay could cost eilonwys life taran was nearly beside himself when the servitor at last returned with tidings that magg appeared to be nowhere in the castle nor could eilonwy be found as king rhuddlum hesitated still puzzled by tarans words gurgi kaw and fflewddur entered the great hall taran raced to them magg that villainous spider the bard exclaimed as soon as taran told him what had happened great belin shes ridden off with him i saw them galloping through the gate i called to her but she didnt hear me she seemed cheerful enough id no idea anything was amiss but theyre gone long gone by now queen teleria turned deathly pale the ladies of the court gasped fearfully king rhuddlum sprang to his feet you have spoken the truth taran of caer dallben shouting for the guard the king strode from the great hall the companions hastened after him at king rhuddlums hurried orders the stables were flung open within moments the courtyard filled with warriors and neighing horses prince rhun meantime had strolled into the courtyard where he peered at the gathering host hullo hullo he called to taran is this a hunting party splendid thought i should enjoy a brisk morning ride a hunt for your traitor steward taran retorted thrusting rhun aside and making his way to king rhuddlum sire where is your war leader give us leave to put ourselves at his service my war leader sorry to say is none other than magg himself the king answered as weve never had a war on mona we never needed a war leader and it seemed quite in order to give magg the honorary title i shall form up the searching party myself as for you yes by all means help with any tasks that need doing while king rhuddlum saw to the ordering of the warriors taran and the companions labored with all speed tightening saddle girths and handing out weapons from the armory prince rhun taran saw had clambered astride a swaybacked piebald mare that persisted in turning in circles despite the efforts of the prince to control her fflewddur and gurgi had led out three horses a glance at the animals filled taran with despair for they seemed unspirited of no great mettle and he wished for the swiftfooted melynlas now grazing peacefully at caer dallben king rhuddlum taking taran by the arm drew him hurriedly into an empty stable you and i must speak together the king said quickly the warriors are ready and divided into two parties one i shall lead over the lands south of the river alaw you and your companions are to ride with my son who shall command the search in the hills of parys north of the alaw it is of him i would speak prince rhun in command taran burst out what then taran of caer dallben king rhuddlum asked sharply do you question prince rhuns skill skill taran cried he has none eilonwys life hangs in the balance our task must be done without delay give command to a feckless fool he can barely knot a sandal lace let alone ride a horse or wield a sword the voyage to mona showed me more than enough choose one of your liege men a warrior a forester anyone save rhun he stopped short dallben has my oath to protect eilonwy and i say what is in my heart were i to say less i would fail my duty if i am to suffer for my words then so be it once again you speak the truth king rhuddlum answered it is not you who suffers for it but i he put a hand on tarans shoulder think you i do not know my own son you are right in your judgment but i know too that rhun must grow to be both a man and a king you carry the burden of an oath to dallben i pray you take the burden of another one word of your deeds has reached mona king rhuddlum went on and i have seen for myself that you are a brave lad and honorable i confide this knowledge to you my master of horse is a skillful tracker he rides with your party and in truth shall direct the search prince rhun commands in name only for the warriors expect leadership from the royal house i would entrust my son to you and beg you to let no harm befall him nor added the king smiling sadly to let him make too great a fool of himself much he has to learn and much perhaps he may learn from you one day he must be king of mona and it is my hope he will rule honorably and wisely with eilonwy his queen eilonwy taran cried with rhun her husband yes answered king rhuddlum when the princess comes of age it is our desire they shall wed princess eilonwy taran murmured confused does she know of this not yet nor does my son said king rhuddlum eilonwy must have time to grow used to mona and our ways here but i am sure it will be happily arranged after all she is a princess and rhun is of royal blood taran bowed his head the grief in his heart kept him from speaking what say you taran of caer dallben king rhuddlum asked will you give me your word from the courtyard taran could hear the clamor of warriors and the voice of fflewddur calling his name yet these sounds reached his ears as though from a great distance he remained silent his eyes downcast in this i do not speak as liege lord to liege man king rhuddlum added i speak as a father who loves his son he paused watching taran closely at last taran met the kings eyes i will swear this oath he said slowly your son will come to no harm if it lies in my power to keep him from it taran put a hand to his sword i pledge my life to do so go with my thanks taran of caer dallben king rhuddlum said and help us bring the princess eilonwy safely home the bard and gurgi were already mounted when taran hurried from the stable heavyhearted he swung into the saddle kaw flew to join him prince rhun who had finally managed to keep his steed from turning in circles was shouting commands unheeded as usual as the searching parties galloped out the gates taran lifted kaw from his shoulder can you find her seek her carefully my friend he murmured while the crow cocked his head and looked at taran with shrewd eyes taran flung his arm upward kaw launched himself into the air and sped aloft wings beating the crow circled overhead drove higher against the sky then disappeared from sight yes yes shouted gurgi waving his arms go with flyings and spyings lead us to evil wicked steward the sooner the better cried fflewddur i cant wait to get my hands on that sneering spider he shall know the fury of a fflam glancing behind him taran saw king rhuddlums band stream from the castle and turn southward ahead the master of horse led his party of warriors toward the higher ground above dinas rhydnant and signaled for the outriders to search for tracks tarans face was set and grim as he rode silently next to fflewddur have no fear the bard assured him we shall bring eilonwy back with us safe and sound before nightfall and all of us shall make merry over this adventure i promise you a new song in celebration you would do well to make it a chant of betrothal taran said bitterly and sing of the wedding of the prince of mona rhun cried the startled fflewddur to be wed i had no idea thats one disadvantage of being lodged in the stables instead of the castle you miss the news and gossip prince rhun indeed who is to be his bride painfully taran told the bard of king rhuddlums plans and of his own oath to keep rhun from harm oho said fflewddur when taran had finished so thats the way the wind blows strange he added with a quick glance at taran i had always hoped that if eilonwy were betrothed to anyone it would be yes well what i mean to say is that despite all the squabbling and bickering between the two of you i had rather expected do not mock me taran burst out reddening eilonwy is a princess of the house of llyr you know my station as well as i such a hope has never been in my mind it is only fitting for eilonwy to be betrothed to one of her own rank angrily he drew away from the bard and galloped ahead so you say so you say murmured fflewddur hurrying after him look closer into your heart you may find your opinion to be somewhat different taran unhearing pressed his steed to join the line of warriors turning northward along the lower slopes of the hills of parys the searching party broke into smaller bands each quartering its own ground the warriors widely separated moved in long wavering lines often out of each others sight painstakingly scouting every possible hiding place yet as the morning wore away and noontide passed they found no trace of the chief steward or eilonwy among the green and gentle slopes ran broken pebbly trails where the fleeing magg might have passed and where clues would be invisible to the eyes of even the most able tracker tarans heart sank in his mind chafed the fear that he was following a false hope and that eilonwy had been taken in an altogether different direction from time to time he anxiously scanned the sky for a glimpse of kaw returning with news of the princess gwydion taran knew was the only one who might discover achrens plan magg was the key but the chief steward had acted so swiftly that perhaps even now he was beyond the reach of the searching party taran redoubled his efforts to find a broken twig a loose stone anything that might bring them closer to eilonwy before nightfall put an end to the days searching gurgi riding close at hand called out to him look look noble prince goes far alone too far into the woods he will lose himself then cheerful hullos will turn to sad moanings and groanings taran who had dismounted to study what seemed a possible trail raised his eyes in time to see prince rhun galloping over the shoulder of a hill he shouted at him but rhun was too distant to hear or more likely taran thought was simply paying no heed he leaped astride his horse and sought to overtake the prince until now he had managed to keep prince rhun always in view but by the time taran reached the hill rhun had vanished into the shadows of an alder grove below on the rapidly darkening meadow fflewddur had cantered into sight and was calling him taran shouted rhuns name once again then beckoned for the bard and gurgi to join him that sickening spider has escaped us today fflewddur cried angrily while his nag labored to the crest but we shall fetch him out tomorrow and eilonwy will be safe and sound if i know the princess magg has already begun to regret stealing her away shes worth a dozen warriors even if shes tied hand and food despite the bards brave words his face looked deeply worried come said fflewddur the master of horse is calling in the warriors were to make camp with them for the night even as the bard spoke taran heard the faint notes of a signal horn he frowned i dare not leave prince rhun to wander alone in the forest in that case replied fflewddur glancing toward the setting sun we had best get hold of him without delay a ffiam is keeneyed but id rather not go stumbling about the countryside after dark if it can possibly be avoided hasten yes yes with hurryings and scurryings cried gurgi fearsome shadows fall and bold but cautious gurgi does not know what hurtful things hide in them the companions rode quickly into the grove where taran felt certain they would find the prince however once beyond the ring of alders and seeing nothing of him tarans alarm grew vainly he called the princes name only the echo returned he can not have ridden far he told the bard even rhun would have wits enough to halt at nightfall darkness covered the grove the horses more used to their quiet stalls in dinas rhydnant than to the forests of mona trod fearfully rearing and shying at every windstirred bush the companions were obliged to dismount and make their way on foot leading the reluctant steeds by this time taran was deeply troubled what had begun as a simple matter had turned grave he might have fallen from his horse taran said even now he might be lying hurt or unconscious then i suggest we find our way back to the rest of the band said fflewddur and ask them to help us in this gloom the more eyes the better we would lose too much time taran answered pressing on through the underbrush gurgi followed whimpering softly to himself the rising ground told taran they were moving above the foothills no sound came but the hiss of saplings that whipped back as he passed and the click of the horses hooves over pale stones taran stopped short his heart in his mouth from a corner of his eye he glimpsed a fleeting movement it lasted but an instant a shadow within a shadow fighting down his fear he groped ahead the horses had turned more skittish than before and tarans mount laid back his ears and voiced a frightened whinny gurgi too had sensed the dark presence the terrified creatures hair rose along his neck and he began to howl pitifully wicked evil things come to follow harmless gurgi oh kind master save gurgis poor tender head from hurtful dangers taran drew his sword and the companions with many backward glances into the darkness hurried on this time the horses did not lag but plunged desperately ahead nearly dragging the bard with them great belin protested fflewddur who had crashed into a tree and struggled to free his jangling harp from a bush hold up there next thing you know well be looking for our own steeds as well as for prince rhun with difficulty taran managed to calm the animals who now refused to budge despite all his coaxing pleading and tugging the horses stood stifflegged and roundeyed their flanks trembling taran himself exhausted sank to the ground our search is blind and useless he said you were right he went on turning to fflewddur we should have gone back the time i had hoped to save is wasted twice over and eilonwys danger is greater with every moment we delay now prince rhun is lost and so is kaw for all we know im afraid youre right sighed fflewddur and unless you or gurgi knows where we are i rather suspect were lost too chapter the potions of glew at these words gurgi set up a wail and rocked back and forth clutching his head taran swallowed his own despair as best he could and tried to reassure the frightened creature we can do nothing now but wait for dawn taran said the master of horse can not be too far away find him as soon as you can above all do not delay the search for eilonwy i shall seek prince rhun he added bitterly i have given my oath to keep him from harm and i can not do otherwise but when i find him ill rejoin you somehow he was silent then his head bowed fflewddur was watching him do not wear out your heart with grief the bard said quietly magg cant escape us for long i dont believe he means to harm eilonwy but only bring her to achren and we shall catch him long before he can do that rest now gurgi and i will share the watch too weary to protest taran stretched out on the ground and covered himself with his cloak no sooner did his eyes close than fears of achren came to torment him in rage and vengeance the haughty queen would slay any of the companions who fell into her hands and eilonwy he dared not let himself imagine her in achrens grasp when at last he dropped into fitful slumber it was as though he slept beneath a millstone the sun had barely risen when he opened his eyes with a start fflewddur was shaking him the bards yellow hair stood out raggedly in all directions his face was pale with fatigue but he grinned broadly good news he cried gurgi and i have done some seekings and peekings of our own were not as badly lost as you might think the truth of it is weve been thrashing around in a circle look for yourself taran sprang to his feet and followed the bard to a low ridge youre right theres the alder grove it must be and there i remember the fallen tree where i lost sight of rhun come he added we shall ride that far together then you must go ahead and catch up with the rest of the band hastily the companions mounted and urged their steeds toward the grove before they reached it tarans horse drew up sharply then bore suddenly to the left a loud whinny rose from the cover of trees along the shoulder of a hill in astonishment taran slackened the reins and let the horse canter freely toward the sound in another few moments he glimpsed a pale shape beyond the foliage as the steed carried him closer he recognized rhuns piebald mare see there he called to fflewddur rhun cant be far we must have gone by him during the night reining up he leaped from the saddle his heart sank the horse stood riderless at the sight of the other steeds she raised her head shook her mane and whickered anxiously fearing the worst taran hurried past the mare while fflewddur and gurgi dismounted and raced after him he stopped short before him in a clearing stood something that looked at first like a huge straw beehive fflewddur by then had come up beside him taran raised a hand in warning and moved cautiously toward the strange hut the conical thatched roof he now saw had fallen away in many places rough stones piled one on top of the other formed a low side wall a corner of which had collapsed into a heap of rubble there were no windows and the single heavy door hung askew from sagging leather hinges he stepped closer the holes in the thatch stared at him like empty eyes fflewddur glanced about him im not too fond of going up and rapping on the door he whispered and asking whoevers inside whether theyve happened to see the prince of mona somehow it seems the kind of place even rhun would rather avoid but i suppose theres no other way to find out just then the door was flung open from the inside gurgi with a yell sought safety by scrambling up a tree tarans hand went to his sword hullo hullo prince rhun beaming stood in the doorway aside from looking a little sleepy he appeared quite himself and altogether unharmed i hope youve got some breakfast with you he added rubbing his hands eagerly im nearly starved to death have you ever noticed how the fresh air sharpens ones appetite most surprising come in come in rhun went on while taran stared speechless at him youd be amazed how comfortable it is surprisingly snug and cozy where did the rest of you pass the night i hope you slept as well as i did you cant imagine taran could control himself no longer what have you done he burst out why did you leave the searching party count yourself lucky that getting lost was the worst that happened to you prince rhun blinked and looked puzzled leave the searching party he asked why i didnt actually leave it not on purpose you understand it happened when i fell off my horse and had to go chasing after her all over nowhere until i found her near this hut by then it was getting dark so i went to sleep thats only common sense wouldnt you say i mean why sleep outdoors when you can put a roof over your head as far as being lost goes rhurt went on it seems to me youre the ones who got lost wherever i go thats where the search is if you see what i mean after all the one whos in command yes you command taran flung back angrily as you were born to as a kings son he stopped abruptly another instant and he would have cried aloud his promise to king rhuddlum and his oath to protect this witless prince taran clenched his teeth prince rhun he said coldly you need not remind us we are under your orders but for your own safety i urge you to stay close to us and i advise you to stay away from strange huts put in fflewddur last time i was in one i almost got changed into a toad the bard shook his head shun them huts that is he added you never know what disagreeable thing youll run into and by the time you find out its too late changed into a toad cried rhun not the least dismayed i say that might be interesting i should like to try it one day but theres nothing like that to worry about no one lives here and they havent for a long time hurry then taran said resolving never again to let prince rhun out of his sight we must join the others well have long hard riding before we catch up to them immediately said rhun who was wearing nothing but his shirt i shall get my things together gurgi meanwhile had clambered down from the tree his curiosity getting the better of his prudence he loped across the clearing and thrust his head into the doorway at last venturing inside with rhun fflewddur and the impatient taran followed him it was taran saw as the prince had told them a heavy layer of dust covered the wooden tables and benches a spider had spun an enormous web in one corner but even the web was deserted on a broken hearthstone lay the charred remnants of a longdead fire near the hearth a number of large cookpots dry and empty now had been overturned earthen bowls and tall jars shattered into fragments were strewn about the floor through the holes in the roof the leaves of more than one autumn had fallen nearly burying a stool whose legs had broken into splinters the hut was silent the noises of the forest did not enter taran stood uneasily while prince rhun fumbled with his gear gurgi fascinated by so many strange odds and ends lost no time in poking through them suddenly he cried out in surprise look look he called holding up a sheaf of tattered parchment taran knelt beside gurgi and examined the ragged bundle the fold mice he realized had discovered the packet long before many of the sheets had been gnawed away others were rain sodden and blotted the few undamaged pages were covered with cramped writing only at the bottom of the pile did taran find pages in good repair these had been carefully bound in leather to make a small tome and their surface was clear and unmarked prince rhun who still had not got around to buckling on his sword came to peer over tarans shoulder i say he cried what have you there i cant guess what it is but it looks interesting and isnt that a handsome little book i shouldnt mind having it to put down things im supposed to remember to do prince rhun taran said handing the undamaged volume to the prince of mona who thrust it into his jacket believe me if theres anything that might ever help you do anything youre welcome to it he went back to puzzling over the parchments between the mice and the weather he went on theres not much to make out of this scrawl there seems to be no beginning or ending but as far as i can tell these are recipes for potions potions cried fflewddur great belin thats something weve little use for taran nevertheless continued to scan and sort the pages wait i think ive found the name of whoever wrote them glew it looks like and the potions as it says here are to his voice faltered and he turned anxiously to fflewddur to make yourself grow bigger what can this mean hows that asked the bard bigger are you sure you havent read it wrong he took the pages from tarans hand and examined them carefully himself when he had finished he gave a low whistle in my wanderings said fflewddur ive managed to learn a number of things not least of which is dont meddle i fear thats exactly what this fellow glew did indeed what he sought was a potion to make himself bigger and stronger if those are glews boots over there he added pointing to the corner he surely needed one for he must have been a little fellow half hidden by leaves a pair of wellworn boots lay on their side they were hardly large enough to fit a child and seemed to taran pitiful in their smallness and emptiness he must have been painstaking fflewddur went on ill say that much for him he describes everything he did and set down all his recipes quite carefully and methodically as for his ingredients the bard said making a sour face i should rather not think about them i say prince rhun eagerly interrupted perhaps we should try them ourselves it would be interesting to see what happens no no gurgi shouted gurgi wants no tastings of nasty lotions and potions nor do i said fflewddur and neither did glew for the matter of that he had no wish to drink his concoctions until he had some hope theyd work for which i cant blame him in the least he went about it very cleverly as i gather from what hes written down here continued the bard he went out and trapped a mountain cat a small one i should think since glew himself was such a small person he brought her back put her in a cage and fed her his potions as fast as he could cook them up poor creature said taran indeed agreed the bard i shouldnt have liked to be in her place yet he must have grown fond enough of her to give her a name here hes written it down llyan apart from feeding her those dreadful messes i expect he didnt treat her badly she might even have been company for him living alone as he did at last it happened fflewddur went on you can see by his writing how excited glew must have been llyan began to grow glees mentions he was obliged to make a new cage for her and still another how pleased he must have been i can easily imagine the little fellow chuckling and brewing away for all he was worth fflewddur turned to the last page and so it ends he said where the mice have eaten the parchment theyve done away with glews last recipe as for glew and llyan theyve vanished along with it taran was silent looking at the empty boots and overturned cookpots glew certainly is gone he said thoughtfully but i have a feeling he didnt go far hows that asked the bard oh i take your meaning he said shuddering yes it does look rather shall i say sudden as i see glew he was a neat and orderly sort he would hardly go off leaving his hut as it is now without his boots at that poor little fellow he sighed it only proves the dangers of meddling for all his pains glew must have got himself gobbled up and if you ask me the wisest thing for us is to leave immediately taran nodded and rose to his feet as he did terrified whinnyings and the sound of galloping hooves filled the air the horses he cried racing to the door before he could reach it the door burst from its hinges taran clutched at his sword and stumbled back into the hut as a huge shape leaped at him chapter the lair of llyan tarans blade went spinning from his grasp and he threw himself to the ground to escape the onslaught in a powerful spring the creature passed over his head the great beast screamed with fury as the companions scattered in terror to all parts of the hut amid the confusion of tumbling stools and benches and as the dry leaves rose in a whirlwind taran saw that fflewddur had jumped to a tabletop and in so doing had plunged into the spiderweb which now covered him from head to foot prince rhun having tried vainly to climb up the chimney crouched in the ashes of the hearth gurgi had made himself as small as he could and had pressed into a corner where he squealed and yelled help oh help save gurgis poor tender head from pawings and clawings its llyan cried taran you can be sure it is fflewddur shouted now that i see her i quite believe glew was gobbled up and digested long ago a long wavering growl rose from the creatures throat and she hesitated a moment as if undecided where to attack taran sitting up on the ground saw for the first time what the ferocious animal looked like though glew had written of llyans growth taran had never imagined a mountain cat so big the animal stood as tall as a horse but leaner and longer her tail alone thicker than tarans arm seemed to take up much of the room in the hut heavily and sleekly furred the cats body was goldentawny flecked with black and orange her belly was white with black splotches curling tufts sprouted from the tips of her ears and shaggy handfuls of fur curved at her powerful jaws her long whiskers twitched her baleful yellow eyes darted from one companion to another judging from the white points of her teeth glittering as her lips drew back in a snarl taran was certain llyan could gulp down anything that suited her fancy the giant cat swung her great head toward taran and moved lithely across the ground as she did fflewddur unsheathed his sword cobwebs and all he jumped from the table shouted at the top of his voice and brandished the weapon in an instant llyan spun around the lash of her tail sent taran headlong once more even before fflewddur could strike llyans heavy paw flickered through the air its motion was too rapid for tarans eyes to follow he saw only the astonished bards weapon fly up and clatter into the doorway whip fflewddur himself went head over heels with a snort and what seemed a shrug of her rippling shoulders llyan turned again to taran she crouched thrust out her neck and her whiskers trembled as she padded closer to him taran not daring to move a muscle held his breath llyan circled him making snuffling noises from the corner of his eye taran glimpsed the bard trying to climb to his feet and warned fflewddur to stay still shes more curious than angry taran whispered otherwise she would have clawed us to pieces by now dont move she may go away glad to hear you say that replied fflewddur in a choked voice ill remember it while im being gobbled up it will be a consolation to me i dont think shes hungry said taran if shes been out hunting during the night she must have eaten her fill so much the worse for us said fflewddur shell keep us here until her appetite comes back im sure this is the first time shes been lucky enough to have four dinners ready and waiting in her lair he sighed and shook his head in my own realm i was always putting out scraps for birds and other creatures but i never thought id see the day when id be putting myself out if you take my meaning at last llyan settled herself across the doorway she moistened a huge paw with her tongue and began passing it over her ear engrossed in her task she seemed to have forgotten the companions were there despite his fear taran could not help staring at her in fascination power filled even llyans gentlest movements beneath the golden fur glowing in the sunlight from the open door he could guess at her mighty muscles llyan he was certain could be swift as melynlas but he knew also she could be deadly and though she did not appear illdisposed toward the companions her mood might change at any instant taran cast about desperately for a way to freedom or at least a means of regaining their weapons fflewddur he whispered make a little noise not too much but enough so that llyan will look at you hows that asked the bard puzzled look at me shell do that soon enough im thankful she hasnt yet got around to it however he scraped his boots across the floor llyan immediately pricked up her ears and turned her eyes on the bard crouching taran moved silently toward llyan his hand outstretched his fingers cautiously reached for his sword which lay close to llyans paws quick as lightning the mountain cat struck at him and he fell back had her claws been unsheathed taran realized with a sinking feeling llyan would have gained his head in addition to his weapon no chance my friend said fflewddur shes faster than any of us we can be hindered no longer taran cried time is precious oh indeed it is the bard answered and gets more precious the less of it we have im beginning to envy princess eilonwy magg may be a foul villainous spider and all such as that but when it comes to teeth and claws i should vastly prefer going against him instead of llyan no no he sighed im quite content to stretch my last moments as far as theyll reach taran in despair pressed his hands against his forehead prince rhun he called softly after a moment as llyan began passing a paw over her whiskers stand up quietly see if you can make your way to that broken corner of the hut if so climb out and run for your life the prince of mona nodded but no sooner had he risen to his feet than llyan growled a warning prince rhun blinked and quickly sat down again llyan glared at the companions great belin whispered fflewddur dont rouse her up any more it will only bring on her appetite shes not going to let us out of here thats one thing sure but we must escape taran urged what if we all rushed upon her once one of us at least might get past fflewddur shook his head after shed settled with the rest of us he answered shed have no trouble catching up with that lone survivor let me think let me think frowning he reached behind him and unslung his harp llyan still growling watched intently but made no further move it always calms me explained fflewddur putting the instrument against his shoulder and passing his hands over the harp strings i dont know whether it will stir up any ideas but when im playing at least things dont seem quite so dismal as a soft melody rose from the harp llyan began making a peculiar noise great belin cried fflewddur stopping immediately i almost forgot about her it may be calming for me but who can tell what it might do to a mountain cat llyan now voiced a strange pleading yowl but seeing fflewddur about to sling the harp on his shoulder once again her tone changed and sharpened she growled menacingly fflewddur taran whispered play on you cant think she enjoys it replied the bard i should find that hard to believe why even human beings have been known to say hard words about my music you cant expect a mountain cat to like it any better nevertheless he plucked the strings once more this time there was no doubt in tarans mind that llyan was fascinated by the harp the great body of the cat slackened her muscles seemed to uncoil and llyan blinked peacefully to make certain taran asked fflewddur to stop as soon as the bard did so llyan turned restless her tail lashed and her whiskers trembled with what could only be vexation as soon as the bard played again llyan put her head to one side ears forward and gazed fondly at him yes yes gurgi cried do not leave off hummings and strummings believe me the bard answered fervently i havent the slightest intention llyan folded her paws under her deep speckled chest and began making a sound like a swarm of droning bees her mouth curved in a smile and the tip of her tail moved gently to the music thats the answer cried fflewddur springing to his feet fly friends while shes quiet no sooner had he risen than llyan too jumped up furious and the bard sank back playing for dear life your music calms her taran cried in alarm but she still wont let us go not exactly said the bard passing his fingers rapidly across the strings i doubt if the rest of you will have any trouble alas he added ruefully i fear im the one she wants to keep chapter the harp of fflewddur fly from here urged the bard never ceasing to pluck his harp strings begone ive no idea how long shell want to listen or how long i can keep playing there must be another way taran cried we cant leave you i like it no more than you do replied the bard but this is your chance you must take it now taran hesitated fflewddurs face was grim and drawn and he seemed already weary begone fflewddur repeated ill play as long as i can by then if shes decided not to gobble me she may go out hunting dont worry if the harp fails ill think of something else sick at heart taran turned away llyan lay on her side across the threshold one paw outstretched the other gently curled against her tawny body her neck arched and her huge head turned toward fflewddur the fierce creature seemed altogether comfortable and peaceful with yellow eyes half closed she watched only the bard as taran stealthily moved to join gurgi and prince rhun tarans sword remained with the other weapons beneath her paw and he dared not attempt to snatch it away fearful as he was of breaking the spell of fflewddurs harp the fallen stones at the corner of the hut gave a narrow passage into the clearing taran motioned hurriedly for the prince to go through gurgi followed on tiptoe eyes wide with fright he clutched his jaws in both hands to keep his teeth from chattering taran still hung back and turned once more to the bard who gestured frantically out out commanded fflewddur i shall find you as soon as i can did i not promise you a new song you shall hear it from my own lips until then farewell fflewddurs tone and glance left no room for question taran flung himself past the stones in another instant he was free of the hut as taran feared the horses had broken their tethers and fled at the sight of llyan gurgi and prince rhun had crossed the clearing and vanished into the forest racing at top speed taran soon caught up with them rhuns pace had already begun to flag his breathing was labored and he looked as though his legs might give way at any moment taran and gurgi caught the staggering prince and bore him along as fast as they could for some while the three struggled through the underbrush the forest had begun to grow sparser and taran caught sight of a broad meadow at the edge of the flatland he halted prince rhun he knew had reached the end of his strength and he hoped only that they were a safe distance from llyan the prince of mona gratefully dropped to the turf i shall be up and about in a moment he feebly insisted his face was pale and drawn beneath its coating of soot yet he tried valiantly to assume his usual cheerful grin amazing how running seems to tire one ill be glad when we find the master of horse and i can ride again taran did not answer immediately but looked closely at rhun the prince of mona bowed his head i can guess what youre thinking rhun said in a low voice if it hadnt been for me you wouldnt be in this plight and im afraid youre right its my fault things turned out as they did i can only ask your forgiveness im not the cleverest person in the world rhun added smiling sadly even my old nurse used to say i was all thumbs but i hate being a blunderer its not what people expect of a prince i didnt ask to be born into the royal house that at least wasnt my doing but since i was i i want very much to be worthy of it if you want to then you shall taran answered suddenly and strangely touched by the prince of monas frankness and not a little ashamed of his own unkind thoughts about rhun i ask your own forgiveness if i envied your rank it was because i believed you held it as a lucky gift and took it for granted you speak the truth for a man to be worthy of any rank he must strive first to be a man yes thats what i mean rhun said eagerly thats why we must rejoin the master of horse as soon as we can dont you see in this id hoped not to fail i want well i want to be the one who finds princess eilonwy after all im to be betrothed to her taran looked at him in astonishment how do you know this i had thought only your parents oh there have been rumors around the castle replied rhun and i sometimes hear a little more than im supposed to i knew there was a betrothal in the wind even before i was sent to bring princess eilonwy to mona eilonwys safe return is all that matters now taran began he spoke slowly knowing in his heart that he no less than rhun yearned to be eilonwys rescuer but he realized there was a decision he must face without flinching the searchers by this time are far distant taran said each word costing him an effort yet each word forcing him to a choice as painful as it was clear without horses we can not hope to reach them continuing our own search on foot would be too hard and too dangerous we have only one path to follow the one that will lead us back to dinas rhydnant no no rhun cried i dont care about the danger i must find eilonwy prince rhun taran said gently i must also tell you this your father asked for my oath and i have given it to keep you from harm rhuns face fell i might have guessed as much certainly i knew from the beginning no matter what my father said about putting me in command i wasnt really leading no more than i am now i understand im under your orders whatevers to be done you are the one to decide there are others who can finish the task taran said as for us see with lookings burst out gurgi who had been crouching near a fallen ash tree see coming with chasings and racings he waved his arms excitedly and pointed to a low ridge taran made out a figure running at top speed his harp bouncing at his shoulder his cloak rolled up and clutched under one arm and his lanky legs pumping for all they were worth the bard dashed down the slope he flung himself to the ground and mopped his streaming face great belin fflewddur gasped im glad to see all of you again from his cloak he drew out the lost swords and handed them to the companions and i think we shall all be glad to see these are you wounded taran asked how did you escape how did you find us still puffing the bard raised a hand give me a moment to catch my breath for i lost it somewhere along the way wounded well yes in a manner of speaking he added glancing at his blistered fingers but i had no trouble finding you rhun must have carried off all the ashes in glews fireplace i could hardly miss the trail as for llyan fflewddur went on the bards will sing of that you can be sure i must have played sung whistled and hummed everything i ever knew and twice over i was sure id have to keep plucking and strumming for the rest of my life however short that might be recall my plight he cried leaping to his feet alone with a ferocious monster bard against beast beast against bard you slew her taran exclaimed a bold stroke though a pity for she was beautiful in her way ah well the truth of it is fflewddur said hastily for the harp strings had tensed as though they might all break at once she finally went to sleep i snatched up our swords and ran for dear life fflewddur sank back to the turf and immediately began munching the food gurgi had offered him but i shouldnt vouch for llyans temper when she wakens the bard continued shes bound to come after me these mountain cats are trackers born and since llyans ten times bigger than an ordinary creature shes surely ten times more cunning shell not give up easily i have the feeling her patience is as long as her tail but im surprised youve not gone farther i thought youd be well on your way to join the search taran shook his head he told the bard of the decision to return to dinas rhydnant i suppose its the best thing to do fflewddur reluctantly agreed especially now when llyan may be prowling taran scanned the hills for the easiest and safest path to follow he caught his breath a dark shape sped high above it veered circled then drove directly toward him its kaw taran ran ahead and held out his arms the crow dropped swiftly and lighted on tarans outstretched wrist the bird showed signs of grueling flight his feathers were askew and he looked like a bundle of rags but he clacked his beak and jabbered excitedly eilonwy kaw croaked eilonwy chapter the luck of rhun hes found her taran shouted as the companions pressed around the frantic crow where has magg taken her alaw croaked kaw alaw the river taran exclaimed how far is it close close replied kaw no question of going back to dinas rhydnant now cried prince rhun maggs in our hands well have the princess back again in no time at all if llyan doesnt have us in her paws first muttered fflewddur he turned to taran can kaw bear word to the master of horse i dont mind telling you i should feel safer with a few warriors behind me we dare not lose time taran answered prince rhun is right we must act now or magg will slip through our fingers quickly old friend he said to kaw urging the crow aloft guide us to the alaw they set off in haste the crow fluttered from one tree to the next jabbering impatiently until the companions drew closer then launching himself once more into the air kaw streaked onward in the direction he wished them to follow the crow taran knew was doing his best to bring them as quickly as possible out of the hills but many times the forest and underbrush formed such a tangled barrier the companions were forced to draw their swords and hack their way through their path did not ease until well past midday when kaw led them across a low rolling plain which soon fell into pebbly ravines the turf was short and stubbly with many splotches of bare ground where chalkwhite boulders were strewn like giant hailstones with all of rhuddlums warriors combing mona fflewddur cried angrily as they began the descent toward the river how has that spider managed to escape us for so long magg has been more cunning than we thought taran said bitterly im sure he took eilonwy into the hills of parys but he must have hidden away without moving until he knew the search had swept beyond him the villain fflewddur snorted so it must have been while we all went tracking farther and farther away from the castle that foul magg waited at his ease until wed gone so far ahead that he was behind us no matter well soon have him by the heels and hell pay for that trick kaw circling in great loops above the companions had grown more agitated and began a raucous croaking taran caught a glimpse of the alaw flashing below kaw in a burst of speed flew directly toward it with prince rhun gasping and puffing behind them the companions ran down the slope kaw lighting on a branch madly flapped his wings tarans heart sank there was no trace of eilonwy or magg in another moment he dropped to one knee fflewddur he shouted quickly here are hoof prints two horses he followed the trail for a few paces then halted puzzled see this he said to the bard and gurgi who had come up beside him the tracks follow different paths i dont understand what could have happened prince rhun he called can you see anything of the steeds no answer came from the prince of mona taran leaped to his feet and spun about rhun he cried but there was no sign whatever of the prince hes wandered off again taran shouted furiously feckless dolt where has he gone calling anxiously for rhun the three raced on to the riverbank taran was about to set off alone to seek him when the prince of mona appeared from a stand of willows hullo hullo rhun hurried forward beamging delightedly before the relieved but angry taran could take him to task the prince called out look at this amazing really astonishing prince rhun held our his hand in it lay eilonwys bauble his heart pounding taran stared at the golden sphere where did you find this why over there answered rhun pointing to a mosscovered rock while you were looking at hoof prints i thought i might go and search somewhere else to save us time and this is what i found he handed the bauble to taran who carefully tucked it into his jacket hes led us to fresh tracks said fflewddur studying the grass something fairly large and flat has been dragged along here he scratched his chin thoughtfully i wonder a boat could it be did that sneering spider have one ready and waiting i shouldnt be surprised if he had planned it all before eilonwy reached mona taran strode down the bank i see footprints he called the ground is badly torn eilonwy must have struggled with him yes right there and there she would have dropped the bauble in dismay he looked at the wide rapidflowing alaw you have read the signs well fflewddur he said magg had a boat here he set loose the horses and let them run as they pleased taran stood a moment watching the turbulent water then drew his sword come lend me a hand he called to gurgi and the bard and ran to the willows i say what have you in mind cried rhun as taran chopped hastily at the lower branches making a fire theres hardly any need we can build a raft replied taran throwing the cut branches on the ground the river has helped magg now it shall help us the companions ripped vines from the tree trunks and lashed the cut branches together lengthening the makeshift cords with strips torn from their own garments ungainly though it was and looking more like a bundle of kindling wood the raft was soon ready but no sooner had taran begun tying the last knots in the tangle of vines and rags when gurgi shrieked in fear taran leaped to his feet and spun around as gurgi gestured wildly toward the trees farther up the riverbank llyan had burst from the woods the great tawny mountain cat halted for an instant one paw raised her tail lashing her eyes blazing at the companions who fell back in terror the raft txran shouted into the river with it he seized one end of the clumsy craft and struggled to haul it to the water still yelling gurgi ran to aid him prince rhun toiled as best he could to help the bard had already splashed into the stream where he stood hipdeep in the current and heaved at the branches llyans tufted ears cupped forward and her whiskers twitched as her glance fell on the bard from her throat arose not a savage roar but a belllike questioning cry eyes shining with a strange glow she loped forward on huge padded paws purring loudly the mountain cat made straight for the frantic bard great belin cried fflewddur she wants me back again it was then that kaw perched on a low branch beat his wings and launched himself against llyan squawking and croaking at the top of his voice the crow swooped down on the astonished beast llyan stopped in her tracks and roared angrily flying at full speed kaw passed within a hairs breadth of llyans mighty head striking out with his wings and pecking at her with his sharp beak taken by surprise llyan fell back on her haunches and turned to face the crow kaw veered in a tight circle and swooped again llyan sprang into the air claws unsheathed and slashing taran cried in dismay as a cloud of feathers floated downward but an instant later he saw the crow still aloft and plunging again toward llyan dancing in front of her like a large black hornet kaw jabbered impudently as though daring the beast to catch him flapped his wings inher face and sped away once more at his next dive which brought him so close that llyans teeth snapped shut on one of his tail feathers kaw seized and tweaked a curling whisker yowling furiously forgetting the bard and the struggling companions llyan raced after the crow who flapped from the riverbank into the woods llyan followed and her roars echoed among the trees with a final heave the companions flung the raft into the river and scrambled aboard the current snatched and spun the craft nearly capsizing it before taran could thrust a pole into the water fflewddur and gurgi fended the raft off a threatening boulder prince rhun drenched to the skin paddled desperately with his hands in another moment the raft righted itself and the companions skimmed rapidly downstream fflewddur whose face had turned deathly pale gave a sigh of relief i feared she had me for sure believe me i couldnt stand another bout of harping like the last one i hope kaw fares well he added anxiously kaw will find us again taran assured him hes clever enough to stay out of llyans reach until he knows were safe if she keeps chasing him im certain shell have the worst of the battle fflewddur nodded then turned and glanced back over his shoulder in a way he said with a note of regret in his voice its the first time my music has really been ah in a manner of speaking sought after in this case if it werent so dangerous i should call it downright complimentary i say called prince rhun crouching at the front of the raft i dont mean to complain after all the work youve done but i think somethings breaking loose taran busy steering glanced down in alarm the hurriedly knotted vines had begun to give way the raft shuddered in the swift current with the pole taran thrust deeply for the river bottom seeking to bring the raft to a halt the current bore it onward and the branches bent and twisted as the water poured through the gaps one of the vines parted a branch ripped free then another throwing aside the useless pole taran shouted for the companions to jump clear seizing prince rhun by the jacket he sprang into the river as the water closed over his head prince rhun kicked and struggled wildly taran tightened his grasp on the floundering prince and fought his way to the surface with a free hand he clung to a boulder and gained a foothold among the shifting stones heaving with all his strength he dragged rhun ashore and flung him to the bank gurgi and fflewddur had managed to catch hold of what remained of the raft and were hauling it into the shallows prince rhun sat up and looked around thats the closest ive ever been to drowning he gasped ive often wondered what it was like though now i dont think id care to know drowning said fflewddur staring at the wreckage of the craft worse than that all our labor has gone for naught taran rose wearily to his feet most of the branches can be used well cut more vines and start again the discouraged companions turned to the task of repairing the raft now strewn in pieces along the bank the work went more slowly than before for the trees grew sparser here and vines were scarce the prince of mona had made his way to a clump of osiers and taran glimpsed him tugging away trying to uproot them the next instant rhun was no longer in sight with a shout of alarm taran dropped his armload of vines and ran toward the spot calling rhuns name the bard looked up not again he cried if there were a field with one stone hed trip over it a fflam is patient but there are limits nevertheless he hurried to join taran who was already kneeling among the osiers at the spot where rhun had been standing was a gaping hole the prince of mona had vanished chapter the cavern heedless of fflewddurs warning shout taran leaped into the pit and slid quickly past a mesh of torn roots the hole widened a little then dropped straight calling for the bard to lower a length of vine he let himself fall then scrambled to his feet and struggled to lift up the unconscious rhun who was bleeding heavily from a gash at the side of his head the end of the vine dangled from above taran seized and lashed it securely under the princes arms shouting for fflewddur and gurgi to pull him up the vine tautened strained and snapped earth and stones showered from the raw sides of the hole beware taran cried the ground is giving way afraid youre right fflewddur called back in that case i think wed better give you a hand from down there taran saw the soles of fflewddurs boots plunge toward him the bard landed with a grunt and gurgi whose hair looked as though it had scraped away most of the dirt from the hole tumbled after prince rhuns eyelids fluttered hullo hullo he murmured what happened those roots were surprisingly deep the land must be eaten away along the riverbank taran said when you pulled the strain and weight opened up this hole never fear he added quickly well soon have you out help us to turn you can you move at all the prince nodded gritted his teeth and with the companions lifting him began painfully clambering up the side of the pit but he had gone no more than halfway when he lost his handhold taran scrambled to block his fall rhun clutched wildly at a root and hung poised a moment in midair the root tore free and rhun plummeted downward the wall of earth rumbled as the pit collapsed around them taran flung up his arms against the rush of soil and shale he was thrown down the ground cracked at his feet fell away and left him spinning in nothingness a violent shock stunned him loose earth filled his nose and mouth lungs bursting he fought against the weight pressing the life from him it was only then he realized he had stopped falling his head still reeled but he twisted and clawed his way through dirt and pebbles he heaved himself upward breathing once again gasping and trembling he dropped at full length on a sloping rocky floor in darkness so deep it seemed to suffocate him at last regaining strength enough to lift his head he tried vainly to peer through the shadows that filled his eyes he called to the companions but no answer came his voice rang with a strange hollow echo in despair he shouted once more hullo hullo called another voice prince rhun taran cried where are youm are you safe i dont know answered the prince if i could see better i could tell you better raising himself to hands and knees taran crawled forward his groping fingers met a shaggy mass that stirred and whimpered terrible oh terrible moaned gurgi rumblings and crumblings fling poor gurgi into fearsome blackness he can not see great belin came fflewddurs voice out of the dark im delighted to hear that for a moment i thought id been struck blind i swear i can see more with my eyes shut ordering gurgi to hang on to his belt taran crept in the direction of the bards voice soon the companions had fond each other again and also prince rhun who hd managed to drag himself toward them fflewddur taran said in an anxious voice i fear the landslide has blocked the pit dare we try to dig our way out i dont think its so much a question of digging as it is of finding if you take my meaning replied the bard whether we can burrow through all that dirt is to say the least of it highly doubtful even a mole would have trouble though im willing to give it a try a fflam is undaunted but he added without a light to guide us we shall spend the rest of our days looking for the right spot to dig taran nodded and knitted his brows its true light is as precious to us as air he turned to gurgi try to use your flints we have no tinder here but if i can catch the spark in my cloak it may be enough to set it alight he heard rustling slapping sounds as though gurgi were searching himself all over and then a dismal wail fire stones are gone gurgi moaned wretched gurgi can not make bright blazing he has lost them oh misery and sorrow gurgi will go alone to seek them taran patted the creatures shoulder stay with us here he said i value your life more than fire stones we shall find some other way wait he cried eilonwys bauble if only it will light for us quickly he thrust into his jacket and drew out the sphere for a moment he held it covered in his hands fearing disappointment should the bauble fail to glow holding his breath he slowly moved a hand away the golden sphere lay cupped in his palm he could feel its smooth cool surface and its weight which was somehow not weight at all he sensed the eyes of the companions on him and could guess at their hopeful glances but the darkness pressed heavier and more stifling than ever the bauble gave not the slightest glimmer i can not do it taran murmured i fear it is not given to an assistant pigkeeper to command such a thing of beauty and enchantment no sense in my trying said prince rhun i know i cant make it work the very first time i held it the thing blinked out the moment it was in my hands surprising the princess eilonwy could light it so easily taran groped toward fflewddur and put the sphere into his hand you know the lore of the bards and the ways of enchantments he urged perhaps it will obey you try fflewddur our lives depend on it yes well replied fflewddur i must admit i have no great skill in these things the true lore of the bards sorry to say has always been a little beyond me theres simply too much to know and i could never squeeze more than a drop or two into my head but a fflam is willing moments passed then taran heard fflewddur sigh with discouragement cant get the hang of it muttered the bard i even tried rapping it on the ground but that doesnt do either here let our friend gurgi have a go at it woe and sorrow moaned gurgi after the bard had passed the sphere to him and he had held it for a while even with teasings and squeezings even with battings and pattings unhappy gurgi can not bring golden winkings a fflam never despairs cried fflewddur but he added dolefully im coming rapidly to believe this pit will be our grave without even a decent mound to mark the spot a fflam is cheerful but this is a disheartening situation no matter how you look at it gurgi silently gave the bauble back to taran who heavy hearted cupped it in his hands again with yearning now he held it and his mind turned from his own plight to thoughts of eilonwy he saw her face and once more heard her gay laughter ring clearer than the notes of fflewddurs harp he smiled to himself even as he recalled her chattering and her sharp words he was about to return the bauble to his jacket but stopped short and stared at his hand a point of light had begun to flicker in the depths of the sphere as he watched not daring to breathe it blossomed and shimmered taran sprang to his feet with a cry not of triumph but of wonder golden beams shone around him faintly but steadily trembling he raised the sphere high above his head kind master saves us cried gurgi yes yes he takes us from loomings and gloomings joy and happiness fearful darkness is gone gurgi can see again amazing cried prince rhun astonishing look at this cave i never knew we had such a place on mona again taran cried out in wonder until now he had believed they had fallen into something like a large burrow the glow of eilonwys bauble showed they had come instead to the edge of an enormous cavern it stretched before them like a forest after an ice storm columns of stone rose like the trunks of trees and arched to the ceiling where stone icicles clung along the shadowy walls huge outcroppings sprang like hawthorn blossoms and glittered in the baubles golden rays threads of scarlet and vivid green twisted through luminous shafts of rock white tendrils of crystal curled along jagged walls gleaming with rivulets of water still other chambers lay beyond this one and taran caught sight of wide pools flat and glistening as mirrors some gave a dull greenish glow others a pale blue what have we found taran whispered can this be a part of the fair folks realm fflewddur shook his head the fair folk surely have tunnels and caves where youd least expect them but i doubt this is one theres no sign of life at all gurgi did not speak but stared with round eyes at the cavern prince rhun an expression of delight on his face stepped ahead i say this really is surprising he said i shall have to tell my father about this and see if he wont open it up to visitors it would be a shame to keep it hidden away it is a place of great beauty taran said in a hushed voice and a deadly place for us replied fflewddur a fflam enjoys the scenery thats one advantage of being a wandering bard but from the ah outside if i make myself clear which i believe is where we should put ourselves as quickly as we can the companions retraced their steps to where the landslide had carried them as taran had feared the light of the golden ball showed that digging a passage would be vain for heavy boulders filled the pit blocking it entirely while prince rhun rested on one of the tablelike stones and gurgi delved into his wallet for food taran and fflewddur spoke hastily between themselves we must find another passage taran said king rhuddlum and his men will never reach eilonwy now we are the only ones who know the direction magg has taken all too true fflewddur glumly replied yet i fear that knowledge is going to stay locked up with us here achren herself couldnt have thrown us into a stronger prison there are surely other ways in and out the bard went on but these caverns can stretch who knows how far underground they may be enormous and the entry no bigger than a rabbit hole nevertheless they agreed they had no choice but to continue into the cavern and seek a passage leading them above ground keeping the prince of mona protectively between them taran and the bard set off through the forest of stone with gurgi trotting behind and clutching tarans belt without warning prince rhun suddenly cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted hullo hullo at the top of his voice anyone here hullo rhun taran cried be silent you will bring more danger on us i should hardly think so answered rhun innocently it seems to me that finding someone or something is better than finding nothing at all and risk our necks doing so taran retorted he halted until the echoes had died away no further sound came from the reaches of the cavern and taran warily beckoned the companions forward the ground dipped and they found themselves amid stones that jutted like huge teeth from the ground farther on the cavern floor rolled and twisted in high waves and deep valleys as though a stormy sea had been frozen motionless another chamber held massive piles of rock and tall mounds that had taken the fanciful shapes of unmoving clouds here the toiling companions rested a moment for the path had narrowed and grown more difficult the air was heavy stagnant as swamp water and chilled them to the bone taran urged them to their feet once again anxious to find a tunnel leading upward but fearing more and more that their search would be long and painful a glance at the bards face told taran that fflewddur shared his fears i say theres an odd thing called rhun pointing to a tumble of rock it was indeed one of the strangest shapes taran had seen in the cavern for it looked like a hens egg sticking halfway out of a nest the stone was white smooth and somewhat pointed at the top crusted here and there with patches of lichen and stood nearly as tall as taran himself what at first resembled a nest was a tangled discolored fringe of coarse strands that seemed to balance on the edge of a sharp drop amazing called rhun who had insisted on striding closer to peer at it this isnt a rock at all he turned in surprise to the companions this is unbelievable but its almost like taran seized the astonished rhun and dragged him backward so abruptly the prince nearly went head over heels gurgi yelped in terror the shape had begun to move two colorless eyes appeared in a face pale as a dead fish the eyebrows glittered with flecks of crystal moss and mold edged the long flapping ears and spread over the beard that sprouted below a lumpy nose swords drawn the companions huddled against the jagged wall the huge head continued to rise and taran saw it wobble on a skinny neck a choking noise bubbled in the creatures throat as it cried puny things tremble before me tremble i tell you i am glew i am glew chapter king of the stones gurgi flung himself to the ground covered his head with his hands and whimpered piteously the creature threw a long spindly leg over the ledge and began slowly drawing himself upright he was more than thrice as tall as taran and his flabby arms dangled below a pair of knobby mosscovered knees with a lopsided gait he shambled toward the companions glew taran gasped but i was sure it cant be whispered fflewddur impossible not little glew or if it is i certainly got the wrong impression of him tremble the quavering voice cried again you shall tremble great belin muttered the bard who was indeed shaking so much he had almost dropped his blade i dont need to be told the giant bent shaded his white eyes against the light of the bauble and peered at the companions are you really trembling he asked in an anxious voice youre not doing it just to be obliging gurgi meantime had ventured to lift his hands from his face but the sight of the creature towering above him made him clap them back again and set him to wailing louder than ever prince rhun however recovering from his first shock studied the monster with great curiosity i say this is the first ive seen anyone with toadstools growing in his beard he remarked did he do it on purpose or did it just happen that way if thats the glew we know said the bard hes changed remarkably the giants pale eyes widened what would have been a smile on a face of ordinary size became a grin that stretched longer than tarans arm glew blinked and stooped closer youve heard of me then he asked eagerly indeed we have put in rhun its amazing but we thought llyan prince rhun taran warned glew for the moment seemed to have no wish to harm them instead evidently pleased by the consternation he had wrought among the companions he was looking down at them with an expression of satisfaction all the more intense because it was so large but until he had learned more of this strange creature taran had deemed it wiser to say nothing of their search llyan glew quickly asked what do you know of llyan since rhun had already spoken taran had no choice but to admit the companions had stumbled upon glews hut disclosing no more than he had to taran told of finding the recipes for the potions whether glew would take kindly to strangers rummaging among his possessions taran did not know to his relief the giant showed less concern about that than he did for the fate of the mountain cat oh llyan cried glew if only she were here anything to keep me company at this he buried his face in his hands and the cavern echoed with his sobs now now said fflewddur dont take on so youre lucky you werent gobbled up gobbled sniffed glew raising his head better if i had been any doom rather than this miserable cavern theres bats you know theyve always terrified me swooping and squeaking in that nasty way they have crawly white worms come popping their heads out of the rocks and stare at you and spidery things and things that are just just things theyre the worst its enough to curdle your blood i tell you the other day if i may call it day for all the difference it makes down here the giant bent forward his voice dropped to a roaring whisper and he appeared eager to recount these happenings at great length glew taran interrupted we pity your plight but i beg you show us a way out of the cavern glew rocked his huge scraggly head from side to side way out ive never stopped looking for one there isnt any not for me at least there must be insisted taran how did you find your way into the cave in the first place please show us find my way replied glexv i should hardly call it a question of finding it was llyans fault if only she hadnt broken from her cage the one time my potion was working so well she chased me out of my hut ungrateful of her but i forgive her i still had the flask in my hand oh how i wish id thrown the wretched potion away i ran as fast as i could with llyan after me glew patted his forehead with a trembling hand and blinked sorrowfully ive never run so fast and so far in my life he said i still dream of it when im not dreaming of worse finally i found a cave and into it i went i hadnt a moment to spare continued glew sighing heavily i swallowed the potion now that ive had time to think it over i realize i shouldnt have but it had made llyan so much bigger i thought it would do the same for me so i might have a chance against her and so it did he added in fact it worked so quickly i nearly broke my crown on the ceiling of the cafe and i kept on growing i had to squeeze along as fast as i could going farther and farther downward always looking for bigger chambers until i ended here by then alas no passage was wide enough to let me out ive thought a great deal about it since that unhappy day i often look back on it glew went on he half closed his eyes and peered into the distance lost in his own recollections i wonder now he murmured i wonder now if fflewddur taran whispered in the bards ear is there no way we can make him stop talking and show us one of the passages or should we try to slip by him and find it ourselves i dont know answered fflewddur from all the giants ive seen yes well the truth of it is ive never seen any myself though ive heard enough of them glew seems rather how shall i say it small i dont know if im making myself clear but he was a feeble little fellow to begin with and now hes a feeble little giant and very likely a coward im sure we could fight him if we could reach him our biggest risk would be getting stepped on and squashed im truly sorry for him taran began but i dont know how we can help him and we dare not delay our search youre not listening cried glew who had been talking on at some length before realizing he was talking mainly to himself yes its the same thing all over again he sobbed even if im a giant no one pays me any mind oh i can tell you there are giants that would crack your bones and squeeze you until your eyes popped youd listen to them you can be sure but not glew oh it makes no difference about him giant or no glew the giant mewed up in a wretched cave and whos to care whos even to see now look here answered fflewddur with some impatience for the giant had begun to sob and splash the companions with tears youve only yourself to blame if youve put yourself into a stew you meddled and as ive said time and again it leads to sad results i didnt want to be a giant protested glew not at first anyway i thought once i should be a famous warrior i joined the host of lord goryon when he marched against lord gast but i couldnt stand the sight of blood it turned me green green as grass and those battles enough to make your head swim all that clashing and smiting the din alone is more than flesh can bear no no it was absolutely out of the question a warriors life is one of hardship taran said and it takes a stout heart to follow it surely there were other means to make a name for yourself i thought then i might become a bard glew went on it turned out as badly the knowledge you must gain the lore to be learned im with you there old fellow murmured fflewddur with a sigh of regret i had rather the same experience it wasnt the years of study explained glew in a voice that would have been forlorn had it not been so loud i know i could have learned if id taken the time no it was my feet i couldnt bear all the tramping and wandering around from one end of prydain to the other and always sleeping in a different place and the change of water and the harp rubbing blisters on your shoulder we grieve for you interrupted taran shifting restlessly but we can not tarry here glew had crouched down in front of the companions and taran tried desperately to think of the best means of getting past him please please dont go cried glew as if reading tarans thoughts his eyes blinking frantically not yet ill show you a passage in a moment i promise yes yes shouted gurgi at last able to bring himself to open his eyes and clamber to his feet gurgi does not like caverns and his poor tender head is filled with soundings and poundings it was then i decided to become a hero glew eagerly went on ignoring the impatience of the companions to go about slaying dragons and such but you cant imagine how difficult it is why even finding a dragon is almost impossible but i discovered one in cantrev mawr it was a small dragon admitted glew about the size of a weasel the cottagers had it penned up in a rabbit hutch and the children used to go and look at it when theyd nothing else to do but it was a dragon nevertheless i would have slain it he added with a huge rattling sigh i tried but the vicious thing bit me i still carry the marks taran tightened his grip on his sword glew he said firmly i beg you once again to show us the passage if you will not then i thought i might become a king glew said hurriedly before taran could finish i thought if i could wed a princess but no they turned me away at the castle gate what else could i do moaned glew shaking his head miserably what was left for me but to try enchantments at last i came upon a wizard who claimed to have a book of spells in his possession he wouldnt tell me how it had fallen into his hands but he assured me the magic it held was most powerful it had once belonged to the house of llyr taran caught his breath at these words eilonwy is a princess of the house of llyr he whispered to the bard what tale is glew telling us is he speaking the truth it had come glees went on from caer colur itself naturally i glew tell me quickly taran cried what is caer colur what has it to do with the house of llyr why everything replied glew as though surprised at tarans asking caer colur is the ancient seat of the house of llyr i should think everyone would know that a very treasure house of charms and enchantments oh my yes so as i was saying naturally i believed i had at last found something to help me the wizard was eager to be rid of the book as eager as i was to have it tarans hands had suddenly begun to tremble where is caer colur he asked how can we find it find it said glew i dont know if theres much left of it to find they say the castle has been in ruins for years bewitched too as you might expect and you should have some hard rowing to do rowing overland said fflewddur dont ask us to believe that rowing repeated glew nodding sorrowfully long ago caer colur was part of mona but it broke from the mainland during a flood now its no more than a speck of island be that as it may glew went on i took all the little treasure i had managed to save where is the island taran pressed glew you must tell us it is important for us to know at the mouth of the alaw replied glew with a certain vexation at being interrupted once more but that has nothing to do with what happened to me you see the wizard tarans mind raced magg had taken eilonwy to the alaw he had needed a boat was eilonwys ancestral home his destination his glance met fflewddurs and the bards expression showed he had been following the same thought the wizard glew continued was in such haste that i had no chance to see the book until it was too late he had cheated me it was a book a book of nothing of empty pages amazing cried prince rhun the very book we found worthless sighed glew but since you found it you may keep it its yours a gift something to remember me by so you wont forget poor glew small chance of that muttered fflewddur finally i turned to brewing my own potions said glew i wanted to be fierce i wanted to be strong to make all mona tremble oh it was long labor i tell you alas you see the results and the end of all my hopes the giant glumly continued until you came along you must help me escape from this frightful cavern i cant stand the bats and the crawly things its too much i tell you too much its nasty and horrid and sticky and wet he cried in loud despair i cant abide mold and mushrooms mold and mushrooms ive had enough of them he set to weeping again and his pitiful moans shook the cavern dallben my master is the most powerful enchanter in prydain taran said it may be that he can find a means to help you but it is your help we need now the sooner we are free the sooner i shall return to him too long to wait moaned glew ill be a mushroom myself by that time help us taran pleaded help us and we shall try to help you glew said nothing for a moment his forehead wrinkled and his lips twitched nervously very well very well he sighed climbing to his feet follow me oh theres one thing you might do he added if it would be no bother to you its such a little thing if you really wouldnt mind so at least i might have the satisfaction however brief a tiny favor would you call me king glew great belin shouted fflewddur ill call you king prince or whatever you choose only show us a way out of here sire glews spirits seemed to lift as he shambled toward the dim reaches of the cavern the companions scrambled down the ledge and hastened to keep up with his huge strides glew having spoken to no one since his confinement never left off talking he had he explained tried to brew new potions this time to make himself smaller in one of the chambers he had even set up a kind of workshop where a bubbling pool of steaming hot water served to boil his concoctions glews cleverness in devising makeshift pestles and mortars cookpots and basins from painstakingly hollowedout stones surprised taran and filled him with a pitying admiration for the desperate giant but his mind turned over and over on itself seeking an understanding that escaped him like a willothewisp each time he drew close to it he was certain the answer lay in the ruined halls of caer colur and certain the companions would find eilonwy there impatient to be gone he ran forward as glew halted at a chimneylike shaft of rock close to the ground the dark mouth of a tunnel opened farewell sniffed glew pointing sorrowfully at the tunnel go straight on you shall find your way you have my word taran said while gurgi fflewddur and prince rhun crawled into the opening if it is in dallbens power he will help you clutching the bauble taran bent and thrust his way past the jagged arch bats rose in a shrieking cloud he heard gurgi cry out in fear and raced ahead next moment he collided with a wall of stone and fell back on his heels while the bauble slipped from his grasp and dropped among the pebbles on the uneven ground with a shout taran spun to see a massive rock pushed into the opening and flung himself toward it glew had sealed the passage chapter the tomb the bard like taran had dashed headlong into the wall and now struggled to his feet gurgis yells rang above the screeching of the bats prince rhun stumbled to tarans side and threw his weight against the immovable rock the bauble had rolled into a corner but one glance in the light of the glowing sphere showed taran there was no other way in or out of the chamber glew taran called pushing with all his strength at the blocked passage let us out what have you done while gurgi jabbering furiously beat his fists against the unyielding stone taran plunged against it once more beside him he heard prince rhun gasping with his own efforts fflewddur shoved and heaved mightily lost his footing and sprawled to earth little worm the bard shouted at the top of his voice liar youve betrayed us from the other side of the stone came glews muffled voice im very sorry forgive me but what else am i to do let us out taran demanded again still straining to move the rock with a sob half of anger and half of despair he dropped to earth and scrabbled desperately at the loose pebbles move aside heavy stone evil wicked little giant shouted gurgi take away lockings and blockings or rageful gurgi will smack your great feeble head we would have done you a kindness taran cried and you repay us with treachery i say thats true enough called prince rhun how do you expect anyone to help you if theyre buried in here faint though it was a sobbing sound drifted from beyond the blocked passageway too long moaned the voice of glew too long i can wait no more in this ghastly cave who knows whether dallben would care about my fate very likely he wouldnt it must be done now now glew taran said forcing himself to be as calm and patient as he could for he was convinced the giant had taken leave of his senses there is nothing we alone can do for you or we would have done it before this but there is there is cried glew you shall help with my potions im sure i can brew another to bring me back to size thats all i ask is that too much if you want us to help you cook up more of those dreadful messes you fed llyan called fflewddur youre taking a curious way to win our friendship the bard hesitated and his eyes widened in sudden dismay great belin he murmured as he did with llyan even as the bard spoke tarans legs began to quake for the same thought had occurred to him fflewddur he whispered he is indeed out of his wits this cavern has driven him mad not a bit of it replied the bard it makes excellent sense in a nasty horrible fashion he has no one else to try his concoctions on he pressed to the stone and cupped his hands around his mouth you shant do that you wretched sniveling worm he shouted we wont swallow your evil stews even if you starve us and if you try to cram them down our throats youll learn that a foam can bite i promise pleaded glew you wont have to swallow a thing ill take all the risks myself terrible risks they are too suppose i should turn into a puff of smoke and blow away you never know when youre dealing with such recipes it could happen i wish it would muttered fflewddur no no glew went on this wont hurt you a bit you can be sure it wont take more than a moment of your time half a moment and i shall only need one of you only one you cant say thats asking too much you cant be so selfish glews voice had risen to a frenzy and he had begun shouting and wailing so loudly and rapidly taran could barely make out the words but as he listened taran felt the blood drain from his heart a chill held and shook him as glew babbled on glew he cried despair welling up in him what do you mean to do with us please please try to understand returned glews voice its my only chance im sure it will work ive thought it over carefully ever since ive been in this awful hole i know i can brew the right potion i have all i need except one thing one tiny little ingredient it wont hurt you a bit you wont feel a thing i swear it to you taran gasped in horror you mean to kill one of us there was a long silence finally glews voice reached the companions again it sounded as though glews feelings had been hurt you make it sound so so raw great belin shouted fflewddur let me get my hands on your scrawny neck and ill make you sound raw there was another silence please said glew faintly try to look at it from my side gladly said fflewddur just push away that rock dont think its easy for me glew went on im fond of all of you especially the little fuzzy one and i feel dreadful about the whole thing but theres no chance anyone else will stop down here you do understand that dont you you arent angry id never forgive myself if you were even now he added plaintively i dont know how ill ever bring myself to pick out one of you no no i cant i havent the heart dont ask me to put myself through that torment no you shall decide among you that will be best all around believe me glew continued it will be worse for me than for you but ill shut my eyes so i wont see which one of you it is then after its over well try to forget about it well be the best of good friends those of you remaining that is ill lead you out of here i promise well find llyan oh it will be good to see her again and all will be well dont go away said glew ill get a few things ready i wont keep you waiting glew listen to me called taran this is an evil deed you plan set us free no answer came the rock did not move dig friends cried fflewddur drawing his sword dig for your lives taran and gurgi unsheathed their blades and side by side attacked the ground beneath the ponderous stone with all their strength they thrust into the rocky unyielding earth their swordpoints rang on the pebbles but try as they would they could barely scrape away more than a shallow hole prince khun sought to force his sword under the rock but succeeded only in snapping the point off the blade taran picked up the bauble bending to hands and knees he scanned every portion of this prison hoping to find some crack or tiny opening the companions could enlarge the walls rose sheer and unbroken he has trapped us well said taran sinking to the ground there is but one way out the way glew offers us as i consider it said rhun he asked for only one of us that would leave three to keep searching for the princess taran was thoughtful for a moment for the first time he said bitterly i believed i had guessed where magg meant to bring eilonwy to caer colur it is the strongest clue we have gained now it is useless to us useless said rhun not at all we need only do as glew suggests and the others can be on their way do you expect that feeble worm to keep his word fflewddur asked angrily i would trust him every bit as much as i would trust magg nevertheless said rhun we cant be sure until we try the companions fell silent at the prince of monas words gurgi who had crouched on the earth and wrapped his woolly arms around his knees stared wretchedly at taran gurgi will go the creature whispered faintly though he trembled so much he could hardly speak yes yes he will give his poor tender head for broilings and boilings valiant gurgi murmured taran indeed i know you would give up your poor tender head he patted the frightened gurgi but there is no question of that we must stand together if glew wants a life he shall pay dearly for it fflewddur once more began digging and chipping at the rock i agree with you entirely he said we must stand as one to the extent that we have any choice at all as soon as the little fellow comes back oh drat and blast i dont know why i keep thinking of him as a little fellow except that he impresses me that way no matter what his size hell surely seize one of us he hasnt the honor of a flea or the heart of a gnat and hes desperate if we fight him theres a good chance all of us shall be slain you can not mean we should take glews bargain said taran certainly not replied fflewddur i shall stand sword in hand and smite the little fellow about the knees since i cant reach his head i only mean to point out the risks as far as his ridiculous idea of having us choose among ourselves is concerned i dont think it even worth a thought i do said prince rhun taran turned in surprise to rhun not fully understanding his words the prince of mona grinned at him almost shyly its the only thing that will satisfy glew said rhun and for that i think its a very cheap bargain no life can be so cheaply held taran began im afraid youre wrong answered rhun he smiled and shook his head ive thought a great deal about this since weve been in the cavern and theres no sense not facing facts i i dont see that ive been any help whatever on the contrary ive brought nothing but ill luck not that i meant to but it seems thats the way of it with me so if any one of us can be dispensed with why i should have to say that person is myself its true rhun quickly went on disregarding tarans cry of protest im delighted to be of some use for once especially if it will help eilonwy i assure you i wont mind in the slightest as glew says it will only take a moment theres not one of you who wouldnt give up his life for a companion rhun added fflewddur fflam offered his life for ours in llyans lair even now poor gurgi is willing to offer his he raised his head a bard a humble creature of the forest an assistant pigkeeper rhuns eyes met tarans and in a low voice he said can a prince do less i doubt i should ever really be able to measure up to being a true prince except in this taran looked at rhun for a long moment you speak of measure he said i had measured you as no more than a feckless princeling i was wrong you are a truer prince and better man than ever i believed but this sacrifice is not yours to make you know my oath to your father prince rhun grinned again indeed a heavy oath he said very well i shall lift it from you i say he added its astonishing but i wonder what became of all the bats chapter the ladder why theyre gone taran quickly flashed the golden light about the chamber every one of them yes yes gurgi cried no more shriekings and squeakings i cant say im unhappy about it added the bard i get along well enough with mice and ive always been fond of birds but when you put the two together id just as soon avoid them the bats may prove our best friends and surest guides taran said rhun has struck on something the bats have found a way out if we can only discover it we can follow them quite so answered the bard making a wry face first thing would be to turn into bats ourselves then i daresay we should have no difficulties taran strode hurriedly from one end of the chamber to the other he played the baubles light over the walls sending the beams upward to the sloping ceiling of rock scanning each crevice and outcropping but saw only a few shallow niches from which some ancient stone had fallen again and again he swept the golden light around the cave a fair shadowy line seemed traced amid the stones high above him he stepped back and studied it carefully the shadow deepened and taran realized it marked a narrow ledge a flaw in the rock there it is he called holding the bauble as steadily as his trembling hands allowed there you can barely make it out the wall curves and hides it but see where the rock seems to dip and break amazing cried rhun astonishing its a passage rightly enough the bats have gone through it do you think we can setting the golden sphere on the ground taran strode to the rock face and sought to raise himself by grasping the slight ripples of stone but the wall was too sheer his hands slipped clutched vainly for support and he fell back before he had been able to climb his own height gurgi too attempted to scale the smooth surface for all his agility he did little better than taran and he sank down puffing and moaning just as i said glumly remarked fflewddur all we need is a few pairs of wings taran had not ceased to stare at the high passageway taunting him with the promise of freedom beyond his reach we can not climb the wall he said frowning but there may still be hope his eyes turned from the distant ledge to the companions then back again a rope would not help us even if we had one there is no means of securing it but a ladder exactly what we need said fflewddur but unless youre prepared to build one on the spot we shouldnt waste our time grieving over something we dont have we can build a ladder taran said quietly yes i should have seen it at once what what cried the bard a fflam is clever but youre going far beyond me we can do it replied taran and need seek no further we ourselves are the ladder great belin shouted fflewddur clapping his hands of course yes we shall climb on each others shoulders he ran to the wall and measured it with a glance still too high he said shaking his head even the topmost man would reach it with little to spare but he would reach it nevertheless insisted taran it is our only escape his only escape corrected the bard whoever climbs out will shorten our ladder by that much our choice is hardly better than what glew gave us he added only one of us can save himself taran nodded it may be that he can drop a vine down to the others he said in that way he stopped glews voice filtered into the chamber is all well in there called the giant its going splendidly out here ive made everything ready i hope youre not too upset would one of you mind stepping forward dont tell me which i dont want to know im as sorry as you are taran turned quickly to the prince of mona i know their hearts and i speak for my companions our choice is taken it is too late to hope to save us try to make your way to caer colur should kaw find you he will guide you there i dont intend leaving anyone behind replied rhun if this is your choice it is not mine i shall not prince rhun riaran said firmly did you not put yourself under my orders the stone had begun to grate in the passageway and taran could hear glews frantic snuffling this too you must take he said pressing the bauble into rhuns reluctant hand it is rightfully eilonwys and it is you who shall give it back to her he turned his eyes away may it shine brightly on your wedding day gurgi had clambered to the shoulders of the bard who braced himself against the wall rhun still hesitated taran seized him by the collar of his jacket and dragged him forward taran climbed to fflewddurs back then to gurgis the human ladder swayed dangerously under the weight of the companions the bard cried for rhun to hurry taran felt rhuns hands grasp at him then slip from below came gurgis labored breathing taran clutched rhuns belt and heaved upward as one knee then the other was thrust upon his shoulders the passage is too far gasped rhun stand up taran cried steady youre nearly there with a last effort he forced himself to rise as high as he could rhun scrabbled at the ledge suddenly tarans burden was lifted farewell prince of mona he called as rhun swung himself to the narrow outcropping and plunged into the passage fflewddur cried a warning and taran felt himself falling dazed and breathless on the stones he tried to regain his feet it was utterly dark he staggered against the bard who pulled him from what taran realized was the entry to the chamber a rush of chill air told taran that glew had pushed the rock aside and he sensed rather than saw a darker shadow thrust into the opening taran unsheathed his blade and swung it wildly it struck something solid ah ow cried glew you mustnt do that the arm pulled back suddenly taran heard fflewddur draw his blade gurgi had scuttled to tarans side and was throwing stones as fast as he could pick them up we must stand against him now taran cried we shall see whether hes as great a coward as he is a liar hurry give him no chance to shut us in again swords raised the companions flung themselves out of the chamber somewhere taran knew glew towered above them but in the blackness he dared not strike with his weapon fearful of harming gurgi or fflewddur stumbling along next to him youre spoiling it all wailed glew i shall have to catch one of you myself why are you making me do this i thought you understood i thought you wanted to help me wind whistled over tarans head as glew snatched at him he threw himself down among the sharp rocks to one side he heard fflewddur shout great belin the little monster can see better in the dark than we can until now the companions had clung together but tarans sudden movement had torn him away from the others he groped to rejoin them and at the same time to escape glews frantic lunges he tumbled against a pile of stones that gave way with a clatter and went sliding into a stream of noisome liquid glew wailed in resounding despair now youve done it you ve upset my potions stop it stop it youre making a mess of everything what must have been glews foot came stamping down nearly on top of him as taran lashed out with his sword the blade rebounded in his hand but glew yelled horribly above taran an almost invisible shadow seemed to be hopping on one leg the bard was right taran thought in terror the greatest risk from glew lay in being trampled the ground shook under the giants feet and taran leaped blindly from the sound next thing he knew he fell with a splash into one of the pools dotting the cavern he thrashed wildly and flung out his arms seeking a handhold on the rocky edge the water glittered with a cold pale light as taran scrambled out bright luminous droplets clung to his drenched garments his face hands and hair escape for him was hopeless now the glow would betray him wherever he sought refuge run taran shouted to the companions let glew follow me in one stride the giant was at the pool by the light of his own dripping body taran could make out the huge shape he thrust forward with his blade the eager hand of glew brushed it aside please please i beg you cried glew dont make things worse than they are even now i shall have to boil my potion again have you no consideration no thought for anyone else the giant reached to seize him taran raised his sword high above his head in a last futile gesture of defense golden rays burst around him brilliant as noonday with a scream of pain glew clapped his hands to his eyes the light he shrieked stop the light screaming and roaring the giant covered his head with his arms his earsplitting bellows rang through the cave the stone icicles trembled and crashed to earth the crystals split and showered taran with fragments suddenly glew was no longer standing but stretched full length half covered by the shards lying motionless where a falling crystal had glanced off his head taran still dazzled leaped to his feet at the entrance to the chamber stood prince rhun the bauble blazing in his hand chapter the empty book hullo hullo called rhun hastening to the companions ive never been so surprised in my life i didnt mean to disobey orders but after id crawled out the passage i i just couldnt leave you there to be cooked up i simply couldnt do it i kept thinking to myself that none of you would have gone running off he hesitated and looked anxiously at taran you arent angry are you you saved our lives replied taran he clasped rhuns hand i only reproach you for risking your own joy and happiness cried gurgi poor tender head is spared from stampings and trampings and kind master is safe from brewings and stewings but the most amazing thing was the bauble prince rhun went on beaming proudly the light didnt go out even after id got hold of it astonishing he stared curiously at the golden sphere whose rays had already begun to dim and handed it back to taran i dont know what happened it suddenly started getting bright and brighter all of itself unbelievable its the one thing that stopped him said fflewddur hands on hips the bard was looking down at the prostrate form of glew hed been here so long he couldnt stand the brightness the repulsive little grub there im calling him little again he added but l still say for a giant hes remarkably smallnatured he knelt and peered at glews face hes had a good crack on the head but hes still alive fflewddur put a hand to his sword we might be wise to ah make sure he doesnt wake up leave him said taran staying fflewddurs arm i know he tried to do us ill but i still pity the wretched creature and mean to ask dallben if he can help him very well said fflewddur with some reluctance he wouldnt have done as much for us but a fflam is merciful quick now lets be off how did you climb down taran asked rhun did you find vines long enough to reach us prince rhuns jaw dropped and he blinked with alarm i im afraid ive done it again he murmured i didnt climb i jumped i somehow never thought of getting out again surprising it simply never occurred to me im sorry ive put us right back where we were not quite replied taran to the despondent prince we can hoist you up as we did before and this time you can lower something for the rest of us but we must make haste theres no need for us to stand on each others heads fflewddur suddenly cried i see an easier way look there he pointed upward to where a large crack yawned in the cavern wall a shaft of sunlight fell over the stones and fresh air whistled through the crevice we can thank glew for that with all his roaring and screaming hes shaken the rocks loose we shall be out in no time bless the repulsive little monster he said he wanted to make mona tremble he added and great belin so he did after a fashion the companions hurried to the wall of the cave and began picking their way through the rubble of broken stones prince rhun however halted abruptly and began fumbling with his jacket i say thats surprising he cried i know i put it there with an anxious frown he began searching his garments once again hurry taran called we dare not be here when glew comes to his senses what are you looking for my book answered rhun where can it be it must have fallen out while i was crawling through that hole or perhaps leave it taran urged it is worthless youve risked your life once dont risk it again for a book of empty pages it was a handsome keepsake said rhun and would be useful it cant be far go ahead ill join you i shant be a moment he turned and trotted back toward the tunnel rhun taran shouted racing after him the prince of mona disappeared into the chamber taran found him on hands and knees groping over the rough floor splendid cried rhun glancing over his shoulder a little light is what i needed now surely its bound to be here let me see first where i was climbing up if it dropped out then by all rights it should be close to the wall taran was determined if need be to lay hold of the prince and drag him bodily from the cell which had so nearly become a tomb he strode forward just as rhun gave a cry of triumph and there it is shouted the prince he picked up the book and carefully examined it i hope it isnt damaged he remarked all that scrambling about might have torn the pages no it seems he stopped and shook his head in dismay i say that is a shame its ruined all covered with scratchings and markings whatever could have happened he put the leatherbound volume into tarans hand look he said what a pity every page is marred its really useless now taran was about to cast the book aside and carry out his first intention of collaring the prince but his eyes widened at the sight of the pages rhun he whispered these are more than scratchings it is carefully written i had thought the pages empty so had i said rhun what could fflewddur called out urging them to hasten taran and prince rhun left the chamber gurgi had already reached the opening in the cavern ceiling and was beckoning to them the book we found in glews hut taran began dont worry about glews property worry about glew said fflewddur hes beginning to stir move along or well still end up in one of his potions the sun had just risen but it was bright and warming after the dank cavern the companions gratefully breathed the fresh springtime air gurgi shouted joyfully and raced on ahead he soon returned with good tidings the river lay not too far away the companions set out for it with all speed as they strode along taran held up the volume to fflewddur there is deep mystery in this i can not read the writing the script is ancient but how it came there after what weve been through replied the bard glancing at the pages i can understand your wanting to jest but this is hardly the moment for it jest i do not jest taran started as he pointed at the volume again the pages were empty as they had always been the writing he stammered its gone my friend said the bard gently your eyes have played you false at the river well put pool cloths on your head and youll feel much better its quite understandable considering the darkness the shock of nearly being boiled i know what i have seen taran protested even in the cavern even in the dim light of the bauble its true put in rhun who had been following their talk i saw it myself theres no mistake the bauble was shining straight on the pages the bauble taran cried wait can it be hurriedly he drew out the sphere while the companions halted and watched him silently as the light blossomed in his hand taran held it so that its rays bathed the pages in a golden glow the writing sprang into sight sharp and clear astonishing cried rhun the most amazing thing ive seen in my life taran crouched on the turf held the bauble close to the book and with trembling fingers turned leaf after leaf the curious tracing crowded every page the bard gave along low whistle what does this mean fflewddur taran asked he raised his head and looked with concern at the bard the bards face had paled what it means in my opinion said fflewddur is that we should get rid of the book instantly drop it in the river i regret to say i cant read it i could never manage to learn all these secret scripts and ancient letters but i recognize enchantment when i see it he shuddered and turned away id rather not even look at it if you dont mind not that it frightens me yes it makes me feel acutely uneasy and you know my views on meddling if glew spoke the truth it comes from a place of enchantments taran said but what can it tell us i shall not destroy it he added returning the book to his jacket i cant explain i feel as though id touched a secret its strange like a moth that brushes your hand and flutters away again ahem said fflewddur casting a nervous glance at taran if you insist on carrying the thing with you would you oblige me nothing personal you understand but i would appreciate it if youd stay a few paces away midday was long past when the companions reached the riverbank but they rejoiced at their good fortune the remains of the raft were still there they set to work hastily to repair it prince rhun in better spirits than ever labored unstintingly for a time taran had forgotten the prince of mona was to be eilonwys betrothed now the sad thought returned to him as he helped rhun knot new vines around the raft you should be proud of yourself taran said quietly did you seek to prove yourself a true prince you have done so rhun son of rhuddlum why perhaps thats so replied rhun as though the idea had never occurred to him but its a curious thing it doesnt seem one bit as important as it did astonishing but true the sun had begun to dip by the time the raft was ready taran who had grown more and more restless as the day waned urged the companions to press on rather than wait the night on shore and they clambered aboard twilight soon fell over the valley and the alaw ran in swift silver ripples under the rising moon the shore lay silent flanked by brooding hills in the middle of the raft gurgi curled up like a muddy ball of leaves beside him the prince of mona slept and snored peacefully a smile of contentment on his round face taking the first watch taran and fflewddur guided the awkward craft as it rapidly floated seaward they spoke little fflewddur had not entirely lost his disquiet over the strange book tarans thoughts were for the morrow which he hoped would bring the companions closer to the end of their search once again fear and doubt made him wonder if he had chosen wisely even if eilonwy had been taken to caer colur he had no cause to believe magg or achren still held her there so little was known for certain the book and its meaning even the nature of eilonwys bauble were more riddles added to so many others why he murmured why is the writing clear only when the bauble shines on it and why did it light for rhun when it had never done so before why did it light for me for that matter as a bard answered fflewddur i know a great deal about these enchanted devices and i can tell you at the narrow end of the harp a string tinkled as it snapped in two ah yes said fflewddur the fact is i know very little about them eilonwy of course has the gift of making it light when she pleases shes half an enchantress you know and the bauble does belong to her for someone else i wonder and im only guessing mind you i wonder if it might have to do with how shall i put it not even thinking about it or about yourself what i mean fflewddur went on in the cavern when i tried to make it light i was saying to myself if i can do this if i can find the way for us perhaps taran said quietly watching the moonwhite riverbank slip past them perhaps you have the truth of it at first i felt as you did then i remember thinking of eilonwy only of her and the bauble showed its light prince rhun was ready to lay down his life his thoughts were for our safety not at all for his own and because he offered the greatest sacrifice the bauble glowed brightest for him can that be its secret to think more for others than ourselves that would seem to be one of its secrets at least replied fflewddur once youve discovered that youve discovered a great secret indeed with or without the bauble the hills had flattened and given way to low fields of sedge a scent of brine and brackish water reached tarans nostrils ahead the river widened flowing into a bay and beyond that to an even greater expanse of water to his right on the far side of towering rocks taran heard the rush of surf reluctantly he decided they dared go no farther until dawn while fflewddur roused gurgi and prince rhun taran poled the rafter shore the companions settled themselves amid a tall clump of reeds and gurgi opened his wallet of food taran still restless walked to a hillock and peered toward the sea keep to the shadows said the voice of gwydion achrens eyes are sharp chapter the island the prince of don rose like a shadow from the sedge though he had discarded his headcloth and tools he still wore the shabby raiment of his disguise perched on gwydions shoulder kaw blinked and ruffled his feathers indignant at being awakened seeing taran however he bobbed his head and began croaking with excitement taran startled cried out prince rhun waving his sword with great vigor and making as fierce a face as he could hastened to join taran why it looks like the shoemaker rhun called lowering his weapon as he caught sight of the tall figure is it indeed whatever have you done with those sandals you promised alas prince rhun gwydion replied your sandals must wait on other matters this is no shoemaker but gwydion prince of don taran hurriedly whispered gurgi and fflewddur had now run up the bards jaw dropped great belin stammered fflewddur to think we shared a stable at dinas rhydnant lord gwydion had you only made yourself known to me forgive me for deceiving you answered gwydion i dared not do otherwise silence then was my best shield i would have sought you at dinas rhydnant taran said but magg gave us no time he has stolen away eilonwy we have been told of a place called caer colur where he might have taken her and have been trying to make our way there thanks to kaw i know a little of what has befallen you gwydion said he told me you had chosen to follow the river he lost you when llyan pursued him but found me here achren too sought caer colur gwydion went on quickly when i learned this i strove to follow her ship one of the fisherfolk sailed with me to the northern coast your island people are bold he added glancing at rhun remember them with honor when you shall be king of mona the fisherman would have brought me to caer colur itself this favor i could not accept for i dared not reveal my mission to him yet before he returned to mona haven he willingly gave me the small boat he carried aboard and would take no reward for his risk or his generosity have you already gone to caer colur taran asked was there any trace of eilonwy gwydion nodded yes but i have failed to save the princess he said heavily she is achrens prisoner magg moved more swiftly than any of us the spider cried the bard with such heat that kaw started up in alarm the sneering sneaking spider i beg you let me deal with him he and i have a long score to settle and it grows longer every moment he raised his sword i shant need this when i find him ill squash him with my bare hands hold hold ordered gwydion spider he may be but his sting is all the more deadly his vanity and ambition have made him achrens willing creature he shall be dealt with and so shall achren our concern now is for eilonwy can we not free her taran asked how closely is she guarded last night i rowed to the island gwydion said in the little time i remained there i could not discover where the princess is held though i saw that achren has but a paltry company of warriors hirelings and outlaws who have cast their lot with her none of arawns deathless cauldronborn is among them he smiled bitterly without the protection of the lord of annuvin haughty achren commands only lackeys then we can attack them now taran cried his hand on his sword we are enough to overcome them this task calls for strength of a different nature and swords are not all we shall have to fear gwydion replied there is much i have not told you of this matter and much that i myself did not know even now the riddle is not fully answered but i have learned that achrens plans are deeper than i had imagined and eilonwys plight graver she must be taken from caer colur before it is too late gwydion drew his cloak around him and stepped toward the riverbank taran caught his arm let us go with you he urged we shall stand with you should you need us and guard eilonwys escape the tall warrior paused and glanced at the waiting companions he turned his greenflecked eyes on taran and studied him closely i do not doubt the courage of any one of you but caer colur holds greater peril than you know eilonwy is dear to me to all of us taran said gwydion was silent a moment his weathered face grim and withdrawn then he nodded it shall be as you wish follow me the prince of don led the companions from the marshy fields to a narrow shoulder of beach from there they passed along the edge of the sea to a sheltered cove where a small boat bobbed at the end of a mooring line gwydion beckoned the companions to step aboard took the oars and with swift noiseless strokes guided the little craft seaward as the glittering black water rolled beneath him taran crouched in the bow of the boat and strained his eyes for a sign of caer colur prince rhun and the companions huddled at the stern while gwydion bent his powerful shoulders to the oars the stars had begun to fade and banks of sea mist drifted in chill clouds our task must be finished quickly and before daylight said gwydion most of achrens warriors have been set to guard the landward entry we shall land on the far side of the castle hard by the outer wall in darkness we may escape their eyes glew told us caer colur had broken from the mainland said taran but i had not imagined it to be this far at sea gwydion frowned glew kaw said nothing to me of glew it was then that kaw left us taran explained small wonder he could not find us again for we were deep underground he told gwydion finding eilonwys bauble the treachery of glew and the strange book gwydion who had been listening intently shipped the oars and let the boat drift alas that you did not speak of this sooner i would have found better means of safeguarding it he said as taran handed him the golden sphere which began to glow brightly gwydion spread his cloak and shielded the light quickly he took the book from tarans hands opened it and brought the bauble closer to the empty pages the ancient writing sprang into sight gwydions face was tense and pale to read this is beyond my power gwydion said but i recognize it for what it is the greatest treasure of the house of llyr a treasure of llyr taran whispered what is its nature does it belong to eilonwy gwydion nodded she is the last princess of llyr and it is hers by bloodright but there is more you must understand for generations the daughters of the house of llyr were among the most skillful enchantresses in prydain using their powers with wisdom and kindliness in their fastness at caer colur were stored all their treasures magical devices and charmed implements whose nature even i do not know the chronicles of the house of llyr give only veiled hints as to how these mysteries were guarded the lore tells of an enchantment known only as the golden pelydryn handed down from mother to daughter and of a book holding all the secrets of those magical devices and many potent spells but caer colur was abandoned and fell into ruins after angharad daughter of regat fled the castle to marry against her mothers wishes the book of spells which she carried away with her was believed lost of the golden pelydryn nothing was known gwydion looked down at the bauble the golden pelydryn was not lost what better way to hide it than to put it as a shining toy in the hands of a child eilonwy believed she had been sent to live with achren and study to be an enchantress gwydion went on it is not true achren stole eilonwy and brought her as a child to spiral castle did achren fail to recognize the golden pelydryn taran asked if she knew its nature why did she leave it in eilonwys possession achren dared not do otherwise answered gwydion yes she knew eilonwys heritage she recognized the pelydryn but also knew it would lose its power if taken forcibly from its rightful owner then too the book of spells had vanished achren could attempt nothing until it was found again and without even realizing it taran said glew was the one who gained the book of spells poor foolish creature who thought himself cheated so he was replied gwydion he could not have seen the hidden writing without the light of the golden pelydryn even then it would have availed him nothing the spells obey only a daughter of the house of llyr eilonwy alone has the inborn skill to read them though not before she herself has reached the threshold of wodianhood she stands there now and the spells of caer colur are within her grasp for that reason has achren sought her so desperately eilonwy is safe then taran cried if she alone can awaken the spells achren dares not harm her nor does achren dare harm us since the pelydryn and the book of enchantments are in our hands it may be gwydion answered grimly that eilonwy is in greater danger than before carefully gwydion placed the book and golden sphere in his jacket and redoubled his efforts at the oars taran clinging to the side of the boat saw a high dark mound loom ahead gwydion swung the craft farther seaward and now rowed steadily in a wide halfcircle the sea swell lifted the little vessel and drove it with evergrowing speed the crash of waves rang in tarans ears gwydion bent his strength to one oar then the other and gurgi whimpered plaintively as the boat was flung forward into a narrow foamfilled channel the pinnacles of caer colur rose black against a dark sky mist rolled around the columns of stone which had been taran guessed proud and lofty towers but were now crumbled and jutting ruins thrusting upward like the shards of broken swords as they came closer he saw the heavy ironbound portals reminders of a day when caer colur had been a fortress rooted on the mainland the gates faced the sea but since the castle had sunk lower they stood halfsubmerged in the restless water waves churned arid beat against them as though to take the ruins by storm and wreak their last destruction near the massive portals wind and water had gouged a cavelike hollow and here gwydion moored the boat and gestured for the companions to disembark as they clambered to the rocks taran heard a tormented groaning and creaking from the gates as though they had gained their own voice and cried out against the onslaught of the waves gwydion climbed upward finding a handhold among the sharp stones rhun painfully toiled after him with taran and gurgi following to catch the prince of mona should he fall fflewddur struggled along silently kaw had already flown to the walls and taran envied the crow his wings as he saw the sheer facing of stone and the broken parapets brooding high above gwydion led them along the base of the wall toward the heavy lintels of the gates the bastion was cleft as though by a sword stroke and loose rubble had fallen into the breach the prince of don signaled them to halt remain here he ordered in a low voice i shall go first and learn where achrens guards are posted noiselessly he vanished into the cleft the companions crouched among the rocks not daring to speak taran rested his head on his arms his thoughts turned again and again to eilonwy and to the words of gwydion he could barely bring himself to believe the slender laughing girl could command powers perhaps as strong as those of achren soon soon he told himself eilonwy would be free but as his impatience grew so did his fear and he looked up anxiously straining eyes and ears for a sign of gwydion he was tempted then to follow the prince of don but in another moment gwydion appeared from the shadows achren pays for a poor vigil gwydion said with a hard smile one sentinel watches landward another leans drowsing on his sword the others sleep the companions pressed through the cleft the task now was to discover eilonwys prison and tarans heart sank within the walls the ruins of caer colur stretched like a great skeleton its tumble of once regal halls and towers lay before the companions and taran glanced with dismay at gwydion the tall warrior motioned for the companions to draw their swords and indicated where each of them was to search fflewddur was about to move toward the outlying buildings when taran nearly cried aloud kaw fluttered from one of the towers and swooped down to perch on tarans upraised arm the crow beat his wings flew aloft once more and circled the pinnacle hes found her taran whispered our search is over it has only now begun warned gwydion one of us shall climb up and see if it is possible to free her the others shall take positions farther along the wall to guard against surprise by achrens warriors i shall taran began then hesitated and turned to prince rhun he bowed his head she will be your betrothed it was your wish that you that i should prove my valor to the princess yes rhun said slowly but it is my wish no longer im quite content proving it to myself and i rather guess you might really be the one eilonwy would prefer to see first taran glanced at gwydion who nodded and directed the others to move to the landward side of the castle as rhun went to join gurgi and fflewddur gwydion knelt and drew the book and golden sphere from his jacket if aught should go amiss these must not fall into achrens hands he said setting the objects carefully beneath the loose stones deftly he replaced the rubble and smoothed the earth around it this must serve to guard them until we return kaw had flown back to taran gwydion rose and from his belt took a coil of slender rope made a loop on the end and held it out to kaw murmuring softly to the crow the bird snatched the line with his beak and flapped silently to the jagged pinnacle hovered above a jutting stone then dropped the loop securely over it gwydion turned to taran i know what is in your heart he said gently climb up assistant pigkeeper i leave this task to you taran raced to the bottom of the tower the rope pulled taut under his weight and the mist swirled about him as he sought a foothold in the rough wall he tightened his grip on the cord and drew himself upward a sharp gust of sea wind buffeted him for an instant he swung free of the tower below the waves dashed against the rocks he dared not look down bur desperately strove to halt the dizzying motion his foot struck stone again bending all his strength to the rope he climbed higher a casement opened just above him and taran hoisted himself to the ledge within the small chamber a rush light burned fitfully his heart leaped eilonwy was there the princess lay motionless on a low couch she still wore the robe teleria had given her though now it was torn and mudspattered the redgold hair tumbled about her shoulders and her face was pale and drawn taran hurriedly swung himself over the ledge dropped to the flagstones and hastened to eilonwys side he touched her shoulder the girl stirred turned her face away and murmured in her sleep quickly taran whispered gwydion waits for us eilonwy roused passed a hand over her forehead and opened her eyes at the sight of taran she gave a cry of surprise gurgi is here too taran said fflewddur prince rhun all of us you are safe hurry thats very interesting said eilonwy sleepily but who are they and for the matter of that she added who are you chapter a meeting of strangers i am eilonwy daughter of angharad daughter of regat continued eilonwy putting her hand to the silver crescent at her throat but who are you she repeated i havent the least idea in the world what youre talking about wake up faran cried shaking her youre dreaming why yes as a matter of fact i was eilonwy answered with a vague and sleepy smile but how did you guess i dont believe dreaming actually shows when youre doing it she paused frowning or does it sometime i shall haveto find out the only way i suppose is to look at myself when im asleep and how i might go about that i cant imagine her voice faltered and trailed away she seemed suddenly to forget taran was even there and sank back to the couch difficult difficult she murmured like trying to turn yourself inside out or would it be outside in eilonwy look at me taran tried to raise her but eilonwy with a little cry of annoyance drew away you must listen taran insisted thats what ive been doing she replied so far youve made no sense whatever i was much more comfortable asleep id rather dream than be shouted at but what was i dreaming a pleasant dream with a pig in it and someone who no its gone now faster than a butterfly youve spoiled it taran had forced the girl to sit upright once more now he stared at her with dread despite her travelstained garments and disheveled hair she appeared unharmed but her eyes were strangely depthless it was not sleep that filled her and his hands trembled as he realized eilonwy had been drugged or his heart chilled at the thought of it bewitched listen carefully he pleaded there is no time i dont believe people should be allowed to come stamping into other peoples dreams without asking first eilonwy said with some vexation theres something impolite about it like walking into a spider web when the spiders still using it taran ran to the casement he could see nothing of the companions below nor any sign of kaw the moon was down and the sky would soon lighten quickly he turned back to eilonwy make haste i beg you he cried climb down with me the rope is strong enough for both of us a rope exclaimed eilonwy me go sliding down with you ive only known you these few moments but it seems to me you make the silliest suggestions no thank you she stifled a yawn you might try sliding down the rope yourself she added with a certain sharpness and let me go back to sleep i hope i can remember where i left off thats the worst of having your dream broken into you can never find it again taran sick with alarm knelt beside her what holds you he whispered fight against it can you not remember me taran assistant pigkeeper how interesting remarked eilonwy sometime you must tell me more about yourself but not now think taran urged remember caer dallben coll hen wen through the casement the sea wind carried trails of mist like tangled wines taran spoke the names again and the names of the companions eilonwys glance was so distant that she herself seemed far from the chamber caer dallben she murmured how curious i think that might have been part of my dream too there was an orchard the trees were in blossom i was climbing up as high as i could go yes so it was taran pressed eagerly i too remember the day you said youd climb to the very top of the apple tree i warned you not to but you did anyway i wanted to learn the trees eilonwy went on you must learn them anew every year she said for they are always different and in the dream id gone to the last branch it was no dream taran urged but the life you know your own life not a shadow that vanishes in the sun indeed you went to the highest branch it snapped as i feared it would how should anyone know someone elses dream said eilonwy as though speaking to herself yes it broke and i was falling there was someone below who caught me could it have been an assistant pigkeeper i wonder what became of him he is here now taran said quietly he has long sought you and in ways even he himself did not know now that he has found you can you not find your path back to him eilonwy rose to her feet her eyes flickered and for the first time a light shone in them taran held out his hands to her she hesitated then took a step forward but even as she moved to him her glance turned shallow and the light died it is a dream no more than that she whispered and turned away achren has done this to you taran cried she will harm you no longer he seized the girls arm and drew her toward the casement at the sound of achrens name eilonwy stiffened and tore herself from him she spun to face him you dare touch a princess of the house of llyr her voice was sharp her eyes had lost their warmth and taran saw the brief moment of recollection had fled he knew that eilonwy at all costs must be taken from this dread place his terror and dismay grew with the thought that perhaps even now she was beyond hope he struggled to catch her by the waist and put her over his shoulder eilonwy struck him full in the face with such force that he staggered back yet it was not the blow that pained him but her scornful glance on her lips now was a smile of mockery and malice he was a stranger to her and he feared his heart would break once more he tried to seize her eilonwy with a cry of rage twisted away and broke free achren she called achren help me she ran to the portal of the chamber and into the corridor taran snatched up the rush light and raced after the fleeing princess her sandals clattered down the shadowed hallway and he glimpsed an edge of her robe vanishing around a corner she had not ceased to call achrens name in another moment the castle would be roused and the companions discovered taran cursed himself for a blunderer he had no choice now but to overtake the bewitched girl before every hope of escape faded already he heard a shout from the wall and the clash of blades the rush light scorched his hand and he cast it aside in the darkness he sped to the end of the corridor and flung himself down a flight of steps the great hall of caer colur stretched before him the crimson haze of daybreak filling its ruined casements eilonwy fled across the wide stretch of worn and crumbling flagstones and vanished again a hand gripped his jacket and spun him around a torch flared in his eyes the pigkeeper hissed magg the chief steward plucked a dagger from a fold of his garments and thrust at taran who flung up an arm to ward off the blow the dagger glanced aside magg cursed and swept the torch like a sword taran fell back seeking to draw his own weapon the shouts of the awakened guards filled the great hall in another instant he caught sight of gwydion the companions at his heels magg spun around fflewddur had broken away from the press of warriors and was racing at top speed toward the chief steward the bards spiky yellow hair streamed behind him and his face shone with furious triumph the spider is mine cried fflewddur his blade whistling about his head magg at the sight of the frenzied bard yelled in terror and tried to flee the bald was upon him in a moment striking right and left with the flat of his sword in such a wild onslaught that most of his blows missed their mark magg with the strength of desperation sprang at the bards throat and grappled with him before taran could come to fflewddurs aid a warrior with an axe beset him and despite his stout defense taran found himself driven back toward a corner of the hall amid the confusion of the fray he saw gwydion and rhun struggling against other warriors the prince of mona laid about him furiously with his broken sword and it was to one of rhuns sharp blows that tarans assailant fell fflewddur and magg were still locked in combat as taran raced to the side of the bard the dark shaggy form of gurgi overtook him with a yelp of rage gurgi leaped into the air and clung to maggs shoulders the chief steward still wore his silver chain of office gurgi snatched it and let himself swing free magg gasped and tumbled backward choking and hissing while gurgi dangled for an instant then sprang clear of the falling steward in a flash the bard was upon the prostrate magg heedless of the buffeting from maggs flailing legs gurgi laid hold of him by the heels and hung on with all his strength while fflewddur sitting on maggs head seemed indeed to be carrying out his threat of squashing the treacherous chief steward gwydion with dyrnwyn unsheathed and blazing had cut down two warriors who now sprawled motionless on the flagstones terrified at the sight of the flaming weapon the remaining guards fled with long strides gwydion hastened to the companions eilonwy is bewitched taran cried i have lost her gwydions eyes went to the end of the hall where scarlet draperies had been flung back from an alcove eilonwy stood there and beside her achren chapter the spells of caer colur tarans heart froze and within him echoed the nightmare memory of another day when he had stood in terror before achren as if he were still the same frightened lad he had been he trembled once again at the sight of the blackrobed queen her hair unbound fell in glittering silver tresses to her shoulders the beauty of her features had not changed though her face was deathly pale at spiral castle long ago she had been decked in jewels now neither rings nor bracelets adorned her slender hands and white arms but her eyes hard as jewels themselves drew tarans gaze and held it gwydion had sprung forward with a cry taran followed him sword upraised eilonwy shrank back and clung to achren put down your weapons achren commanded the girls life is bound to mine would you take my life then she must share my death seeing the black sword achren had stiffened but made no move to flee instead her lips curled in the shadow of a smile gwydion halted and looked searchingly at her slowly his face dark with anger he returned dyrnwyn to its sheath obey her he murmured to taran i fear achren speaks the truth even in death she may be deadly you show wisdom lord gwydion achren said softly you have not forgotten me nor have i forgotten you i see too the assistant pigkeeper and the foolish bard who should have been food for carrion crows long before this the others perhaps know me not as well as you do but soon they shall unloose the princess eilonwy from your spell said gwydion return her to us and you shall depart unhindered lord gwydion is generous achren replied with a mocking smile you offer me safety when your own peril is greatest you were rash even to set foot on caer colur and now the more hopeless your plight the bolder your words her glance lingered on him pity that one such as you scorned to be my consort and rule with me when the chance was given unloose the girl achren went on no lord gwydion she will serve me as i planned my spells are not the only ones to bind her you know her ancestry and the blood of enchantresses that flows in her veins caer colur itself has long awaited its princess it calls to her and so it ever shall while one stone stands upon the other this is her birthright i do no more than help her claim it you force her to claim it taran burst out eilonwy did not come willingly to caer colur she does not stay willingly his desperation drowned his caution and he could not keep himself from starting toward eilonwy who watched him curiously gwydions hand on his shoulder drew him back is she indeed unwilling achren raised her arm and gestured to the alcove where stood an ancient chest tall as eilonwy herself i have shown her what this contains achren said all the implements of magic treasured up for her power such as she has never known lies within her grasp do you ask her to cast it away let her give you her own answer at achrens words eilonwy raised her head her lips parted but she did not speak hesitating she toyed with the silver chain around her neck hear me princess achren said quickly in a low voice they would deprive you of your heritage of the enchantments that are yours by bloodright i am a princess of llyr eilonwy said coldly i want what is mine who are these who would take it from me i see the one who frightened me in my chamber a keeper of pigs so he claimed the rest i do not know gurgis heartrending wail filled the great hall yes yes you know us oh yes do not speak hurtful words to sad companions you can not forget this is gurgi humble faithful gurgi he waits to serve wise princess as he always did taran turned his face away the grief of the wretched creature pained him even more than his own achren watching eilonwy carefully nodded with satisfaction and their fate achren said to her what shall be the fate of those who seek to despoil the inheritance of a princess eilonwy frowned her eyes strayed over the companions as though perplexed and reluctant she turned to achren they they shall be punished she speaks with your voice taran shouted in anger with your words in her heart she does not wish us ill think you so replied achren taking eilonwys arm and pointing to magg prostrate on the flagstones and firmly in the grasp of the bard princess one of your loyal servants is still captive of these intruders cause him to be released fflewddur sitting astride maggs shoulders took a tighter grip on the scruff of the chief stewards neck magg spat and cursed while the bard shook him furiously your trained spider is my prisoner fflewddur cried he and i have business together long unsettled do you want him back unsquashed then let the princess eilonwy come with us i have no need to bargain achren answered she made a curt gesture to eilonwy the girls face taran saw had taken on a harsh and severe expression she lifted her arm hand outstretched and fingers pointing which shall it be mused achren the illfavored creature who dared call himself your servant gurgi raised his head puzzled and fearful while achren whispered words in a strange language to eilonwy the girls fingers moved slightly guigis eyes widened in surprise and disbelief for an instant he stood unmoving and openmouthed staring at the princess her hand pointing straight at the baffled gurgi suddenly tensed with a sharp cry of pain gurgi stiffened and clutched his head achrens eyes glittered with pleasure again she whispered urgently to eilonwy gurgi shrieked he spun frantically his arms flailing as though to ward off unseen tormentors screaming he flung himself to the ground doubled up and rolled back and forth taran and gwydion raced to his side but the tortured creature like a wounded animal struck at them and thrashed blindly in agony fflewddur leaped to his feet no more he shouted harm gurgi no longer you shall have magg take him at achrens command eilonwy dropped her hand to her side gurgi lay gasping on the stones his body shook with sobbing he raised his shaggy disheveled head and taran saw his face streaming with tears that came not only from the suffering he had just undergone painfully the exhausted creature drew himself up to crouch on hands and knees gurgi crept forward a little way his weeping eyes turned to eilonwy wise princess he murmured it is no wish of hers to fill poor tender head with harmful hurtings gurgi knows this he forgives her magg meantime finding himself free of the bards grasp lost no time in scrambling to his feet and scuttling to the side of achren his encounter with fflewddur had left the chief steward much the worse for wear his handsome garments showed rips and rents his lank hair fell damply over his forehead his chain of office was bent and battered nevertheless once near achren magg folded his arms and haughtily threw back his head rage and hatred filled his eyes and taran was certain that had achren given him the power maggs glance alone would have sufficed to send fflewddur rolling in torments sharper than gurgis you shall pay dearly for this harper magg spat i rejoice that i did not have you thrashed and driven away when fast i laid eyes on youh for now it allows me to hang you in your own harp strings from the highest tower of rhuddlums castle and so shall i do once i am lord of dinas rhydnant lord of dinas rhydnant fflewddur exclaimed a stewards chain is too much honor for you tremble harper sneered magg dinas rhydnant is mine it has been promised me and all the realm king magg magg the magnificent king magg the maggot the bard flung back at him does achren promise you a kingdom a scullery would be more than you deserve achrens promises are false cried taran learn this to your grief magg the blackrobed queen smiled achren knows how to reward those who serve her as she knows how to punish those who defy her maggs kingdom shall stand among the mightiest in the land and caer colur shall rise more glorious than ever its great hall shall be the seat of power over all prydain the lord of annuvin himself shall kneel in homage to me achrens voice fell nearly to a whisper a cold fire burned over her pale features her eyes were no longer on the companions but far beyond them arawn of annuvin shall cower and beg for mercy but his throne shall be toppled it was i achren who showed him the secret ways to power he betrayed me and how he shall suffer my vengeance it was i who ruled prydain before him and none dared question my dominion thus shall it be once more thus shall it be evermore the lore tells of your ancient rule gwydion said sharply and how you sought to keep hearts and minds in thrall to you you tormented those who would not worship you and for those who bowed to you life was little better than a slow death i know too of the blood sacrifices you demanded and your joy at the cries of your victims no achren it shall not come again think you this girl shall lead you to it she will obey me achren replied as surely as if i held her beating heart in my hand gwydions eyes flashed your words are vain achren they can not deceive me do you seek to rule through the princess eilonwy the enchantments she commands still sleep you have not the means to waken them achrens face turned livid and she drew back as though she had been struck you speak beyond your knowledge oh no he doesnt burst out rhun who had been listening in amazement the prince of mona triumphantly faced achren the book the golden light weve got them and we shall never give them up chapter the golden pelydryn prince rhun be silent tarans warning came too late rhun himself realized his blunder and clapped a hand to his mouth his round face filled with dismay and he glanced about him in confusion gwydion stood silently his weathered features tight and pale yet the glance he cast on the unhappy prince of mona was not of reproach but of sorrow prince rhuns shoulders drooped he bowed his head and turned wretchedly away before rhuns outburst while gwydion had been speaking taran had sensed a shadow of fear over achren it had passed now and her lips parted in a subtle smile do you think i wish to hide the truth from you lord gwydion she said i knew the book of spells had vanished from caer colur and i have long sought it the golden pelydryn was cast away or lost by the princess herself indeed to fulfil my plan only these objects are lacking accept my thanks lord gwydion achren went on you spare me the labor of a tedious search spare yourself much pain by putting them in my hands now she commanded harshly give them to me gwydions voice was firm and his words came slowly and carefully it is as the prince of mona says we have found the book of spells and the light that reveals them but it is also as he says you shall never have them shall i not replied achren it is as simple as reaching out they are not in our possession gwydion answered but wellhidden and beyond your grasp that too is easily righted said achren there are means that will cause tongues to be loosened and the deepest secret shouted aloud she glanced at prince rhun the prince of mona speaks even without my urging he shall speak again rhun blinked and swallowed hard but he faced achren stoutly if youre thinking about torturing me he said youre welcome to try it it would be interesting to see how much you could find out since i myself havent the first idea where the pelydryn is he took a deep breath and shut his eyes tightly so there you are go ahead give the harper to me lady achren magg said eagerly while fflewddur bristled and stared defiantly at him he shall sing better to my music than ever he sang with his harp hold your tongue chief steward achren snapped they shall speak willingly enough before i have done with them gwydions hand went to the hilt of the black sword harm none of my companions he cried do so and i vow to strike you down whatever the cost thus do i vow achren flung back seek to defeat me and the girl shall die her voice lowered and so we stand gwydion life against life and death against death which shall you choose if they have taken my bauble said eilonwy drawing closer to achren they must return it it is not fitting for it to remain in the hands of strangers taran could not hold back a cry of sorrow at eilonwys words achren who had been studying the face of each companion turned quickly to him this does not please you assistant pigkeeper she murmured it pains you to be called stranger by her it cuts more cruelly than a knife does it not sharper even than the torments of the wretched creature at your feet she will remain thus because i so command it yet i could give back her memory of you is a golden trinket too high a price or a book of spells that are meaningless to you achren drew closer to taran fixing him with her eyes her voice had dropped to a whisper her words seeming to reach him alone twined around his heart what cares an assistant pigkeeper whether i or another hold sway over prydain lord gwydion himself can not gain for you what you hold dearest indeed he can bring about only her death but i can give you her life yes a gift only i can bestow and more much more achren whispered with me the princess eilonwy shall be a queen but who shall be her king would you have me set her free to wed a witless prince yes magg has told me she is to be given to the son of rhuddlum what then shall be the lot of an assistant pigkeeper to win a princess only to lose her to another are these not your thoughts taran of caer dallben think of this too that achren gives favor for favor achrens eyes pierced him like dagger points and tarans head whirled halfsobbing he tried in vain to stop his ears against the whispered words and buried his face in his hands speak now achrens voice went on the golden pelydryn its hiding place you shall have what you ask for an instant taran thought it was his own voice crying out beyond his will to silence then he gaped in disbelief the words had come from gwydion the prince of don stood with his wolfgray head flung back his eyes blazing and on his face a look of wrath such as taran had never seen before the warriors voice rang harsh and cold through the great hall terrible to hear and taran trembled at the sound of it achren started in a sudden movement you shall have what you ask gwydion cried again the golden pelydryn and the book of spells are buried at the broken wall near the gate where i myself set them achren was silent a moment then her eyes narrowed do you lie to me gwydion she murmured through clenched teeth if it is not true the princess eilonwy will not live beyond this instant they are within your reach gwydion replied shall you hold back from taking them achren made a curt gesture to magg fetch them she ordered the chief steward hastened from the hall and achren turned once more to gwydion beware prince of don she said in a hoarse whisper touch not your sword make no move toward us gwydion did not answer taran and the companions stood motionless and speechless magg had returned to the great hall his sallow face twitched with excitement as he triumphantly bore aloft the golden pelydryn breathless he ran to achrens side so it is he cried they are ours achren snatched the objects from him the golden sphere was dull as lead its beauty gone she held it avidly her eyes glittered and her smile showed the white tips of her sharp teeth for a moment she stood as though reluctant to part with the treasures she had sought then pressed them into eilonwys hands magg was beside himself with impatience and eagerness he gripped his silver chain with clawed fingers while his cheeks trembled and greed lit his beady eyes my kingdom he cried in a tight highpitched voice mine it shall soon be mine achren spun and faced him scornfully silence a kingdom groveling fool be grateful if you are allowed to keep your life maggs jaw dropped and his face turned the color of moldy cheese at the import of achrens words choking as much with terror as with rage he cowered under achrens threatening glance the book of spells lay open in eilonwys outstretched hand she had taken the golden pelydryn and was looking at it curiously in the depths of the golden sphere a tiny light like a whirling blazing snowflake had begun to take shape she frowned and a strange expression came over her face as taran watched horrorstricken eilonwy shuddered violently her head flung from one side to the other as though in pain for an instant her eyes opened wide and she appeared about to speak her voice was no more than a gasp yet in that fleeting moment it seemed to taran she had regained some vague memory of herself was it his own name she had tried hopelessly to cry out the girl swayed as if torn between mighty forces that stormed within her read out the spells achren ordered little by little the light of the golden pelydryn grew brighter throughout the great hall rose a faint confused whispering as though the wind had gained tongue urging cajoling commanding the very stones of caer colur seemed to have taken voice quickly quickly cried achren eilonwy taran realized in a surge of hope was struggling against all that held her the anguished girl was beyond all threats of achren beyond all help from the companions then suddenly her lonely combat ended taran cried out in despair as eilonwy raised the glowing sphere and in a quick motion brought it close to the empty pages the golden pelydryn flared brighter than he had ever seen it and taran flung up his hand to shield his eyes light flooded the hall gurgi threw himself to the ground and covered his head with his shaggy arms the companions drew back fearfully suddenly eilonwy cast the book to the flagstones from the pages burst a crimson cloud that spread into a sheet of fire leaping upward to the vaulted ceiling of the great hall even as the book of spells consumed itself in its own flames the blaze did not dwindle but instead rose ever higher roaring and crackling no longer crimson but blindingly white the shriveled pages swirled in a fiery whirlwind to dance within the shimmering heart of the flame and as they did the whispering voices of caer colur groaned in defeat the scarlet curtains of the alcove blew outward seized in the writhing column of fire now the book had vanished utterly but still the flames mounted unappeased achren was shrieking shrieking in rage and frenzy her face distorted with hopeless fury still clutching the golden pelydryn eilonwy crumpled and fell chapter the flood gwydion leaped forward your power is ended achren he cried the livid queen staggered for an instant then turned and fled screaming from the great hall taran raced to eilonwys side and heedless of the flames struggled to raise the girls limp body gwydion sped to overtake achren the bard followed them his sword drawn magg had vanished gurgi and prince rhun hastened to aid taran within moments fflewddur returned his face was ashen the spider tries to drown us he shouted magg has opened the gates to the sea as the bard called out taran heard a thunder of surf caer colur trembled shouldering the unconscious eilonwy he stumbled through a ruined casement kaw circled frantically above the towers fflewddur was urging the companions toward the portals where they might hope to gain the boat taran followed him only to see in despair the great ironbound gates nearly ripped from their hinges by tho the pounding water shattered they had swung inward and the foaming tide rushed upon the island like a ravening beast beyond the walls at the crest of a driving wave rode achrens vessel mast askew and sails flapping the surviving warriors clung to the sides of the tossing craft and fought to climb aboard at the bow stood magg his face contorted with hate shaking his fist at the crumbling fortress the wreckage of gwydions boat spun in the flood and taran knew all means of escape were shattered with it the outer walls crumbled under the first impact of the sea blocks of stone shuddered and split away the towers of caer colur swayed and the ground reeled under tarans feet gwydions voice rang above the tumult save yourselves caer colur is destroyed jump clear of the walls or they will crush you taran saw that the prince of don had clambered to the highest rocks of the embankment to which achren had fled there gwydion strove to lead her from the collapsing stones but she struck at him and clawed his face her shrieks and curses pierced the rumble of onrushing waves gwydion faltered and fell as the embankment gave way the last barrier of ruined wall toppled a hissing sheet of water blotted out the sky taran clasped eilonwy to him the flood swept them away and bore them under salt foam choked him and the merciless buffeting of the tide nearly tore the unconscious girl from his arms he struggled upward while the island split and sank in a whirlpool that clutched him gripping eilonwy taran fought dear of the whirlpool only to fall prey to breakers tossing him like wild stallions he spun to the trough of the waves while the sea pounded strength and breath from him still he was able to hope for it seemed the whitecrested breakers were bearing him and his frail burden closer to shore dizzied and halfblinded by the greenblack waves taran caught a confused glimpse of beach and shallow surf he struck out weakly with his free arm but in this last effort his failing body betrayed him and he tumbled into darkness taran awoke under a gray sky the roaring in his ears was not the surf two enormous yellow eyes peered into his own the roaring grew louder hot breath was on his face as tarans sight cleared he saw sharp teeth and a pair of tufted ears he realized in confusion that he was lying flat on his back and llyan was standing over him with one huge padded paw on his chest he cried out in alarm and struggled to free himself hullo hullo prince rhun was now bending over him a wide grin on his round face beside him was fflewddur the bard like rhun was soaked and bedraggled and strands of dripping seaweed hung from his yellow hair steady now said fflewddur llyan means you no harm she only wants to be friendly though sometimes she has odd ways of showing it he patted the cats great head and scratched under her mighty jaws come llyan he coaxed theres a good girl dont stand on my friend hes not up to it yet behave yourself and ill play you a tune as soon as my harp strings dry fflewddur turned once more to taran we have to thank llyan for a great deal everything in fact she fished us all out of the surf after the sea had washed us up if she hadnt im afraid we should still be there it was really surprising put in prince rhun i thought for certain id been drowned and the curious thing was i couldnt notice any difference i did have a start when i came to my senses with llyan sitting beside me said fflewddur she had my harp between her paws as though she couldnt wait for me to wake up and begin again the creature is mad about my music thats why she tracked us all the way here and great belin im glad she did but i think shes finally understood theres a time and place for everything shes really been quite gentle he added as llyan began to rub her head against him with such vigor the bard could hardly keep his balance where are the others taran interrupted anxiously kaw i fear is nowhere to be found gurgis gone looking for driftwood to build a fire replied the bard poor creature hes still terrified of llyan but hell get used to her ive grown quite fond of her myself its not often one finds such a good listener and i think i shall keep her or he added while llyan nuzzled her whiskers on his neck and gripped the bard with her powerful paws perhaps i should put it the other way around what of eilonwy of gwydion taran pressed the bards glance fell yes well he murmured theyre here gwydion has done all he can with mounting anxiety taran rose unsteadily to his feet in the lee of a tumble of rock gwydion knelt beside two forms taran stumbled across the beach gwydion looked up at him his face filled with concern eilonwy lives he said answering the question in tarans eyes more than that i can not say this much i know achren no longer holds her achren achren is dead then taran asked he stared at the blackshrouded figure achren too lives answered gwydion though long she hung between life and death but her power is broken now this is the answer to the riddle yet i did not know it until i stood before her in the great hall at first i was not certain when l understood that she would truly let herself go down to death before giving up eilonwy i knew she had lost command of all but the least of her own enchantments i read it in her eyes and in her voice her day had begun to wane from the moment she had broken with the lord of annuvin the spells of caer colur were her last hope now they are gone and caer colur lies at the bottom of the sea gwydion added we need fear achren no longer i fear her still taran said and i shall not forget caer colur achren spoke the truth to me he went on quietly i had not the strength to listen to her any longer i feared i would tell the hiding place of the pelydryn and hoped you would slay me before i did yet taran added puzzled it was you yourself who spoke it was a risk that had to be taken gwydion replied i had suspected something of the nature of the bauble as it alone could reveal the spells so it alone could destroy them only then could eilonwy be free at what cost to herself i could not be sure alas she has suffered deeply and grievously perhaps too much dare we waken her taran whispered touch her not said gwydion she must waken of herself we can only wait and hope taran bowed his head i would have given my life to keep her from harm and i would give it now to spare her this he smiled bitterly achren asked what shall be the lot of an assistant pigkeeper it is a question i have often asked myself i see now the life of an assistant pigkeeper is of little use or import even to offer it for someone else is of no avail prince rhun would gainsay you gwydion answered without you he would have wandered lost and in mortal danger i swore an oath to king rhuddlum taran replied i did not break it and had you not sworn an oath gwydion asked would you not have done the same taran was silent for a while then he nodded yes i believe i would it was more than my oath that bound me he needed my help as i needed his he turned to gwydion i remember too when a prince of don aided a foolish assistant pigkeeper is it not fitting now for the pigkeeper to aid a prince whether it be prince or pigkeeper said gwydion such is the way of a man the destinies of men are woven one with the other and you can turn aside from them no more than you can turn aside from your own and you lord gwydion came achrens voice you have put a cruel destiny upon me the blackcloaked figure had risen achren clung to the rocks to bear herself up her face halfhooded was drawn and haggard and her lips were pale death would have been a kindness why did you deny it to me taran shrank back as the oncehaughty queen raised her head for an instant he saw her eyes flame again with pride and fury you have destroyed me gwydion she cried do you hope to see me grovel at your feet are my powers indeed stripped away achren laughed harshly one last remains to me it was then taran saw she held a weathered branch of driftwood she lifted it high and taran gasped as in her hands it blurred and shimmered suddenly in its place was a dagger with a shout of triumph achren plunged it toward her own breast gwydion sprang to her and seized her wrists achren fought against him as he tore the blade from her grasp once more the dagger became driftwood which gwydion snapped in two and cast away achren fell sobbing to the sand your enchantments have ever been the enchantments of death said gwydion he knelt and gently placed a hand on her shoulder seek life achren no life remains to me but that of an outcast cried achren turning from him leave me to myself gwydion nodded find your own path achren he said softly should it lead you to caer dallben know this dallben will not turn you away the sky had grown heavy with clouds and though it was little past midday the high crags rising at the shore seemed purple with dusk gurgi had built a fire of driftwood and the companions sat silently near the sleeping eilonwy farther down the beach achren muffled in her cloak crouched alone and unmoving for all that morning taran had not left eilonwys side fearful she might never wake and fearful too that she might waken as a stranger to him still he did not rest from his weary vigil gwydion himself could not foretell how longlasting was the harm that had been done her do not lose heart gwydion said it is good that she sleeps and more healing to her spirit than any potion i could give her eilonwy stirred restlessly taran started up gwydion put a hand on his arm and gently drew him back eilonwys eyelids fluttered gwydion his face grave watched closely as her eyes opened and she slowly raised her head chapter the pledge the princess sat up and looked curiously at the companions eilonwy taran whispered do you know us taran of caer dallben said eilonwy only an assistant pigkeeper could ask a question like that of course i know you what i dont know is what im doing soaking wet and covered with sand on this beach gwydion smiled the princess eilonwy has come back to us gurgi shouted with joy and in that instant taran fflewddur and prince rhun began talking all at once eilonwy clapped her hands over her ears stop stop she cried youre making my head swim listening to you is more confusing than trying to count your fingers and toes at the same time the companions forced themselves to be silent while gwydion quickly told her all that had happened when he had finished eilonwy shook her head i can see you had a much more interesting time than i had she said scratching llyans chin as the immense cat purred with pleasure especially since i dont recall much of it too bad that magg escaped eilonwy went on i wish he were here now i should have a few things to take up with him that morning when i was on my way to breakfast he came looming out of one of the corridors he told me something very serious had happened and i was to come with him immediately if only we could have warned you taran began warned me eilonwy replied of magg i knew straight off from the very look of him he was up to something taran stared at her and yet you went with him naturally said eilonwy how else was i going to find out you were so busy sitting in front of my chamber and threatening to have a guard put round me i knew there was no use trying to get any sense out of you do not judge him harshly said gwydion smiling he thought only to protect you he was under my orders to do so yes i realize that said eilonwy and i soon began to wish all of you had been with me by then it was too late wed no sooner got clear of the castle than magg tied me up and gagged me that was the worst of it i couldnt speak a word but it spoiled his own scheme she went on he had indeed waited in the hills until the searching party was far ahead of us then he dragged me into the boat his shins will be black and blue for a while to come i assure you but i dropped my bauble since i was gagged i couldnt make him understand i wanted it back but it served him right achren was furious when she saw i didnt have it she blamed magg and im surprised she didnt have his head off then and there to me she was very sweet and thoughtful so i knew right away something disagreeable was to come after that eilonwy continued achren cast a spell over me and i remember very little until the bauble was in my hands once more then then it was very strange in the light of it i could see all of you not with my eyes really but in my heart i knew you wanted me to destroy the spells and i wanted to as much as you did yet it was as though there were two of me one did and one didnt want to give up the spells i knew it was my only chance to become an enchantress and if i gave up my powers then that would be the end of it i suppose she said softly to taran i felt a little the way you did long ago in the marshes of morva when you had to decide to give up adaons magic brooch the rest of it wasnt pleasant eilonwys voice faltered id id rather not talk about that she was silent a moment now i shall never be an enchantress theres nothing left for me now except being a girl that is more than enough cause for pride gwydion said gently for all you chose to sacrifice you have kept achren from ruling prydain we owe more than our lives to you im glad the book of spells burned up eilonwy said but im sorry i lost my bauble by this time its surely floated far out to sea she sighed theres nothing to be done about that but i shall miss it as she spoke taran glimpsed a flickering movement against the dark gray sky he leaped to his feet it was kaw swooping landward at top speed the last of our strays cried fflewddur llyans ears pricked up her long whiskers twitched but she made no attempt to lunge for the crow instead she rose to her haunches and purred fondly at the sight of her former opponent his feathers bedraggled and pointing every which way kaw fluttered above eilonwy despite his disreputable appearance he squawked and snapped his beak with enormous selfsatisfaction bauble kaw croaked bauble from his claws the golden pelydryn dropped into eilonwys outstretched hands gwydion at first had decided the companions should rest until morning but prince rhun was eager to return to dinas rhydnant theres a great deal to be done he said im afraid weve let magg look after things we should have seen to ourselves theres more to being a prince than i thought ive learned that from an assistant pigkeeper he added clasping tarans hand and from all of you and theres still most of mona to be seen if im ever to be king im sure i should see it all though i hope in a rather different way so if you dont mind i should like to set out now gurgi had no wish to linger anywhere near caer colur and fflewddur could hardly wait to show llyan her new home in his own realm eilonwy insisted she was quite able to travel and at last gwydion agreed they would start without delay he agreed too that they would pass by the cavern to see how glew fared for taran still held to the promise he had made to help the wretched giant the ragged band made ready to leave the coast achren finally consenting to voyage to caer dallben walked slowly withdrawn into her own thoughts while llyan frisked beside the bard and kaw sported overhead eilonwy had gone for a moment to the edge of the surf taran following her stood as she watched the dancing waves i thought i should have a last look at caer colur eilonwy said just to remember where it is or rather where it isnt im sorry in a way that its gone outside of caer dallben it was the only home i had once you are safe at dinas rhydnant taran said i shall stay no longer on mona i had hoped after all youd been through that that youd come back with us but gwydion is sure that dallben meant for you to stay here i suppose hes right i can hear dallben now being rescued has nothing to do with being educated eilonwy said nothing for a while then she turned to taran one thing more i remembered at caer colur dallbens saying that there was a time when we must be more than what we are can it be true that being a young lady is more important than being an enchantress perhaps thats what he meant i shall have to find out for myself so if i must learn to be a young lady whatever that may be thats any different from what i am eilonwy continued then i shall try to learn twice as fast as those silly geese at dinas rhydhant and be home twice as soon for caer daliben is my only real home now why whats this eilonwy cried suddenly the sea has given us a present she knelt and from the foaming surf drew a battered object and stripped away the trailing seaweed taran saw an ancient battle horn bound in silver with a silver mouthpiece eilonwy turned it over in her hands and looked carefully at it she smiled sadly its all thats left of caer colur what use it might be i dont know and never shall but if you promise not to forget me until we meet again i promise not to forget you and this shall be my pledge i promise gladly taran said he hesitated but what pledge have i to give you i have none other than my word the word of an assistant pigkeeper said eilonwy that shall do very well indeed here take it giving gifts is much nicer than saying farewell and yet taran answered we must say farewell you know that king rhuddlum and queen teleria mean to betroth you to prince rhun indeed exclaimed eilonwy well i assure you they shall do no such thing theres limits to having people make up your mind for you rhun has certainly improved i think this journey was the best thing that ever happened to him and someday he might even make a respectable sort of king but as for being betrothed she stopped suddenly and looked at taran did you seriously think for a moment i would ever taran of caer dallben she cried angrily her eyes flashing im not speaking to you at least eilonwy added quickly not for a little while
