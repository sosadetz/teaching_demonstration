the chronicles of prydain book four taran wanderer lloyd alexander authors note this fourth chronicle of prydain begins as a gallant highhearted quest which soon becomes more intense and perhaps more essentially heroic than the preceding adventures for here taran comes to grips with a merciless opponent the truth about himself no longer as taran assistant pigkeeper but as taran wanderer he learns to reshape his life out of his own inner resources for there must not only be an end to childhood but also a beginning of manhood this is meant to be a serious tale in the way that all humor is serious and all fantasy true and if there is no conventionally happy ending in fairytale terms there is still a most hopeful ending in human terms this does not imply any less humor or variety in the story there is possibly more as tarans journey takes him from one end of prydain to the other from the marshes of morva to the free commots however instead of a clash of battle hosts the underlying conflict between good and evil is stated in individual encounters king smoit boisterous with being alive morda deathlike scornful of all humanity dorath the amoral annlaw clayshaper the creator craddoc in whose desolate valley taran suffers the anguish of shame the princess eilonwy alas is present only in memory though it is hoped readers will miss her as much as taran does and the author himself for that matter while certain inhabitants of prydain were born of welsh legend in taran wanderer they have acquired characteristics more universal than specific mordas life secret for example is familiar in many mythologies orddu orwen and orgoch have appeared in other guises as might well be expected of them the three norns the moirae the triple goddess and very likely some other transformations they decline to admit prydain of course is partmemory and partdream the balance favoring the latter the companions have gained many more friends than i had ever hoped who are willing to follow these tales both as selfcontained chronicles and as part of a larger pattern and to them i promise in time all questions will be answered and all secrets revealed to some friends of the companions especially gypsy reeves i address a plea for clemency to others my sincere thanks for their hard but invaluable labor insight and encouragement when the straits seemed even more dire to an author than to an assistant pigkeeper and to all my warmest affection la chapter who am i it was full springtime with promise of the richest summer the farm had ever seen the orchard was white with fragrant blossoms the newly planted fields lay light as green mist yet the sights and scents gave taran little joy to him caer dallben was empty though he helped coll with the weeding and cultivating and tended the white pig hen wen with as much care as ever he went about his tasks distractedly one thought alone was in his mind now my boy coll said goodnaturedly as they finished the mornings milking ive seen you restless as a wolf on a tether ever since you came back from the isle of mona pine for the princess eilonwy if you must but dont upset the milk pail the stout old warrior clapped taran on the shoulder come cheer up ill teach you the high secrets of planting turnips or raising cabbages or whatever you might want to know taran shook his head what i would know only dallben can tell me take my counsel then said coll trouble dallben with none of your questions his thoughts are on deeper matter have patience and bide your time taran rose to his feet i can bide my time no longer it is in my heart to speak with him now have a care warned coll as taran strode to the door of the shed his disposition rubs a little thin taran made his way through the cluster of lowroofed farm buildings in the cottage at the hearthside a blackrobed woman crouched and tended the cooking fire she did not raise her head or speak it was achren thwarted in her scheme to regain her ancient power from the ruined castle of llyr the oncehaughty queen had accepted the refuge dallben offered though by her own choice she who had long ago ruled prydain toiled now at the tasks eilonwy had done before departing for mona and at days end silently vanished to her pallet of straw in the granary before dallbens chamber taran paused uneasily then rapped quickly on the door entering at the enchanters command he found dallben bent over the book of three which lay open on the cluttered table much as he longed for a glimpse at even one page of this secret volume taran kept his distance from it once in boyhood he had dared touch the ancient leatherbound tome and his fingers smarted again at the memory i never cease to wonder dallben testily remarked closing the book of three and glancing at taran that the young with all their pride of strength should find their own concerns such a weighty burden they must be shared with the old whereas the old he waved a frail bony hand but no matter no matter for the sake of my temper i hope your purpose in interrupting me is an excellent one first before you ask dallben went on i assure you the princess eilonwy is well and no more unhappy than any pretty young madcap obliged to turn a hand to sewing instead of swordplay second you are as aware as i am that kaw has not yet returned by now i daresay he has borne my potion to glews cavern and the giantbyaccident who troubled you so much on mona will shrink to the small stature he once had but you also know your crow for a rascal and one to linger wherever he finds sport finally an assistant pigkeeper should have tasks enough to busy himself outdoors what then brings you here one thing only taran said all that i have i owe to your kindness you have given me a home and a name and let me live as a son in your household yet who am i in truth who are my parents you have taught me much but kept this always from me since it has been always thus dallben replied why should it trouble you now when taran bowed his head and did not answer the old enchanter smiled shrewdly at him speak up my boy if you want truth you should begin by giving it behind your question i think i see the shadow of a certain goldenhaired princess is that not so tarans face flushed it is so he murmured he raised his eyes to meet dallbens when eilonwy returns it it is in my heart to ask her to wed but this i can not do he burst out this i will not do until i learn who i am an unknown foundling with a borrowed name can not ask for the hand of a princess what is my parentage i can not rest until i know am i lowly born or nobly to my mind dallben said softly the latter would please you better it would be my hope taran admitted a little abashed but no matter if there is honor yes let me share it if there is shame let me face it it takes as much strength of heart to share the one as to face the other dallben replied gently he turned his careworn face to taran but alas he said what you ask i may not answer prince gwydion knows no more than i he went on sensing tarans thought nor can the high king math help you then let me learn for myself taran cried give me leave to seek my own answer dallben studied him carefully the enchanters eyes fell on the book of three and he gazed long at it as though his glance penetrated deep into the worn leather volume once the apple is ripe he murmured to himself no man can turn it back to a greening his voice grew heavy with sorrow as he said to taran is this indeed your wish tarans heart quickened i ask nothing more dallben nodded so it must be journey then wherever you choose learn what lies in your power to learn you have all my thanks taran cried joyfully bowing deeply let me start without delay i am ready before he could finish the door burst open and a shaggy figure sped across the chamber and flung itself at tarans feet no no no howled gurgi at the top of his voice rocking back and forth and waving his hairy arms sharpeared gurgi hears all oh yes with listenings behind the door his face wrinkled in misery and he shook his matted head so violently he nearly sprawled flat on the floor poor gurgi will be lone and lorn with whinings and pinings he moaned oh he must go with master yes yes taran put a hand on gurgis shoulder it would sadden me to leave you old friend but my road i fear may be a long one faithful gurgi will follow pleaded gurgi he is strong bold and clever to keep kindly master from harmful hurtings gurgi began snuffling loudly whimpering and moaning more desperately than before and taran who could not bring himself to deny the unhappy creature looked questioningly at dallben a strange glance of pity crossed the enchanters face gurgis staunchness and good sense i do not doubt he said to taran though before your search is ended the comfort of his kindly heart may stand you in better stead yes he added slowly if gurgi is willing let him journey with you gurgi gave a joyous yelp and taran bowed gratefully to the enchanter so be it dallben said your road indeed will not be easy but set out on it as you choose though you may not find what you seek you will surely return a little wiser and perhaps even grown to manhood in your own right that night taran lay restless dallben had agreed the two companions could depart in the morning but for taran the hours until sunrise weighed like the links of a heavy chain a plan had formed in his mind but he had said nothing of it to dallben coll or gurgi for he was half fearful of what he had decided while his heart ached at the thought of leaving caer dallben it ached the more with impatience to begin his journey and it was as though his yearning for eilonwy the love he had often hidden or even denied now swelled like a flood driving him before it long before dawn taran rose and saddled the gray silvermaned stallion melynlas while gurgi blinking and yawning readied his own mount a short stocky pony almost as shaggy as himself taran went alone to hen wens enclosure as though she had already sensed tarans decision the white pig squealed dolefully as he knelt and put an arm around her farewell hen taran said scratching her bristly chin remember me kindly coll will care for you until i oh hen he murmured shall i come happily to the end of my quest can you tell me can you give me some sign of good hope in answer however the oracular pig only wheezed and grunted anxiously taran sighed and gave hen wen a last affectionate pat dallben had hobbled into the dooryard and beside him coll raised a torch for the morning still was dark like dallbens the old warriors face in the wavering light was filled with fond concern taran embraced them and to him it seemed his love for both had never been greater than at this leavetaking as they said their farewells gurgi sat hunched atop the pony slung from his shoulder was his leather wallet with its inexhaustible supply of food bearing only his sword at his belt and the silverbound battle horn eilonwy had given him taran swung astride the impatient melynlas constraining himself not to glance backward knowing if he did his parting would grieve him the more deeply the two wayfarers rode steadily while the sun climbed higher above the rolling treefringed hills taran had spoken little and gurgi trotted quietly behind him delving now and again into the leather wallet for a handful of food which he munched contentedly when they halted to water their mounts at a stream gurgi clambered down and went to tarans side kindly master he cried faithful gurgi follows as he leads oh yes where does he journey first with amblings and ramblings to noble lord gwydion at caer dathyl gurgi longs to see high golden towers and great halls for feastings i too answered taran but it would be labor lost dallben has told me prince gwydion and king math know nothing of my parentage then to kingdom of fflewddur fflam yes yes bold bard will welcome us with meetings and greetings with merry hummings and strummings taran smiled at gurgis eagerness but shook his head no my friend not to caer dathyl nor to fflewddurs realm he turned his eyes westward i have thought carefully of this and believe there is only one place where i might find what i seek he said slowly the marshes of morva no sooner had he spoken these words than he saw gurgis face turn ashen the creatures jaw dropped he clapped his hands to his shaggy head and began gasping and choking frightfully no oh no gurgi howled dangers lurk in evil marshes bold but cautious gurgi fears for his poor tender head he wants never to return there fearsome enchantresses would have turned him into a toad with hoppings and floppings oh terrible orddu terrible orwen and orgoch oh orgoch worst of all yet i mean to face them again taran said orddu orwen and orgoch she or they or whatever they may really be are as powerful as dallben perhaps more powerful nothing is hidden from them all secrets are open they would know the truth could it not be he went on his voice quickening hopefully could it not be that my parents were of noble lineage and for some secret reason left me with dallben to foster but kindly master is noble gurgi cried noble generous and good to humble gurgi no need to ask enchantresses i speak of noble blood taran replied smiling at gurgis protests if dallben can not tell me then orddu may whether she will i do not know he added but i must try i wont have you risk your poor tender head taran continued you shall find a hiding place at the edge of the marshes and wait for me there no no gurgi moaned he blinked wretchedly and his voice fell so low that taran could scarcely hear his trembling whisper faithful gurgi follows as he promised they set out again for some days after fording great avren they bore quickly westward along the green slopes of the riverbank leaving it reluctantly to wend north across a fallow plain gurgis face puckered anxiously and taran sensed the creatures disquiet no less than his own the closer they drew to the marshes the more he questioned the wisdom of his choice his plan which had seemed so fitting in the safety of caer dallben now struck him as rash a foolhardy venture there were moments when taran admitted to himself had gurgi spun the pony about and bolted homeward he would have gladly done likewise another days travel and the marshland stretched before them bleak ugly untouched by spring the sight and scent of the bogs and the dull stagnant pools filled taran with loathing the rotting turf sucked greedily at the hooves of melynlas the pony snorted fearfully warning gurgi to stay close behind him and stray neither to the right nor left taran cautiously guided the stallion through beds of reeds shoulderhigh keeping to the firmer ground at the rim of the swamps the narrow neck at the upper reaches of the marshes could be crossed with least danger and the path indeed was burned into his memory here when he and eiionwy gurgi and fflewddur had sought the black cauldron the huntsmen of annuvin had attacked them and taran had lived the moment again and again in nightmares giving melynlas rein he beckoned to gurgi and rode into the marshes the stallion faltered a sickening instant then found footing on the chain of islands that lay beneath the brackish water at the far side without tarans urging melynlas broke into a gallop and the pony pelted after as though fleeing for its life beyond the stunted trees at the end of a long gully taran halted orddus cottage lay straight ahead built against the side of a high mound halfhidden by sod and branches it seemed in even greater disrepair than taran had remembered the thatched roof like a huge birds nest straggled down to block the narrow windows a spider web of mold covered the walls which looked ready to tumble at any moment in the crooked doorway stood orddu herself heart pounding taran swung from the saddle holding his head high in a silence broken only by the chattering of gurgis teeth he strode slowly across the dooryard orddu was watching him with sharp black eyes if she was surprised the enchantress gave no sign other than to bend forward a little and peer more closely at taran her shapeless robe flapped about her knees the jeweled clasps and pins glittered in her weedy tangle of disheveled hair as she nodded her head rapidly and with evident satisfaction yes and so it is orddu called out pleasantly the dear little fledgling and the whateveryoucallit but youve grown much taller my duck how troublesome it must be should you ever want to climb down a rabbit hole come in come in she hurried on beckoning so pale you are poor thing youve not been ill taran followed her not without uneasiness while gurgi shuddering clung to him beware beware the creature whimpered warm welcomings give gurgi frosty chillings the three enchantresses so far as taran could see had been busy at household tasks orgoch her black hood shrouding her features sat on a rickety stool trying without great success to tease cockleburs from a lapful of wool shearings orwen if indeed it was orwen was turning a rather lopsided spinning wheel the milky white beads dangling from her neck seemed in danger of catching in the spokes orddu herself he guessed had been at the loom that stood amid piles of ancient rusted weapons in a corner of the cottage the work on the frame had gone forward somewhat but it was far from done knotted twisted threads straggled in all directions and what looked like some of orgochs cockleburs were snagged in the warp and weft taran could make out nothing of the pattern though it seemed to him as if by some trick of his eyes that vague shapes human and animal moved and shifted through the weaving but he had no chance to study the curious tapestry orwen leaving the wheel hastened to him clapping her hands delightedly the wandering chicken and the gurgi she cried and how is dear little dallben does he still have the book of three and his beard how heavy it must be for him the book not the beard she added did he not come with you mores the pity but no matter its so charming to have visitors i dont care for visitors muttered orgoch irritably tossing the wool to the ground they disagree with me of course they do greedy thing orwen replied sharply and a wonder it is that we have any at all at this orgoch snorted and mumbled under her breath beneath her black hood taran glimpsed a shadowy grimace orddu raised a hand pay orgoch no heed she said to taran shes out of sorts today poor dear it was orwens turn to be orgoch and orgoch was so looking forward to being orwen now shes disappointed since orwen at the last moment simply refused not that i blame her orddu whispered i dont enjoy being orgoch either but well make it up to her somehow and you orddu went on a smile wrinkling her lumpy face you are the boldest of bold goslings few in prydain have been willing to brave the marshes of morva and of those few not one has dared to return perhaps orgoch disheartens them you alone have done so my chick oh orddu he is a brave hero orwen put in looking at taran with girlish admiration dont talk nonsense orwen orddu replied there are heroes and heroes i dont deny hes acted bravely on occasion hes fought beside lord gwydion and been proud of himself as a chick wearing eagles feathers but thats only one kind of bravery has the darling robin ever scratched for his own worms thats bravery of another sort and between the two dear orwen he might find the latter shows the greater courage the enchantress turned to taran but speak up my fledgling why do you seek us again dont tell us interrupted orwen let us guess oh but i do love games though orgoch always spoils them she giggled you shall give us a thousand and three guesses and i shall be first to ask very well orwen if it pleases you orddu said indulgently but are a thousand and three enough a young lamb can want for so much your concern is with things as they are taran said forcing himself to look the enchantress in the eyes and with things as they must be i believe you know my quest from its beginning to its end and that i seek to learn my parentage parentage said orddu nothing easier choose any parents you please since none of you has ever known each other what difference can it possibly make to them or to you believe what you like youll be surprised how comforting it is i ask no comfort taran replied but the truth be it harsh or happy ah my sweet robin said orddu for the finding of that nothing is harder there are those who have spent lifetimes at it and many in worse plight than yours there was a frog some time ago orddu went on cheerfully i remember him well poor dear never sure whether he was a land creature who liked swimming under water or a water creature who liked sunning himself on logs we turned him into a stork with a keen appetite for frogs and from then on he had no doubts as to who he was nor did the other frogs for the matter of that we would gladly do the same for you for both of you said orgoch no yelled gurgi ducking behind taran oh kindly master gurgi warned of fearsome changings and arrangings dont forget the serpent orwen told orddu all fretted and perplexed because he didnt know if he was green with brown spots or brown with green ones we made him an invisible serpent she added with brown and green spots so he could be clearly seen and not trodden on he was so grateful and much easier in his mind after that and i recall croaked orgoch huskily clearing her throat there was a do be still orgoch orwen interrupted your tales always have such such untidy endings you see my pullet orddu said we can help you in many ways all quickerand simpler than any you might think of what would you rather be if you want my opinion i suggest a hedgehog its a safer life than most but dont let me sway your choice its entirely up to you on the contrary lets surprise them cried orwen in happy excitement well decide among ourselves and spare them the tedious business of making up their minds theyll be all the more pleased how charming it will be to see the look on their little faces or beaks or whatever it is they finally have no fowls grumbled orgoch no fowls in any case cant abide them feathers make me cough gurgis fright had so mounted he could only babble wordlessly taran felt his own blood run cold orddu had taken a step forward and taran defensively reached for his sword now now my chicken orddu cheerily remarked dont lose your temper or you may lose considerably more you know your blade is useless here and waving swords is no way to set anyone in a proper frame of mind it was you who chose to put yourselves in our hands hands growled orgoch from the depths of the hood her eyes flashed redly and her mouth began twitching taran stood firm orddu he said keeping his voice as steady as he could will you tell me what i ask if not we will go our way we were only trying to make things easier for you said orwen pouting and fingering her beads you neednt take offense of course we shall tell you my brave tadpole orddu said you shall know all you seek to know directly weve settled another matter the price to be paid since what you ask is of such importance to yourself at least the cost may be rather high but im sure you thought of that before you came when we sought the black cauldron taran began you took adaons enchanted brooch in fee the one thing i treasured most since then i have found nothing i have prized more but my chicken said orddu we struck that bargain long ago it is over and done are you saying you brought nothing with you why count yourself lucky to become a hedgehog since you can afford little else last time orgoch hoarsely whispered in orddus ear you would have taken one of the young lambs summer days and a tasty morsel it would have been you are always thinking of your own pleasures orgoch replied orddu you might at least try to think of what we all would like there was a goldenhaired girl with him then orwen put in a pretty little creature he surely has lovely memories of her could we not take them she went on eagerly how delightful it would be to spread them out and look at them during long winter evenings alas he would have none for himself but i think it would be an excellent bargain taran caught his breath even you would not be so pitiless would we not answered orddu smiling pity dear gosling as you know it at least simply doesnt enter into the question as far as were concerned however she went on turning to orwen that wont answer either we already have quite enough memories hear me then cried taran drawing himself to his full height he clenched his hands to keep them from trembling it is true i own little to treasure not even my name is there nothing you will have of me this i offer you he went on quickly in a low voice he felt his brow dampen though he had taken this decision at caer dallben and weighed it carefully with the moment upon him he nearly faltered and longed to turn from it whatever thing of value i may find in all my life to come taran said the greatest treasure that may come into my hands i pledge it to you now it shall be yours and you shall claim it when you please orddu did not answer only looked at him curiously the other enchantresses were silent even gurgi had ceased his whimpering the shapes on the loom seemed to writhe before tarans eyes as he waited for orddu to speak the enchantress smiled does your quest mean so much that you will spend what you have not yet gained or may never gain croaked orgoch no more can i offer taran cried you can not refuse me the kind of bargain you propose said orddu in a pleasant but matteroffact tone is a chancy thing at best and really satisfies no one nothing is all that certain and very often weve found the poor sparrow who makes such a pledge never lives long enough to fulfill it when he does there is always the risk of his turning well shall we say a little stubborn it usually ends with unhappy feelings all around once we might have accepted but sad experience made us put a stop to it altogether no my fledgling it wont do were sorry that is sorry as much as we can feel sorrow for anything tarans voice caught in his throat for an instant the features of the enchantress shifted he could not be sure whether it was orddu orwen or orgoch whom he faced it was as though there had risen in front of him a wall of ice which force could not breach nor pleading melt despair choked him he bowed his head and turned away but my dear gosling orddu called cheerily thats not to say there arent others to answer your question of course there are added orwen and the finding takes no more than the looking who then taran asked urgently seizing on this new hope i recall a brownandorange ousel that comes once a year to sharpen his beak on mount kilgwyry said orwen he knows all that has ever happened if youre patient you might wait and ask him oh orwen orddu interrupted with some impatience sometimes i do believe you dwell too much in the past mount kilgwyry has been worn down long ago with his pecking and the little darling has flown elsewhere youre so right dear orddu replied orwen it had slipped my mind for a moment but what of the salmon of lake llew ive never met a wiser fish gone muttered orgoch sucking a tooth long gone in any case ousels and fishes are flighty and slippery orddu said something more reliable would serve better you might for example try the mirror of llunet the mirror of llunet taran repeated i have never heard it spoken of what is it where best yet orgoch broke in he could stay with us and the gurgi too do try to control yourself dear orgoch when im explaining something orddu remarked then turned back to taran yes perhaps if you looked into it the mirror of llunet would show you something of interest but where taran began again too far grumbled orgoch stay by all means in the llawgadarn mountains replied orddu taking him by the arm if it hasnt been moved but come along my gosling orgoch is growing restless i know shed enjoy having you here and with two disappointments in the same day i shouldnt want to account for her behavior but how may i find it taran could do no more than stammer his question before he was outside the cottage with gurgi trembling at his side dont tarry in the marshes orddu called while from within the cottage taran heard loud and angry noises else you may regret your foolish boldness or bold foolishness whichever farewell my robin the crooked door closed tightly even as taran cried out for orddu to wait flee gurgi yelped flee kindly master while gurgis poor tender head is still on his shoulders despite the creatures frantic tugging at his arm taran stood staring at the door his thoughts were confused a strange heaviness had settled upon him why did she mock my bravery he said frowning courage to scratch for worms that task would be far easier than seeking the mirror of llunet hasten gurgi pleaded gurgi has his fill of questings now he is ready for returnings to safe and happy caer dallben yes yes oh do not make useless peekings and seekings taran hesitated a moment longer of the llawgadarn mountains he knew only that they rose far to the east with nothing to guide his search the journey might indeed prove useless gurgi looked imploringly at him taran patted the creatures shoulder then turned and strode to melynlas the mirror of llunet is the only hope orddu has given me taran said i must find it while gurgi hastily mounted his pony taran swung astride melynlas he glanced once again at the cottage his heart suddenly uneasy given me he murmured does orddu give anything for nothing chapter cantrev cadiffor the two companions left the marshes of morva pressing southeastward to the valley cantrevs along the ystrad river for taran had decided to break his journey at caer cadarn fortress of king smoit and ask the redbearded king to refit them with gear sturdier than what they had brought from caer dallben from there taran told gurgi we can only search as the moment guides us my poor tender head is full of questions he sighed with a wry and regretful smile but of plans alas none at all with the marshes many days behind the two companions crossed the borders of cadiffor smoits realm and largest of the valley cantrevs the countryside had long since changed from gray moors to green meadows and pleasantly wooded lands with farmholds nestled in the clearings though gurgi eyed the dells longingly sniffing the smoke of cookfires wafting from the cottage chimneys taran did not turn from the path he had chosen by keeping a brisk pace another three days of travel would bring them to caer cadarn a little before sundown seeing the clouds growing heavy and dark taran halted to find shelter in a pine grove he had scarcely dismounted and gurgi had only begun to unlash the saddlebags when a band of horsemen cantered into the grove taran spun around and drew his blade gurgi yelping in alarm scurried to his masters side there were five riders wellmounted and armed their roughbearded faces sunblackened their bearing that of men long used to the saddle the colors they wore were not those of the house of smoit and taran guessed the horsemen to be warriors in the service of one of smoits liegemen put up your blade commanded the leading rider nevertheless drawing his own reining up before the wayfarers and glancing scornfully at them who are you who do you serve theyre outlaws cried another strike them down they look more like scarecrows than outlaws replied the leader i take them for a pair of churls who have run away from their master taran lowered his sword but did not sheathe it i am taran assistant pigkeeper where then are your pigs cried the first rider with a coarse laugh and why are you not at keeping them he gestured with a thumb toward gurgi or will you tell me this this sorry thing is one of your charges he is no piggy indignantly retorted gurgi no piggy at all he is gurgi bold and clever to serve kindly master the creatures outburst brought only more laughter from the horsemen but now the first rider spied melynlas your steed is above your station pigkeeper he said how do you come by it melynlas is mine by right taran replied sharply a gift of gwydion prince of don lord gwydion cried the warrior given stolen from him rather he jeered have a care your lies will cost you a beating i tell no lie and seek no quarrel taran answered we journey in peace to king smoits castle smoit needs no pigkeeper one of the warriors broke in nor do we said the first rider he swung around to his fellows what say you shall we take his horse or his head or both lord goryon will welcome a fresh mount and reward us all the more for this one answered a rider but the head of a pigkeeper series no use not even to himself well said and so be it cried the warrior besides he can better mind his pigs afoot he added reaching for the stallions bridle taran sprang between melynlas and the horseman gurgi leaped forward and furiously grappled the riders leg the other warriors spurred their mounts and taran found himself in the midst of rearing horses driven from the side of his own steed he fought to bring up his sword one of the riders wheeled and drove his mounts flank heavily against taran who lost his footing at the same instant another of his assailants fetched him a blow that would surely have cost taran his head had the warrior not struck with the flat of his sword as it was taran fell stunned to the ground his ears ringing thoughts spinning and the horsemen seeming to burst into comets before his eyes he was dimly aware of gurgi frantically yelling of melynlas whinnying and it seemed to him that another figure had joined the fray by the time he could stagger to his feet the horsemen had vanished dragging melynlas with them taran crying out in dismay and anger stumbled toward the path they had taken a broad hand grasped his shoulder he turned abruptly to see a man in a sleeveless jacket of coarse wool girt with a plaited rope his bare arms were knotted and sinewy and his back bent though less by years than by labor a shock of gray uncropped hair hung about a face that was stern but not unkind hold hold the man said youll not overtake them now your horse will come to no ill the henchmen of lord goryon treat steeds better than strangers he patted the oaken staff he carried two of goryons borderband will have heads to mend but so will you from the look of you he picked up a sack and slung it over his shoulder i am aeddan son of aedd he said come both of you my farm is no distance without melynlas my quest will fail taran cried i must find he stopped short the warriors mockery still rankled him and he was reluctant to tell more than need be even to this man who had befriended him but the farmer showed no interest in questioning him what you seek replied aeddan is more your business than mine i saw five set upon two and only put some fairness in the match will you heal your hurt then follow me so saying the farmer set off down the hillside taran and gurgi behind him gurgi turned often to shake his fist in the direction of the departed horsemen while taran trudged along the darkening path speaking not a word deep in despair over melynlas and thinking bitterly that in his quest he had done no more than lose his horse and gain a broken head his bones ached his muscles throbbed to worsen matters the clouds had thickened nightfall brought pelting rain and by the time he reached aeddans farmhold taran was as drenched and bedraggled as ever he had been in all his life the dwelling into which aeddan led the companions was only a hut of wattle and daub but taran was surprised at its snugness and neat furnishings never before in all his adventures had he shared hospitality with the farmer folk of prydain and he glanced around as wondering as a stranger in a new land now that he could look more closely at aeddan he sensed honesty and good nature in the mans weathered face the farmer gave him a warm grin and taran despite the smart of his wounds grinned back feeling indeed that he had come upon a friend the farm wife a tall workhardened woman with features as lined as her husbands threw up her hands at the sight of gurgi whose dripping matted hair had gathered a blanket of twigs and pine needles and cried out at tarans bloodsmeared face while aeddan told of the fray the woman alarca opened a wooden chest and drew out a sturdy warm jacket well worn but lovingly mended which taran gratefully took in place of his own sodden garment alarca set about mixing a potion of healing herbs and aeddan meantime poured onto a table the contents of his sack hunches of bread a cheese and some dried fruit you come to small comfort he said my land yields little so i toil part of my days in my neighbors fields to earn what i can not grow and yet taran said dismayed to learn aeddans plight i have heard it told there was rich soil in the valley cantrevs was indeed replied aeddan with a dour laugh in the time of my forefathers not in mine as the hill cantrevs were famed for their longfleeced sheep so the valley cantrevs of ystrad were known far and wide for the finest oats and barley and cantrev cadiffor itself for wheat bright and heavy as gold and golden days there must have been in all prydain aeddan went on cutting the bread and cheese into portions and handing them to taran and gurgi my fathers father told a tale already old when it was told to him of plows that worked of themselves of scythes that reaped a harvest without even the touch of a mans hand so too have i heard taran said but arawn deathlord stole those treasures and now they lie unused and hidden deep in the fastness of annuvin the farmer nodded arawns hand chokes the life from prydain his shadow blights the land our toil grows heavier and all the more because our skills are few enchanted tools did arawn steal many secrets there were of making the earth yield richly and of these too the lord of annuvin robbed us twice in two years have my crops failed aeddan went on as taran listened with heartfelt concern my granary is empty and the more i must toil for others the less i may work my own fields even so my knowledge is too slight what i most need is locked forever in the treasure hoard of annuvin it is not altogether your skill that lacks alarca said putting a hand on the farmers knotted shoulder before the first planting the plow ox and cow sickened and died and the second her voice lowered for the second we were without the help of amren taran glanced questioningly at the woman whose eyes had clouded she said amren our son he was of your years and it is his jacket you wear he needs it no longer winter and summer are alike to him he sleeps under a burial mound among other fallen warriors yes he is gone the woman added he rode with the battle host when they fought off raiders who sought to plunder us i share your sorrow taran said then to console her added but he died with honor your son is a hero my son is slain the woman answered sharply the raiders fought because they were starving we because we had scarcely more than they and at the end all had less than when they began now for us the labor is too great for one pair of hands even for two the secrets arawn deathlord stole could well serve us alas we can not regain them no matter even without the secrets my harvest will not fail this year aeddan said all save one of my fields lies fallow but in this one have i spent all my toil he looked proudly at taran when my wife and i could no longer pull the plow ourselves i broke the earth with my own hands and sowed it grain by grain the farmer laughed yes and weeded it blade by blade as niggling as a granddam with her favorite patch of herbs it will not fail indeed it must not he added frowning this season our livelihood hangs on it little more was said then and when the meager meal ended taran gladly stretched his aching bones besides the hearth while gurgi curled up next to him weariness overcame even his despair for melynlas and with the patter of rain on the thatch and the hiss of the dying embers taran soon fell asleep the companions woke before first light but taran found aeddan already working in his field the rain had stopped leaving the earth fresh and moist taran knelt and took up a handful aeddan had spoken the truth the soil had been tilled with utmost pains and taran watched the farmer with growing respect and admiration the farm could indeed yield richly and taran stood a moment looking toward the fallow ground barren for lack of hands to labor it with a sigh he turned quickly away his thoughts once more on melynlas how he might regain the silvermaned stallion taran could not foresee but he had determined to make his way to the stronghold of lord goryon where in aeddans judgment the warriors had surely taken the animal though more than ever anxious over his beloved steed taran worked through the morning beside aeddan the farm couple had kept scarcely a morsel of the evenings fare for themselves and taran saw no other means to repay them by midday however he dared delay no longer and made ready to take his leave alarca had come to the door of the hut like her husband the woman had asked nothing beyond what little taran had chosen to tell of his quest but now she said will you still follow your own path have you turned from home and kinsmen what mothers heart longs for her son as i long for mine alas none that i know taran answered folding amrens jacket and gently putting it in her hands and none that knows me you have been well taught in the ways of farming aeddan said if you seek a place of welcome you have already found one whatever other welcomes i find may they be as openhearted as yours taran replied and it was not without regret that he and gurgi said farewell chapter goryon and gast aeddan had point out the shortest path to lord goryons stronghold and the two wayfarers reached it by midafternoon it was not a castle taran saw but a large huddle of buildings circled by a barricade of wooden stakes lashed with osier and chinked up with hardpacked earth the gate of heavy palings stood open and there was much going and coming of horsemen of warriors on foot of herdsmen driving in their cows from pasture though gurgi was far from eager taran led on keeping as bold a face as he could and amid the busy crowd the two entered the stronghold unnoticed and unchallenged without difficulty taran found the stables which were larger cleaner and in better repair than the rest of the buildings and strode quickly to a young boy raking straw calling out in a firm voice tell me friend is there not a gray stallion here that lord goryons warriors captured a handsome steed they say and a rare one gray stallion cried the stable boy gray dragon rather the beast halfkicked his stall down and gave me a bite ill not forget lord goryon will have broken bones before the day ends how then taran hurriedly asked what has he done with the steed what has the steed done with him answered the boy grinning thrown him the most of a dozen times already the master of horse himself can not sit three moments on the creatures back but goryon tries to ride it even now goryon the valorous he is called the boy chuckled then added behind his hand though to my mind he has little stomach for this task but his henchmen egg him on and so goryon means to break the beast to his will even if he must first break its back master master gurgi whispered frantically hasten to king smoit for helpings tarans face had paled at the boys words caer cadarn was too far smoits help would come too late where is the steed he asked hiding his concern this would be a sight worth the seeing the stable boy pointed his rake toward a long lowroofed building in the training field behind the great hall but take heed he added rubbing his shoulder keep your distance or the beast will give you worse than he gave me setting off instantly taran no sooner passed the great hall than he heard shouting and the furious whinny of melynlas his pace quickened into a run a grassless hoofbeaten turf was ahead he glimpsed warriors circling the gray stallion who reared bucked and spun about with heels flying in another moment the burly thickset figure atop the stallions back was flung loose then arms and legs flailing lord goryon plummeted to earth and lay there like a sack of lead melynlas galloped desperately seeking escape from the circle of warriors one of whom hastened to snatch at the horses reins all caution forgotten taran cried out and raced to the stallions side he grasped the bridle before the surprised man could think of drawing his sword and threw his arms about the neck of melynlas who whickered in greeting the other onlookers ran toward taran as he strove to mount and pull gurgi up after him a hand seized his jacket taran fought free and set his back against the stallions flank lord goryon had meanwhile picked himself up and now burst through the press of warriors insolence impudence roared goryon his dark grayshot beard bristled like a furious hedgehog his heavy face was mottled purple whether from bruises lack of breath blind anger or all three at once taran could not judge does a churl lay hand on my horse away with him thrash him soundly for his insult i do no more than claim my own steed taran cried melynlas foal of melyngar a tall rawboned man with one arm bound up in a sling whom taran guessed to be the master of horse peered sharply at him foal of melyngar prince gwydions war horse that is noble lineage how do you know this i know it as well as i know melynlas was stolen from me taran declared near aeddans farmhold at the borders of your cantrev and my comrade robbed of his pony he tried then to explain who he was and the purpose of his journey but the cantrev lord unheeding broke in angrily impudence cried goryon his beard bristling all the more furiously how dares a pigkeeper insult me with a liars tale my borderband gained these mounts nearly at the cost of their lives the cost of our lives taran retorted glancing hurriedly at the faces around him where are the riders i beg you call them to witness more insolence snapped the cantrev lord they ride the borders as they are commanded do you mean to tell me i keep idle men and shirkers in my service and full service have they given you one of the warriors said to goryon heroes all of them to stand against six giants giants repeated taran scarcely believing his ears giants indeed cried goryon it will not be forgotten how the brave riders of goryon the valorous were beset by enemies outnumbered two to one by worse than giants for one was a fierce monster with sharp claws and fangs another carried an oak tree in his fist and swept it about him as if it were no more than a twig but the riders of goryon overcame them all with glory and honor the stallion too was bewitched put in another of goryons henchmen and fought as fiercely as the giants the beast is a mankiller vicious as a starving wolf but goryon the valorous will tame the creature added another turning to the cantrev lord youll ride the brute will you not goryon eh said goryon a painful and unhappy grimace suddenly marking his face so i will so i will he growled then flung out angrily you insult my honor if you think i can not as taran stood among these rough warriors he began to despair of finding any means of convincing the pricklytempered cantrev lord the thought crossed his mind to draw blade and fight his way out as best he could but another glance at the stern faces of the henchmen gave him only more cause for dismay my lord taran said firmly i speak the truth there were no giants but my companion and myself and a farmer who fought beside us no giants shouted goryon but more insults he stamped his foot as if the turf itself had given him some impertinence you call my men liars as well call me one my lord taran began again bowing deeply for it was growing clear to him that goryons touchy honor could scarcely allow the cantrev lord to believe an account of simple horse stealing and there was taran realized even for the borderband themselves considerably more honor in overcoming giants than in robbing assistant pigkeepers i call no man liar and your men spoke the truth the truth he added as they saw it insolence cried goryon the truth as it is there were giants monsters uprooted oaks my men were wellrewarded for their valor but you shall have a beating for your impudence what i believe my lord is this taran went on choosing his words carefully since all he had thus far managed to say goryon had turned into one kind of insult or another the sun was low and our shadows made our number seem twice as great indeed your men saw double what we truly were as for giants taran hurried on before the cantrev lord could cry out against another impertinence again the long shadows of sunset gave us such height that any man could mistake our size the oaktree cudgel lord goryon began the farmer bore a stout oaken staff taran said his arm was strong his blows quick as two of your men had good reason to know he smote with such a mighty hand small wonder they felt a tree had fallen on them lord goryon said nothing for a moment but sucked a tooth and rubbed his bristling beard what of the monster a raving ferocious creature they saw with their own eyes the monster stands before you taran answered pointing to gurgi he has long been my companion i know him to be gentle but the fiercest foe when roused he is gurgi yes yes gurgi shouted bold clever and fierce to fight for kindly master with this he bared his teeth shook his hairy arms and yelled so frightfully that goryon and his henchmen drew backward a pace the face of the cantrev lord had begun to furrow in deep perplexity he shifted his bulk from one foot to another and glared at taran shadows he growled you mean to shadow the bravery of those who serve me another insult if your warriors believed they had seen what they claimed taran said and fought accordingly their bravery is no less indeed he added half under his breath it is every bit as great as their truthfulness these are no more than words interrupted the master of horse show me deeds there is no creature on four hooves that i can not ride save this one you churl will you dare to mount for answer taran swung quickly into the saddle melynlas whinnied pawed the ground then stood calmly lord goryon choked with amazement and the master of horse stared in disbelief a surprised murmur rose from goryons henchmen but taran heard a rough laugh as one of them called so ho goryon a lout rides a steed a lord has not mastered and takes your horse and honor both taran thought he had seen a faint flicker of relief in goryons bruised face as though he were not altogether displeased to avoid riding melynlas but at the henchmans words the cantrev lords features began to darken furiously not so taran hastily cried out to the circle of men would you have your liege lord ride a pigkeepers nag is that fitting to his honor he turned now to goryon for a bold thought had come to him and yet my lord were you to take him as a gift from me what shouted goryon at the top of his voice his face turning livid insults impertinence insolence how dare you i take no gifts from pigkeepers nor will i lower myself to mount the beast again he flung up an arm begone out of my sight your nag your monster and his pony along with you goryon snapped his jaws shut and said no more gurgis pony was led from the stable and under the eyes of the cantrev lord and his henchmen the two companions passed unhindered through the gate taran rode slowly head high with all the assurance he could muster but once out of sight of the stronghold the companions clapped heels into their horses flanks and galloped for dear life oh wisdom that wins horses from prideful lord gurgi cried when they had ridden far enough to be safe from any change of heart on the part of goryon even gurgi could not have been so clever oh he wishes to be wise as kindly master but his poor tender head has no skill in such thinkings my wisdom taran laughed barely enough to make up for losing melynlas in the first place he scanned the valley anxiously night was falling and he had hoped by this time to have come upon a farmhold where they might shelter for the encounter with goryons borderband had given him no wish to learn what others might be roving the hills but he saw neither cottage nor hut and so pressed on through the purpling dusk lights flared in a clearing ahead and taran reined melynlas to a halt near a stronghold much like lord goryons but here torches blazed at every corner of the palisade from sockets set high on either side of the gate even at the rooftree of the great hall as if in token of feasting and revelry within dare we stop here taran said if this cantrev lord shows us goryons courtesy wed sleep sounder in a gwythaints nest nevertheless the hope of a comfortable bed and the torches inviting glow made his weariness weigh all the heavier he hesitated a moment then urged melynlas closer to the gate to the men in the watchtower taran called out that here were wayfarers journeying to caer cadarn and known to king smoit he was relieved when the portal creaked open and the guards beckoned the pair to enter the chief steward was summoned and he led taran and gurgi to the great hall beg hospitality of my lord gast the steward told them and he will grant what he deems fitting as he followed the steward tarans spirits rose at the thought of a warm meal and a comfortable couch loud voices laughter and the merry notes of a harp came from the hall stepping through the doorway taran saw crowded tables on either side of a lowceilinged room at the far end flanked by his henchmen and their ladies sat a richly garbed war lord a drinking horn in one fist and most of a joint of meat in the other taran and gurgi bowed deeply before they could draw closer the harper standing in the middle of the hall turned cried out in surprise and ran to them taran whose hand was being shaken half off his arm found himself blinking with happy astonishment at the long pointed nose and spiky yellow hair of his old companion fflewddur fflam well met the two of you cried the bard pulling them to the high table ive missed you ever since we parted did you not stay at caer dallben when we sailed from mona fflewddur hurriedly explained i really meant to leave off wandering and settle down in my own realm then i said to myself fflewddur old fellow springs only once a year and here it is and here am i but what of yourselves first food and drink and your tidings later fflewddur had brought the companions to stand before lord gast and taran saw a heavyfeatured warrior with a beard the color of muddy flax a handsome collarpiece dangled from his neck rings glittered on fingers stout enough to crack walnuts and bands of beaten silver circled his arms the cantrev lords raiment was costly and wellcut but taran saw it bore the spots and spatters not only of this feast but of many others long past the bard with a sweep of his harp named the companions to lord gast these are two who sought the black cauldron from arawn of annuvin and fought at the side of gwydion prince of don let your hospitality match their boldness and so it shall gast loudly cried no wayfarer can fault the hospitality of gast the generous he made place for the companions at his table and sweeping aside the empty bowls and dishes before him clapped his hands and bawled for the steward when the servitor arrived lord gast commanded him to bring such an array of food and drink that taran could hardly imagine himself eating half of it gurgi hungry as always smacked his lips in gleeful anticipation as the steward left lord gast took up a tale whose matter taran found difficult to follow concerning the costliness of his food and his openhandedness toward travelers taran listened courteously through it all surprised and delighted at his good luck in finding gasts stronghold feeling more at ease thanks to the presence of fflewddur taran at last ventured to speak of his meeting with lord goryon goryon snorted gast arrogant boor crude lout braggart and boaster to boast of what he snatched up a drinking horn see this he cried the name of gast carved upon it and the letters worked in gold see this cup this bowl these ornament my common table my storehouse holds even finer as you shall see goryon horseflesh is all he knows and little enough of that fflewddur meanwhile had raised the harp to his shoulder and began to strike up a tune its a small thing i composed myself he explained though i must say its been cheered and praised by thousands no sooner were the words past his lips than the harp bent like an overdrawn bow and a string broke with a loud twang drat the thing muttered the bard will it give me no peace i swear its getting worse the slightest bit of color added to the facts and it costs me a string yes as i meant to say i know full halfadozen who deemed the song ah rather well done with deftness born of long sad practice fflewddur knotted up the broken string taran glancing around the hall this while was surprised to realize the plates and drinking horns of the guests were more than halfempty and in fact showed no sign of ever having been full his perplexity grew when the steward returned to set the foodladen tray before lord gast who planted his elbows on either side of it eat your fill cried gast to taran and gurgi pushing a small hunch of gravyspotted bread toward them and keeping the rest for himself gast the generous is ever openhanded a sad fault that may turn me into a pauper but its my mature to be free with all my goods i cant fight against it generous taran murmured under his breath to fflewddur while gurgi swallowing the skimpy fare looked hopelessly around for more i think hed make a miser seem a prodigal in comparison so passed the meal with gast loudly urging the companions to stuff themselves yet all the while grudgingly offering them no more than a few morsels of stringy meat from the heaped platter only at the end when gast has swallowed all he could and his head nodded sleepily and his beard straggled into his drinking horn were the companions able to down the meager leavings at last disheartened and with bellies still hollow the three groped their way to a meanly furnished chamber where they nevertheless dropped into sleep like stones in the morning taran was impatient to start once more for caer cadarn and fflewddur agreed to ride with him but lord gast would hear none of it until the companions marveled at his storerooms the cantrev lord flung open chests of goblets ornaments weapons horse trappings and many things taran judged of high value but in such a muddled heap that he could scarcely tell one from another among all these goods tarans eyes lingered on a gracefully fashioned wine bowl the most beautiful taran had ever seen he had however little chance to admire it for the cantrev lord quickly thrust a garishly ornamented horse bridle into tarans hands and as quickly replaced it with a pair of stirrups which he praised equally that wine bowl is worth all the rest put together fflewddur whispered to taran as lord gast now led the three companions from the storehouse to a large cow pen just outside the barricade i recognize the work from the hand of annlaw clayshaper a master craftsman the most skilled potter in prydain i swear his wheel is enchanted poor gast fflewddur added to count himself rich and know so little of what he owns but how has he gained such treasure taran said on that score i should hesitate to ask fflewddur murmured with a grin very likely the same way goryon gained your horse and this cried the cantrev lord halting beside a black cow who stood peacefully grazing amid the rest of the herd and this is cornillo the forest cow in all the land taran could not gainsay the words of the cantrev lord for cornillo shone as if she had been polished and her short curving horns sparkled in the sun lord gast proudly stroked the animals sleek flanks gentle as a lamb strong as an ox swift as a horse and wise as an owl gast went on while cornillo calmly munching her cud turned patient eyes to taran as though hoping not to be mistaken for anything other than a cow she leads my cattle declared lord gast better than any herdsman can shell pull a plow or turn a grist mill if need be her calves are always twins as for milk she gives the sweetest cream every drop so rich the dairy maids can scarcely churn it cornillo blew out her breath almost in a sigh switched her tail and went back to grazing from the pasture lord gast pressed the companions to the hen roost and from there to the hawk mews and the morning was halfspent and taran had begun to despair of ever leaving the stronghold when gast finally ordered their mounts readied fflewddur taran saw still rode llyan the huge goldentawny cat who had saved the companions lives on the isle of mona yes i decided to keep her rather shes decided to keep me said the bard as llyan recognizing taran padded forward and began happily rubbing her head against his shoulder she loves the harp more than ever fflewddur went on cant hear enough of it no sooner did he say this than llyan flicked her long whiskers and turned to give the bard a forceful nudge so that fflewddur then and there had to unsling his instrument and strike a few chords while llyan purring loudly blinked fondly at him with great yellow eyes farewell called the cantrev lord as the companions mounted at the stronghold of gast the generous youll ever find an openhanded welcome its a generosity that could starve us to death taran laughing remarked to the bard as they rode eastward again gust thinks himself openhanded as goryon thinks himself valorous and as far as i can judge neither one has the truth of it yet he added they both seem pleased with themselves indeed is a man truly what he sees himself to be only if what he sees is true answered fflewddur if theres too great a difference between his own opinion and the facts ah then my friend i should say that such a man had no more substance to him than goryons giants but dont judge them too harshly the bard went on these cantrev nobles are much alike prickly as porcupines one moment and friendly as puppies the next they all hoard their possessions yet they can be generous to a fault if the mood strikes them as for valor theyre no cowards death rides in the saddle with them and they count it nothing and in battle ive seen them gladly lay down their lives for a comrade at the same time he added its also been my experience in all my wanderings that the further from the deed the greater it grows and the most glorious battle is the one longest past so its hardly surprising how many heroes you run into had they harps like mine said fflewddur warily glancing at his instrument what a din youd hear from every stronghold in prydain chapter a matter of cows late that afternoon the companions sighted the crimson banner of the house of smoit its black bear emblem flying bravely above the towers of caer cadarn unlike the palisaded strongholds of the cantrev lords smoits castle was a fortress with walls of hewn stone and ironstudded gates thick enough to withstand all attack the chips in the stones and the dents in the portal told taran the castle had indeed thrown back not a few assaults for the three travelers however the gates were flung open willingly and an honor guard of spearmen hastened to escort the companions the redbearded king sat at the dining table in his great hall and from the array of dishes platters and drinking horns both full and empty taran judged smoit could scarcely have left off eating since morning seeing the companions the king leaped from his throne of oakwood fashioned in the shape of a gigantic bear looking much like smoit himself my body and bones smoit roared so loudly the dishes rattled on the table its better than a feast to see all of you his battlescarred face beamed with delight and he flung his burly arms around the companions in a jointcracking hug scrape out a tune from that old pot of yours he cried to fflewddur a merry tune for a merry meeting and you my lad he went on seizing tarans shoulders with his heavy redfurred hands when last we met you looked scrawny as a plucked chicken and your shaggy friend what has he rolled in the bushes all the way from caer dallben smoit clapped his hands shouted for more food and drink and would hear nothing of tarans news until the companions had eaten and the king had downed another full meal the mirror of llunet said smoit when taran at last was able to tell of his quest ive heard of no such thing as well seek a needle in a haystack as a looking glass in the llawgadarn mountains the kings heavy brow furrowed and he shook his head the llawgadarns rise in the land of the free commots and whether the folk there will be of a mind to help you the free commots taran asked ive heard them named but know little else about them theyre hamlets and small villages fflewddur put in they start to the east of the hill cantrevs and spread as far as great avren ive never journeyed there myself the free commots are a bit far even for my ramblings but the land itself is the pleasantest in prydain fair hills and dales rich soil to farm and sweet grass for grazing theres iron for good blades gold and silver for fine ornaments annlaw clayshaper is said to dwell among the commot folk as do many other craftsmen master weavers metalsmiths from time out of mind their skills have been the commots pride a proud folk they are said smoit and a stiffnecked breed they bow to no cantrev lords but only to the high king math himself no cantrev lords asked taran puzzled who then rules them why they rule themselves answered smoit strong and steadfast they are too and by my beard im sure theres more peace and neighborliness in the free commots than anywhere else in prydain and so what need have they for kings or lords when you come to the meat of it he added a kings strength lies in the will of those he rules taran who had been listening closely to these words of smoit nodded his head i had not thought of it thus he said half to himself indeed true allegiance is only given willingly enough talk cried smoit it hurts my head and dries my gullet lets have more meat and drink forget the mirror tarry with me in my cantrev lad well ride to the hunt feast and make merry youll put more flesh on your bones here than scrambling about on a fools errand and that my boy is good counsel to you nevertheless when he finally saw that taran would not be dissuaded smoit goodnaturedly agreed to give the companions all they needed for the journey next morning after a huge breakfast which smoit declared would serve to whet their appetites for dinner the king threw open his storehouse to them and went with them to be sure they chose the best of gear taran had only begun sorting through coils of rope saddlebags and harness leather when one of the castle guards burst into the storeroom calling sire a horseman of lord gast is come raiders from lord goryons stronghold have stolen gasts prize cow and the rest of the herd with her my pulse roared smoit my breath and blood the kings tangled bush of eyebrows knotted and his face turned as red as his beard how does he dare stir trouble in my cantrev the men of gast have armed they ride against goryon the guard hastened on gast craves your help will you speak to his messenger speak to him bellowed smoit ill clap his master in irons for breaking the peace and worse for breaking it without my leave put gast in irons taran asked with some perplexity but gorybn stole his cow his cow cried smoit his cow indeed gast stole her from goryon himself last year and before that the other way around neither of them knows whose beast it rightly is those two brawlers have ever been at loggerheads now the warm weather heats their blood again but ill cool their tempers in my dungeon gast and goryon both smoit snatched up a mighty doubleedged battle axe ill fetch them back by the ears he roared they know my dungeons theyve been there often enough who rides with me i will cried fflewddur his eyes lighting up great belin a fflam never shuns a fight if you ask our help sire taran began we give it willingly but mount up then my lad shouted smoit youll see justice done and ill have peace between gast and goryon if i have to break their heads to gain it swinging his battle axe smoit bolted from the storeroom bellowing orders right and left a dozen warriors sprang to horse smoit leaped astride a tall barrelchested steed whistled through his teeth almost loudly enough to break them and waved his men onward amid the shouting and confusion taran bewildered found himself atop melynlas galloping across the courtyard and out the castle gate the redbearded king set such a pace through the valleys that it put even llyan on her mettle to keep up while gurgi with most of the wind pounded out of him clung to the neck of his frantically galloping pony smoits war horse was in a lather and so was melynlas before the cantrev king signaled a halt to meat smoit cried swinging out of the saddle and looking as unwearied as if he had just begun a mornings trot the companions still catching their breath had by no means found their appetites but smoit clapped his hands to the heavy bronze belt around his middle hunger makes a man gloomy and saps all the spirit from a battle sire must we battle with lord gast taran asked with some concern for smoits war band numbered only the dozen who had ridden from caer cadarn and if lord goryons men have armed we may be too few to stand against all of them battle smoit retorted no mores the pity ill have those troublemakers by the nose and into my dungeons before nightfall theyll do as i command im their king by my beard theres brawn enough here he added shaking a mighty fist to make them remember it and yet taran ventured to say you yourself told me a kings true strength lay in the will of those he ruled hows that cried smoit who had settled his bulk against a tree trunk and was about to attack the joint of meat he had pulled from his saddlebag dont puzzle me with my own words my body and bones a king is a king i meant only that youve locked gast and goryon in your dungeon many times before taran answered and still they quarrel is there no way to keep peace between them or make them understand ill reason them reasons bellowed smoit clutching his battle axe he knitted his jutting brows but true enough it is he admitted frowning and seeming to chew at the thought as if it were gristle in his meat they go surly to the dungeon and surly leave it youve struck on something my lad the dungeons useless against that pair and my pulse i know why it needs more dampness more draught so be it ill have the place well watered down tonight taran was about to remark that his own thought was otherwise but fflewddur called out and pointed to a horseman galloping across the meadow he wears the colors of goryon shouted smoit jumping to his feet still holding the joint in one hand and the battle axe in the other two of the warriors quickly mounted and drawing swords spurred to engage the rider but the horseman brandishing his weapon hilt downward cried out that he bore tidings from the cantrev lord you rogue smoit bellowed dropping both meat and axe and collaring the rider to haul him bodily from the saddle what other mischiefs afoot speak give me your news man or ill have it out of you along with your gizzard sire gasped the messenger lord gast attacks in strength my lord goryon is hardpressed he has ordered more of his warriors to arm and calls on you to help him as well what of the cows cried smoit has gast won them back does goryon still hold them neither sire answered the messenger as well as he could with smoit shaking him between every word lord gast attacked lord goryon to regain his own herd and take lord goryons too but as they fought all the beasts frighted and ran off the cows sire both herds are gone lost every soul of them and cornillo herself let that be the end of it declared smoit and a good lesson for all cowrobbers gast and goryon shall cry peace and ill spare them from my dungeon sire the fighting grows hotter the messenger said urgently neither one will leave off each blames the other for loss of his herd lord goryon swears vengeance on lord gast and lord gast swears vengeance on lord goryon theyve both been itching for battle smoit burst out now they find their excuse he summoned one of his warriors ordering him to take goryons messenger to caer cadarn there to be held as hostage to horse the rest of you smoit commanded my body and bones well see sport after all he gripped his axe oh therell be heads broken today he cried with relish and his battered face brightened as if he were on his way to a feast the bards will sing of this exclaimed fflewddur carried away by smoits ardor a fflam in the thick of battle the thicker the better the harp shuddered and a string snapped in two i mean fflewddur hastily added i hope were not too badly outnumbered sire taran called as smoit strode to his war horse if gast and goryon wont stop because their herds are lost shouldnt we try to find the cows yes yes gurgi put in find cows gone with strayings and put an end to fightings and smitings but smoit had already mounted and was shouting for the war band to follow and taran could do no more than gallop after him to which stronghold smoit was leading them taran did not know as far as smoit was concerned taran decided it made little difference whether gast or goryon fell first into the kings hands in a while however taran recognized the path he and gurgi had taken from aeddans farm and he judged now that smoit would make for goryons stronghold but as they pounded across an open field the king veered sharply left and taran glimpsed a troop of mounted warriors some distance away at the sight of their banners smoit bellowed furiously and spurred his steed to overtake the horsemen but the riders themselves galloping at top speed quickly vanished into the woodland smoit reined up shouting after them and shaking his huge fist has goryon put more warriors in the fray roared smoit his face crimson then gast has done the same those louts wore his colors sire taran began if we can find the cows cows burst out smoit theres more than cows in this my lad such a brawl can spread like a spark through tinder those thickskulled ruffians will set the whole of cadiffor ablaze and next thing you know well all be at one anothers throats but by my beard theyll learn my fist smites harder than theirs smoit hesitated and his face darkened with deep concern he scowled and tugged at his beard the lords of the next cantrev he muttered theyll not stand idle but strike against us when they see were fighting each other but the cows taran urged the three of us can seek them while you the dungeon cried smoit ill have gast and goryon in it before their squabble gets further out of hand smoit clapped heels to his horse and charged forward making no attempt to hold to any pathway dashing at breakneck speed through bramble and thicket with the companions and the train of warriors pelting behind smoit clattered over the stones of a riverbank and plunged his horse into the swift current the king had ill chosen his fording place for in another moment taran found himself in water up to his saddlehorn sinoit shouting impatiently pressed on across the river taran saw the king rise up in his stirrups to beckon his followers and urge more haste but an instant later the war horse lost footing and lurched sideways steed and rider toppled with a mighty splash and before taran could spur melynlas to him smoit had been torn loose from his mount and like a barrel with arms and legs was being borne quickly downstream behind taran some of the warriors had turned back seeking to overtake the king by following along the riverbank taran closer to the opposite bank urged all strength from melynlas leaped from the saddle to dry ground and raced along the shore after smoit the sound of rushing water filled his ears and with dismay taran realized the king was being pulled relentlessly to a waterfall heart bursting in his chest taran doubled his pace though before he could set foot in the rapids he saw the kings red beard sink below the churning water and he cried out in despair as smoit vanished over the brink chapter a judgment taran scarmbled down the rocks jutting beside the high cascade in a pool hammered into white spray he could hardly make out smoits burly form spinning in the eddies heedless of the pounding water taran pitched through the falls and sprang into the pool he groped for smoits belt and seized it at last battling the whirlpool and nearly drowning himself with his own efforts taran painfully strove to drag the halfconscious king into the shallows smoit was bleeding heavily from the forehead and his ruddy face had gone chalky pale taran tugged at the kings waterlogged bulk hauling him safely from the rolling waters in another moment gurgi and fflewddur were beside him helping to drag the king ashore smoit like a beached whale collapsed on the bank gurgi moaning anxiously loosened the kings garments while taran and the bard hastily saw to smoits injuries he can count himself lucky hes only cracked his skull and half his ribs fflewddur said another man would have been snapped in two but were in a fine pickle he added under his breath to taran glancing at the warriors who had come to gather near the unconscious smoit hell not lay gast or goryon by the heels now he needs more healing than we can give wed best take him to caer cadarn taran shook his head he remembered smoits words about the neighboring cantrev lords who would seize the opportunity to attack it was in his mind too that finding cornillo could best bring gast and goryon to terms and thus end their battle but his thoughts were as tangled as orddus weaving and he fervently wished himself in the place of smoit whose unconsciousness at that moment seemed a most enviable state aeddans farmhold is closer taran said well bring him there and gurgi shall stay with him you and i must seek out gast and goryon and do what we can to stop their quarrel as for cornillo and the herd i doubt we may hope to find them the companions tearing their cloaks into strips set about binding up smoits wounds the kings eyelids fluttered and he groaned loudly give me to eat gasped smoit i may be halfdrowned but ill not be halfstarved he put a hand on tarans shoulder good lad good lad youve saved my life another moment and id have been beaten into a pudding claim any favor it is yours i ask none taran replied knotting the bandages around smoits huge chest alas he murmured what i most want none can grant no matter panted smoit what you wish of me you shall have sire you can not travel far taran began as smoit tried painfully to climb to his feet give us leave to ride with your warriors and kind master hear gurgi called excitedly hear with listenings llyan too had caught some sound for her ears cupped forward and her whiskers twitched its my gizzard calling for meat and drink cried smoit loud it must be for im empty as a drum no no shouted gurgi seizing tarans arm and drawing him past the trees along the riverside gurgi hears no thrummings and drummings but cooings and mooings leaning on the bard smoit stumbled after them gurgi had spoken the truth the creatures sharp ears had not deceived him now taran himself heard a faint lowing gurgi raced toward the sound beyond the trees the land dipped into a shady dell watered by a streamlet taran cried aloud there stood the herd grazing calmly around cornillo my pulse bellowed smoit so loudly that a dozen horned heads turned and stared as alarmed as if some strange new kind of bull had burst into their quiet pasture great belin cried fflewddur cornillos led them all to safety shes wiser than either of her masters cornillo raised her head as taran hurried to her side she blew out her breath gently and rolled her eyes in a look of longsuffering patience smoit heedless of his grievous bruises clapped his hands triumphantly and shouted at the top of his voice for his warriors sire let us drive the herd to aeddans farm taran urged your own hurts must be tended better than weve done drive them where you please lad answered smoit my body and bones we have them now that will fetch gast and goryon to me at a gallop he summoned two horsemen commanding them to bear a message to the cantrev lords tell those two troublemakers where ill await them cried smoit and tell each to call truce for his cows are found and gurgi found them shouted gurgi capering wildly yes yes bold clever sharpeared gurgi finds all that is lost oh yes he flung his hairy arms around himself and seemed close to bursting with pride and delight at his own deed oh bards will sing of clever gurgi with rantings and chantings im sure they will old friend taran said youve found the herd but dont forget we still have gast and goryon to deal with and theres only one cornillo the cows were at first reluctant to quit the dell but after much coaxing taran was able to lead cornillo along the valley pathways toward aeddans farm the others followed her lowing and tossing their horns it was a strange procession that wended its way across the meadows and rolling hillocks smoits warriors rode on either side of the herd and the redbearded king himself brandished a spear as if it were a drovers staff llyan padded after the cattle alert for strays and gurgi perched proud as a shaggy rooster on cornillos back when aeddans but came in sight taran galloped ahead calling to the farmer but he had no sooner dismounted when the door burst open and he fell back surprised aeddan stood with a rusted sword in his hand behind the farmer taran glimpsed alarca weeping into her apron is this how you repay kindness aeddan cried recognizing taran immediately his eyes blazed as he pointed the ancient weapon at the approaching war band do you come with them to spoil our land begone it is already done how then taran stammered shocked at these words from one he held to be a friend i ride with king smoit and his men we seek peace between gast and goryon does it matter whose warriors trampled my crops aeddan flung back what gast has destroyed goryon has doubly destroyed warring back and forth across my field till not a blade of wheat stands battle is their pride but my farm is my life do they seek vengeance i sought only a harvest in the weariness of despair aeddan bowed his head and cast his sword to the ground taran stared in dismay at the field where aeddan had so painfully labored the hooves of steeds had churned the earth to mud uprooting the young shoots which now lay torn to shreds the harvest on which aeddan had staked his livelihood would never come and taran felt the farmers heartbreak as if it were his own before he could speak a troop of horsemen galloped from the woods edging the farm taran recognized lord goryon at their head in another moment lord gast and his riders appeared catching sight of his rival the cantrev lord spurred his mount and galloped frantically to the cottage flung himself out of the saddle and with a furious shout raced toward goryon robber cried gast do you mean to steal cornillo from me again thief cried goryon i took what was mine to begin with liar roared gast never was she yours insults insolence roared goryon his face turning purple his hand snatching for his sword be silent bellowed smoit he shook his battle axe at the cantrev lords your king speaks how dare you quarrel and insult each other you pigheaded brawlers smoit gestured to his warriors who strode to seize gast and goryon the riders of the two war bands cried out angrily and made to unsheathe their swords for an instant taran feared another battle would rage then and there but smoits warriors stood their ground and the sight of the enraged king himself caused the horsemen to draw back submissively my dungeon will teach you to be good neighhors cried smoit youll stay there till you learn as for cornillo ive split my skull cracked my bones and ridden to the edge of starvation this day and so i claim her for myself a prize of war and small recompense it is for the vexation youve given me another day and youd have set the whole cantrev ablaze at this gast and goryon both roared in furious protest and taran could no longer hold his tongue he strode to the kings side sire even a lifetime in your dungeon will not raise one grain of wheat on a ruined field aeddan has lost all he hoped to gain one harvest to keep himself and his wife alive you offered me a favor taran went on i refused it then will you let me claim it now ask what you please my lad replied smoit it is already given taran hesitated a moment as he stepped forward and stood facing the cantrev lords then he turned to smoit i ask you this he said set gast and goryon free while smoit blinked in astonishment goryon glimpsing taran for the first time exclaimed its the pigkeeper who cozened me out of my horse i took him for a lout but he asks a noble favor grant it smoit he speaks wisdom set them free taran continued to labor beside aeddan and strive to mend what they have destroyed what cried gast i took him for a hero but hes no more than a lout how dare he ask gast the generous to delve the ground like a mole and for no reward impudence impertinence insolence shouted goryon ill not have a pigkeeper pass judgment on goryon the valorous nor on gast the generous exclaimed gast pass judgment on yourselves then taran answered picking up two handfuls of earth and torn shoots and holding them before the furious cantrev lords this is what remains of aeddans livelihood as well take a sword and slay him look on this lord goryon for there is more truth here than in your tales of giants and monsters and this he treasured lord gast more than you treasure any of your possessions and it was more truly his own for he toiled to make it so gast and goryon had fallen silent the two rough cantrev lords stared at the ground like sheepish boys aeddan and his wife looked on without speaking the lad has a better head on his shoulders than i do exclaimed smoit and his judgment is wiser kinder too for my choice would have been the dungeon not the delving the cantrev lords reluctantly nodded agreement taran turned to smoit the rest of my favor is this grant most where need is greatest do you claim cornillo for your own sire give her to aeddan give up cornillo smoit began sputtering and choking my prize of war he finally nodded his head so be it lad aeddan shall keep her taran went on and gast and goryon shall have her next calves what of my herd cried goryon and minecried gast theyre so mixed together no man can tell his own from anothers lord goryon shall divide the herds in equal portions taran said he shall not lord gast broke in hell give me all the scrawny ones and keep the fat for himself its i wholl divide them not so shouted goryon youll fob off none of your rawboned creatures on me lord goryon shall divide the herds taran repeated but lord gast shall be first to choose his half well said smoit burst out roaring with laughter my breath and blood you have them there goryon divides and gast chooses ho oho it takes two thieves to strike an honest bargain aeddan and alarca had come to stand before taran and king smoit who you may truly be i do not know the farmer said to taran but you befriended me far better than i befriended you oh wisdom of kindly master cried gurgi as the cantrev lords set about dividing their herds and smoits warriors made ready to return to caer cadarn gurgi finds cows but only wise master knows what to do with them if indeed i did rightly taran replied gast and goryon will be waiting for cornillos calves gast said they were always twins i only hope he added with a grin that she doesnt disappoint us it was long after nightfall when the companions at last reached caer cadarn fflewddur and gurgi were too exhausted to do more than fling themselves onto their couches taran would gladly have followed them but smoit took his arm and drew him to the great hall count your day well spent my lad cried smoit youve spared the cantrev from a war and me from being drubbed into jelly as for gast and goryon how long theyll stay at peace with each other ill not guess but youve taught me one thing my dungeons are useless my body and bones ill have them walled up directly from this day ill try my hand at speaking instead of smiting and yet lad smoit went on furrowing his brow my wits are slow i need no man to tell me that and i am easier in my mind when i have a blade in my hand will you return favor for favor stay with me in cantrev cadiffor sire taran answered i seek to learn who my kinsmen are i can not kinsmen shouted smoit slapping his great girth theres enough of me to make all the kinsmen you could want hear me well he added his voice quieter now a widower am i and childless do you yearn for parents no less do i yearn for a son when the horn of gwyn the hunter sounds for me there shall be none to take my place and none would i choose but you stay lad and you shall one day be king of cadiffor king of cadiffor taran cried his heart leaped what need to seek the mirror when he could offer eilonwy a royal throne the proudest gift he could ever lay at her feet taran king of cadiffor the words rang more sweetly in his ears than taran assistant pigkeeper yet suddenly his joy turned cold while eilonwy might honor his rank could she respect him for abandoning his quest even before it had begun could he respect himself for a long while taran did not answer then with fond admiration he turned his eyes to smoit the honor you would give me taran began there is nothing i would value more highly yes i long to accept it his voice faltered yet i would rather hold kingship by right of noble birth not as a gift it may be he went on slowly that in truth i am nobly born if it should prove thus then gladly would i rule cadiffor how then cried smoit my body and bones id rather see a wise pigkeeper on my throne than a blood prince whos a fool but there is this as well taran answered it is in my heart to learn the truth about myself i will not stop short of it were i to do so who i truly am would forever be unknown and through all my life i would feel a part of me lacking at these words smoits battlescarred face fell with sadness and regretfully he bowed his head but after a moment he clapped taran heartily on the back my breath blood and beard he cried youve a will to chase the wild goose willothewisp lookingglass or whatever it may be and ill say no more to keep you from it seek it out lad whether or not you find it come back and cadiffor will welcome you but hasten for if gast and goryon are ever at loggerheads again ill not vouch for how much of the cantrev will be left thus taran with gurgi and fflewddur fflam set off once more in his secret heart taran cherished the hope he might return to smoits realm with proud tidings of his parentage yet he did not foresee how long it would be until he set foot in cantrev cadiffor again chapter a frog from caer cadarn the companions made good progress and within a few days crossed the ystrad river where fflewddur led them for a time along the farther bank before turning northeastward through the hill cantrevs unlike the valley cantrevs these lands were grayish and flinty what might once have been fair pastureland taran saw to be overlaid with brush and the long reaches of forest were closegrown and darkly tangled fflewddur admitted his roving seldom brought him to these parts the cantrev nobles are as glum as their domains play your merriest tune and the best you can hope for is a sour smile yet if the old lore is true these realms were as rich as any in prydain the sheep of the hill cantrevs great belin its said they had fleece so thick you could sink your arm in it up to the elbow nowadays alas they tend to be a little scruffy aeddan told me arawn deathlord stole many secrets from the farmers of the valley taran replied surely he robbed the shepherds of the hill cantrevs as well fflewddur nodded few treasures he hasnt spoiled or stolen save those of the fair folk and even arawn might think twice before trifling with them be that as it may he went on id not change the northern realms where my own kingdom is for any of these there my boy we raise no sheep but famous bards and warriors naturally the house of fflam has held its throne there for well for a remarkably long time in the veins of a fflam declared the bard flows royal blood of the sons of don prince gwydion himself is my kinsman distant distant its true he added hastily but a kinsman nonetheless gurgi does not care for famous sheep or fleecy bards gurgi wistfully murmured he is happy at caer dallben oh yes and wishes he is soon there as for that answered fflewddur im afraid youll have hard travel before you see home again its anyones guess how long it will take to find your mysterious mirror ill go with you as far as i can he said to taran though sooner or later i shall have to get back to my kingdom my subjects are always impatient for my return the harp shuddered violently as a string snapped in two fflewddurs face reddened ahem he said yes what i meant was ill be anxious to see them again the truth of it is i often have the feeling they manage quite well even when im not there still a fflam is dutiful the companions halted while fflewddur slid from llyans back and squatted on the turf to repair his broken string from his jacket the bard took the large key which he used to tighten the harps wooden pegs and began patiently retuning the instrument a raucous cry made taran glance quickly skyward its kaw he exclaimed pointing to the winged shape plummeting swiftly toward the companions gurgi shouted joyfully and clapped his hands as the crow alighted on tarans wrist so youve found us old friend cried taran delighted to have the crow with him once again tell me he went on quickly how does eilonwy fare does she miss all of us princess kaw croaked beating his wings princess eilonwy taran he clacked his beak hopped up and down on tarans wrist and set up such a jabbering and chattering that taran could barely make out one word from another the best he could understand was that eilonwys indignation at being forced to learn royal behavior had by no means dwindled and that indeed she missed him tidings that both cheered taran and sharpened his yearning for the goldenhaired princess in the cavern on mona kaw also managed to convey glew the giant had been restored to his original size by dallbens potion kaw himself was in the best of spirits still gabbling at the top of his voice he flapped his glossy black wings hopped from tarans wrist to greet the other companions and even perched on llyans head where he busily ran his beak through the great cats tawny fur his eyes will help our search taran said to fflewddur who had left his harp to come and stroke the birds sleek feathers kaw can scout the land better than any of us so he can agreed fflewddur if he has a mind to and if you can make him heed you otherwise the scamp will have his beak in everyones business but his own yes yes gurgi added shaking a finger at the crow heed commands of kindly master help him with flyings and spyings not pryings and lyings in answer the crow impudently thrust out a sharp black tongue with a flirt of his tail he fluttered to the harp and began rapidly twanging the strings with his beak at the bards cry of protest kaw hopped from the instruments curved frame and snatched up the tuning key which he began dragging across the turf hes brazen as a magpie cried fflewddur setting off after the crow hes thieving as a jackdaw no sooner did fflewddur come within half a pace of him than kaw nimbly hopped away again bearing the key in his beak squawking merrily the crow stayed always out of fflewddurs grasp and taran could not help laughing at the sight of the longshanked bard vainly racing in circles while kaw danced ahead of him when gurgi and taran joined the pursuit and tarans fingers had come within a hairs breadth of the crows tail feathers kaw shot upwards and flapped teasingly a short distance into the woods there he lighted on the gnarled branch of a tall ancient oak and peered with bright beady eyes at the companions gathered below come down taran ordered as sternly as he could for the birds comical antics made it impossible for him to be seriously angry ive tried to teach him to behave taran sighed but its no use hell bring it back when he feels like it and not before hi hi drop it called fflewddur waving his arms drop it i say at this kaw bobbed his head hunched up his wings and dropped the key not into the bards outstretched hands but into a hollow of the tree trunk dropped it dropped it croaked kaw rocking back and forth on the branch jabbering and chuckling gleefully at his own jest fflewddur snorted that birds illmannered as a starling hes had his merriment now i shall have the toil muttering hard comments about the impudence of waggish crows the bard flung his arms about the trunk and tried to haul himself upward less than halfway his grip loosened and he came tumbling down to land heavily amid the roots a fflam is agile fflewddur panted ruefully rubbing his back great belin theres not a tree i cant climb ah except this one he mopped his brow and glared at the high trunk gurgi climbs yes yes cried gurgi springing to the oak with shaggy arrris and legs working all at once in a trice the creature clambered up the tree while fflewddur shouted encouragement gurgi thrust a skinny hand into the hollow here is tuneful key oh yes he called clever gurgi finds it he stopped short taran saw the creatures face wrinkle in surprise and perplexity tossing the key down to fflewddur gurgi turned once more to the hollow but what is this what else does gurgi find with gropings kindly master he shouted here is strange something all set away in hidings taran saw the excited creature tuck an object under his arm and slide down the oak tree see with lookings cried gurgi as taran and the bard pressed around him kaws prank was forgoften in the moment and the crow not abashed whatever flew to tarans shoulder stretched out his neck and crowded forward as if determined to be first to glimpse gurgis discovery is it treasure gurgi exclaimed oh treasure of great worth and gurgi finds it he stamped his feet wildly open it kindly master open and see what riches it holds what gurgi pressed into tarans hand was a small squat iron coffer no wider than tarans palm its curved lid was heavily hinged bound with iron strips and secured by a stout padlock is it jewels with winkings and blinkings or gold with shimmerings and glimmerings cried gurgi as taran turned the coffer over and over fflewddur too peered at it curiously well friends the bard remarked at least well have some reward for the trouble that pilfering jackdaw has given us though from the size of it i fear it shant be very much taran meantime had been struggling with the lock which refused to give way the lid resisted all his battering and finally he had to set the coffer on the ground where gurgi held it tightly while the bard and taran pried at the hinges with the points of their swords but the coffer was surprisingly strong and it took all their strength and effort before the lid at last yielded and fell away with a loud rasping snap within lay a packet of soft leather which taran carefully untied what is it what is it yelped gurgi jumping up and down on one leg let gurgi see shining treasure taran laughed and shook his head the packet held neither gold nor gems but no more than a slender piece of bone as long as tarans little finger gurgi groaned in disappointment fflewddur snorted i should say our shaggy friend has found a very small hairpin or a very large toothpick i doubt well have much use for either one taran had not ceased examining the strange object the sliver of bone was dry and brittle bleached white and highly polished whether animal or human he could not tell what value can this have he murmured frowning great value replied fflewddur if one should ever need a toothpick beyond that he shrugged keep it if you like or toss it away i cant see it would make any difference even the chest is beyond repair but if its worthless taran said still studying the bone closely why should it be so carefully locked up and so carefully hidden its been my long experience that people can be very odd about their belongings said fflewddur a favorite toothpick a family heirloom but yes i see what youre driving at a fflam is quickthinking whoever put it away didnt want it found as i was about to remark theres considerably more here than meets the eye and yet taran began a hollow tree seems hardly the safest place to keep anything on the contrary answered the bard what better way to hide something indoors it could be found without too much difficulty bury it in the ground and theres the problem of moles badgers and all such but a tree like this he continued glancing upward i doubt that anyone but gurgi could climb it without a ladder and its hardly probable that anyone strolling through this forest would be carrying a ladder with them if the birds or squirrels nest on top theyd only cover it up all the more no whoever put it there gave the matter careful thought and took as much pains as if fflewddurs face paled as if he swallowed hard choking on his own words get rid of it he whispered urgently forget we ever found the thing i can sniff enchantment a mile away toothpick hairpin or what have you theres something queer about it he shuddered as ive said time and time again dont meddle you know my mind on that score two things never mix one is enchantments and the other is meddling with them taran did not answer immediately but stared for a time at the polished fragment at last he said whatever it may be its not ours to take yet if there is enchantment good or evil dare we leave it away with it cried fflewddur if its good theres no harm done if its evil theres no telling what beastly thing might happen put it back by all means taran reluctantly nodded wrapping the bone once more he replaced it in the coffer set the broken lid loosely on top and asked gurgi to return it to the hollow gurgi who had been listening closely to fflewddurs talk of enchantment was loath even to touch the coffer and only after much urging and pleading by the companions did he agree to do so he hastily climbed the oak and scuttled down even faster than he had clambered up and good riddance to it muttered fflewddur striding as quickly as he could from the forest taran and gurgi after him the latter casting fearful backward glances until the oak was well out of sight the companions returned to their steeds and prepared to mount fflewddur picked up his harp looked about him and called i say wheres llyan dont tell me shes wandered off tarans alarm quickly changed to reassurance for a moment later he saw the huge cat plunge from the underbrush and lope to fflewddur who clapped his hands and made loud whispering noises through his teeth sa sa so there you are old girl cried the bard beaming happily as llyan frisked about him now what have you been after i think shes caught a why yes shes caught a frog taran exclaimed catching sight of a pair of long legs with webbed feet dangling from llyans mouth yes yes put in gurgi a froggie a froggie with thumpings and jumpings i should hardly think so said the bard weve seen no swamps or pools and very little water at all for the matter of that proudly purring llyan dropped her burden at fflewddurs feet it was indeed a frog and the biggest taran had ever seen the bard after patting llyans head and fondly rubbing her ears knelt and with a certain squeamishness picked up the motionless creature yes well im delighted old girl he said holding it at arms length between his thumb and forefinger its lovely i dont know how to thank you she often does this he explained to taran i dont mean dead frogs necessarily but odds and ends an occasional mouse that sort of thing little gifts she fancies i might enjoy a sign of affection i always make a fuss over them its the thought after all that counts taran curious took the frog from the bards hand llyan he saw had carried the creature gently and had in no way harmed it instead the frog had suffered from lack of water its skin splotched in green and yellow was sadly parched its legs feebly splayed its webbed toes had begun to curl and wither like dry leaves and its great bulging eyes were tightly shut regretfully taran was about to return the creature to the bushes when the faint tremor of a heartbeat touched his palm fflewddur the poor things alive taran said there may still be time to save him the bard shook his head i doubt it hes too much the worse for wear a shame for hes a jollylooking fellow give poor froggie a drink gurgi suggested give him water with sloshings and washings in tarans hand the frog stirred as in a last painful effort one eye flickered the wide mouth gaped and its throat trembled like a faint pulse arrad croaked the frog i say there is life in him yet exclaimed fflewddur but he must be desperately sick ive never heard a frog make a noise like that urgghi the frog croaked ood the creature was struggling to make a further sound but its croaking dwindled to a hoarse and scarcely audible rasping elpp elpp he is an odd one remarked fflewddur as taran more puzzled than ever held the frog close to his ear the creature had forced its eyes open and stared at taran with what seemed a most pitiful pleading expression ive known them to go chugachug continued fflewddur and at times thonk but this fellow if frogs could talk id swear he was saying help taran gestured the bard to silence from deep in the frogs throat came another sound hardly more than a whisper but clear and unmistakable tarans jaw fell his eyes wide with bewilderment he turned to fflewddur barely able to speak he held the frog in his outstretched hand and gasped its doli chapter friends in danger doli echoed the astonished bard falling back a pace his eyes bulged like the frogs and he clapped his hands to his head it cant be not doli of the fair folk not good old doli gurgi had just then come up with a leather water flask and hearing fflewddurs words began yelping in terror and dismay taran took the flask from gurgis trembling hand unstoppered it and with all haste began drenching the frog oh terrible oh horrible moaned gurgi unlucky doli unhappy dwarfish companion but how did this froggie swallow him with gulpings under the stream of water the frog had begun to revive and now kicked mightily with its long hind legs skin skin came dolis voice pour it on my skin not down my throat you clot are you trying to drown me great belin murmured fflewddur at first i thought it was just a frog who happened to have the same name as doli but id know that temper anywhere doli taran cried is it really you of course it is you longlegged beanpole snapped dolis voice just because i look like a frog on the outside doesnt mean im not myself on the inside tarans head spun at the thought of doli in this form gurgi was speechless his eyes as round and wide open as his mouth fflewddur as stunned as the other companions had recovered somewhat from his first shock and now dropped to his hands and knees on the damp turf where taran had set the frog youve chosen a strange way to travel about said fflewddur did you weary of turning yourself invisible i can understand how that might be tiresome but a frog though you do make a handsome one i remarked on it the moment i saw you the frog rolled up his eyes in utter exasperation and his greenspotted body began to swell as if it might burst chosen do you think i chose this im bewitched you ninny cant you see that tarans heart skipped a beat who bewitched you he cried aghast at the weird fate which had befallen his old companion was it orddu shes threatened us before did you too journey to the marshes idiot numbskull retorted doli ive better sense than to trifle with her who then has done this to you taran exclaimed how can we help dallben surely has power against such enchantment have courage well take you to him no time doli answered i dont know if dallben can break the spell i dont even know if king eiddileg of the fair folk can do it right now it doesnt matter if you want to help me doli went on dig a hole and put some water in it im dry as a bone and thats the worst thing that can happen to me i mean to a frog i learned that quickly enough he blinked at fflewddur if that giant cat of yours hadnt found me id be dead as a stump where did you ever get such a big one its a long story began the bard dont tell me then snapped doli as for what brings you here of all places you can explain when theres more time he settled into the muddy basin taran and fflewddur had scraped out with their swords and filled with water from the flask ah ah thats better i owe you my life ah what a relief thank you friends thank you doli we cant let you stay in this plight taran insisted tell us who cast this evil spell well find him and make him lift it at sword point if need be cried fflewddur he stopped and peered with renewed fascination at doli i say old boy whats it really like being a frog ive often wondered damp is what its like retorted doli damp clammy if i thought turning myself invisible was uncomfortable this is a hundred times worse its like oh dont boggle me with stupid questions it doesnt matter ill manage somehow theres more important work afoot yes you can help me doli quickly went on if anyone can help at all strange things have been happening so it would seem agreed the bard to say the very least fflewddur let him speak taran broke in his life may be at stake strange things doli resumed peculiar unsettling first not long ago word reached king eiddileg in our realm at the bottom of black lake that someone had plundered a fair folk treasure trove broke into it made off with the most valuable gems its rarely happened in all the history of prydain fflewddur gave a whistle of surprise knowing eiddileg i can imagine he was rather sour about it not for loss of the gems replied doli weve more than enough its that someone was able to find the trove in the first place and in the second dared to lay hands on fair folk treasure most of you mortals have better sense could it have been arawn or any of his servants taran asked i shouldnt think so put in fflewddur as i remarked only today even the lord of annuvin would be more than cautious with fair folk for once youre right doli answered no not arawn we were sure of that but we had only one report incomplete from a fair folk watcher in the hill cantrevs no tidings from the guardian of the way post here that in itself was very odd eiddileg sent a messenger to scout around and get to the root of things he never came back not a word from him eiddileg sent another same thing silence dead silence you can guess who was chosen to go next thats right good old doli anything disagreeable to be done any unpleasant task until now taran had never been aware that a frogs face could show such a look of indignation and of being much put upon doli snorted as well as he was able in his present shape naturally send for good old doli but you found who did it taran asked of course i did doli retorted but i failed in the end look at me now of all times of all the useless things to be oh if i only had my axe the fair folk are in danger he went on hurriedly terrible danger yes i learned who found our trove and stole our treasure the same who cast this spell on me morda morda taran repeated frowning who is morda how could he have done so why would he dare to risk eiddilegs wrath why why dolis eyes popped furiously and he began to swell up again dont you understand morda this foul villain of a wizard oh hes shrewder than a serpent dont you see hes found a way of bewitching fair folk no enchanter has ever been able to cast a spell on us unheard of unthinkable and if hes gained the power to turn us into animals fish frogs no matter were at his mercy he could slay us out of hand if he chose thats surely what happened to the way post guardian to the messengers who vanished without a trace it can happen to any of us to eiddileg himself not one of the fair folk can be safe from morda hes the worst threat ever to fall upon our realm doli sank back exhausted by his own outburst and the companions glanced fearfully at each other what his scheme is i couldnt discover doli continued at last oh i tracked him to his hiding place easily enough he lives in a sort of enclosure not too far from here id gone invisible needless to say but it was making my ears buzz so much worse than a pair of hornets nests in the darkness i thought i could chance turning visible just for a moment to escape that awful buzzing next thing i knew there i was as you see me now morda could have crushed me then and there instead he mocked my plight it amused him to see a helpless frog then he threw me down among the rocks he savored my lingering agony more than the mercy of killing me out of hand he was sure id perish in these dry hills withering little by little to my death and if by some chance i didnt what difference could it make how could a frog hope to prevail against a wizard i crept away trying to find water i kept on until i could go no farther your cat found me then if she hadnt i can tell you it would have been the end of me one thing morda forgot doli added one tiny thing he overlooked i could still speak i myself didnt know it at the time the shock of being turned into a frog quite took away my voice for a while great belin murmured fflewddur ive heard of people having frogs in their throats but never forgive me forgive me old boy he added quickly as doli glared at him i didnt mean to ruffle your feelings doli tell us what we must do taran cried horrorstricken at the dwarfs account it was not dolis plight alone that turned his blood cold he saw clearly the fate in store for all the fair folk lead us to morda well try to take him prisoner or slay him if we must so we shall exclaimed fflewddur drawing his sword ill not have my friends turned into frogs no no shouted gurgi froggies are froggies but friends are friends attack morda doli replied are you out of your heads youll end up in the same pickle as me no you cant risk it eiddileg must be warned but before that i must finish my task find out more of mordas powers and how he means to use them theres no hope of fair folk standing against him unless we know better what we have to deal with take me back to mordas stronghold somehow ill get to the bottom of his scheme then carry me to a way post so i can get word to eiddileg and spread the alarm a suddenspasm convulsed him for an instant doli seemed about to choke then a racking sneeze nearly flung him out of the puddle curse this dampness he sputtered curse that blackhearted morda hes given me all the bad points of being a frog and none of the good doli began coughing violently blast it dow i ab losigg by voice bake haste bake haste pick be up ill show you the way theres doe tibe to waste the companions hurriedly mounted with doli clinging to his saddle horn taran galloped where the dwarf commanded but the forest thickened and slowed their pace and often in the tangle of branches they were forced to dismount and go afoot doli had assured them the distance was not great but his usually unfailing sense of direction had grown confused at times the dwarf was uncertain which path to follow and twice the companions reined up and retraced their steps dote blade be snapped doli i cabe over this ladd crawligg odd by belly its dot the sabe seeigg it frob up here to make matters worse doli began to shake and shudder his eyes bleared his nostrils streamed and even as a frog he looked altogether miserable with constant fits of sneezing and coughing dolis voice grew so hoarse he could barely force out a feeble croaking whisper which did nothing to improve the state of his disposition or the clarity of his directions to taran until now there had been no sign of kaw when the companions had first hastened to follow dolis orders the crow had chosen this of all moments to be exasperatingly disobedient he flapped into the woods stubbornly refusing to heed tarans pleas to come back at last taran left him behind sure the crow would rejoin them when he saw fit but as the companions made their way deeper into the forest taran had grown more anxious for the impudent bird thus when they halted to set doli on the ground where the dwarf insisted he could better regain his bearings taran was too relieved to scold the crow when kaw finally appeared the prankster taran saw had been up to his old tricks for he bore some glittering find in his beak squawking proudly kaw dropped the object into the surprised tarans hands it was the fragment of polished bone what have you done taran cried in dismay as kaw overweeningly pleased with himself rocked back and forth and bobbed his head the jackanapes burst out fflewddur hes gone back and rifled the coffer i thought us well rid of that enchanted toothpick now weve got it again a sour jest you magpie he exclaimed flapping his cloak at the bird who nimbly dodged away a fflam is funloving but i see no joke in this at all throw it away he urged taran toss it into the bushes i dare not if indeed its a thing of enchantment taran replied though he felt as uneasy as the bard and heartily wished kaw had left the coffer undisturbed a strange thought vague and unformed stirred in his mind and he knelt holding out the fragment to doli what can this be he asked after briefly telling how the sliver had first come into their hands could morda himself have hidden it who dose croaked doli ive dever seed eddythigg like it but its edchadded you cad be sure keep it id eddy case keep it cried the bard well have nothing but ill luck from the cursed thing bury it swayed by fflewddurs vehemence yet reluctant not to follow dolis counsel taran stood uncertain what to do at last with strong misgivings he tucked the fragment into his jacket fflewddur groaned meddling well only gain trouble mark my words a fflam is fearless but not when theres unknown enchantment lurking in someones pocket as they pressed on taran shortly came to believe he had decided wrongly and that fflewddurs unhappy prediction was wellfounded doli had taken a turn for the worse he could gasp no more than a word or two at a time the frogs body trembled as in the grip of a painful ague a sickness taran was sure owing to dolis grueling crawl overland to keep his skin from parching the companions drenched him regularly while the treatment on the one hand kept him alive on the other it added to his misery under the stream of water he sneezed choked and sputtered soon he sprawled listlessly too feeble even to be badtempered the day had waned quickly and the companions halted in a glade for doli had given them to understand that from now on they must travel with utmost caution setting the frog carefully in the folds of a dampened cloak taran drew fflewddur aside and spoke hurriedly with him he has no strength for his task taran murmured we dare not let him go on fflewddur nodded i doubt he could even if he wanted to the bards face like tarans was drawn tightly with concern taran was silent what he must do was plain to him yet despite himself he shrank from facing it his mind groped for another better plan but found none returning always to the same answer what kept him from taking the clear course was not reluctance to help a close companion for this he would have done gladly nor was it fear for his life but terror that he might share dolis fate not only that his own quest would fail but that he might himself be imprisoned hapless in some pitful creature shape captive forever he knelt at dolis side you must stay here fflewddur and gurgi will watch over you tell me how i may find morda chapter the walls of thorns hearing this doli kicked weakly and croaked an incomprehensible protest though nothing else could he do but agree to tarans plan with kaw on his shoulder taran set off afoot through the woods behind him loped gurgi who had insisted on going with him after a time taran shortened his stride and finally halted to glance around him at the forest now thick with brambles high thorn bushes rose amid the trees in a tangled impassable screen taran realized he had found what he sought the tall bushes were no haphazard growth but had been craftily twined into a dense barrier a living wall nearly twice his height bristling with spines sharper than the talons of a gwythaint taran drew his sword and strove to cut an opening in the thicket the brambles were hard as cold iron and taran blunted both his strength and his blade against them all he gained for his labor was a tiny hole to which he pressed his eye he made out nothing more than a dark mound of boulders and black turf surrounded by rank weeds and burdock what first seemed the lair of a wild beast he saw to be a rambling illshaped dwelling of low squat walls roofed with sod there was no movement no sign of life and he wondered if the wizard had left his fastness and the companions had come too late the thought only put a sharper edge to his uneasiness somehow doli forced his way in taran murmured shaking his head but his skill is greater than mine he must have struck on an easier passage if we try climbing over taran added we risk being seen or caught on brambles with jabbings and stabbings gurgi replied oh bold gurgi does not like climbing walls without knowing what lies in lurkings beyond taran took the crow from his shoulder morda surely has his own passage a breach in the thorns or perhaps a tunnel find it for us he said urgently to kaw find it for us old friend and hasten too gurgi put in no jokings and trickings silent as an owl the crow flew upward circled the barrier then dropped out of sight taran and gurgi crouched waiting in the shadows after some while when the sun had dipped below the trees and dusk had gathered with still no tidings from kaw taran began to fear for the bird prankster though he was kaw understood the seriousness of his mission and taran knew it was more than whim that delayed the crows return at last taran dared wait no longer he strode to the barrier and carefully began to climb the branches writhed like serpents and tore viciously at his hands and face wherever he sought a foothold the thorns turned against him as with a will of their own just below he heard gurgi panting as the sharp points struck through the creatures matted hair taran paused to catch his breath while gurgi clambered up beside him the top of the wall was almost within reach with a sudden lashing and rattling among the thorns a slipnoose tightened around tarans upraised arm he shouted in alarm and in that instant glimpsed the terrified face of gurgi as loops of finely knotted cords whipped over the creatures body a bent sapling sprang upright pulling the ropes with it taran felt himself ripped from the brambles and dangling on the end of the strong cord flung upward and over the barrier now he understood the words doli had striven to gasp out traps and snares he fell and darkness swallowed him a bony hand gripped his throat in his ears rasped a voice like a dagger drawn across a stone who are you it repeated who are you taran struggled to pull away then realized his hands were bound behind him gurgi whimpered miserably tarans head spun the guttering light of a candle stabbed his eyes as his sight cleared he saw a gaunt face the color of dry clay eyes glittering like cold crystals deep set in a jutting brow as though at the bottom of a well the skull was hairless the mouth a livid scar stitched with wrinkles how have you come here demanded morda what do you seek of me in the dimness taran could make out little more than a lowceilinged chamber and a fireless hearth filled with dead ashes he himself had been propped in the angle of a low wall gurgi lay sprawled on the flagstones beside him he glimpsed kaw pinioned in a wicker basket set on a heavy oaken table and he cried out to the bird what then snapped the wizard is this crow yours he found one of my snares as you did none enters here without my knowledge this much have you already learned now it is i who shall learn more of you yes the bird is mine taran answered in a bold voice deciding his only hope lay in telling as much of the truth as he dared he flew beyond the thicket and did not return to us we feared some mishap and went in search of him we journey to the llawgadarn mountains you have no cause to hinder us you have hindered yourselves replied morda foolish creatures without the wits of a fly to the llawgadarn mountains you say perhaps perhaps not in the race of men is much greed and envy but of truth little your face speaks for you and calls you liar what do you hope to hide no matter your paltry store of days you call life is spun out you shall not leave here and yet now you are in my hands it may be that you shall serve me i must ponder that your lives indeed may have some small use to me if not to yourselves more than the wizards words filled taran with horror as he watched unable to take his own eyes away taran saw that mordas gaze was unblinking even in the candle flame the shriveled eyelids never closed mordas cold stare never wavered the wizard straightened and drew the grimy threadbare robe closer about his wasted body taran gasped for from mordas withered neck hung a silver chain and crescent moon only one other he knew wore such an ornament princess eilonwy daughter of angharad unlike eilonwys the horns of this crescent held a strangely carved gem clear as water whose facets sparkled as though lit by an inner fire the emblem of the house of llyr taran cried morda started and drew back with fingers lean as spiders legs he clutched at the gem fool he hissed did you think to gain this from me is that why you were sent yes yes he muttered so it must be his bloodless lips twitched faintly as he fixed taran with his unlidded eyes too late the princess angharad is long dead and all its secrets are mine taran stared at him bewildered to hear the name angharad daughter of regat he whispered eilonwy never knew her mothers fate but it was you at your hands he burst out at your hands she met her death morda said nothing for a time seeming as one gripped by a black dream when he spoke his voice was heavy with hatred think you the life or death of one of you feeble creatures should concern me i have seen enough of the human kind and have judged them for what they are lower than beasts blind and witless quarrelsome caught up in their own small cares they are eaten by pride and senseless striving they lie cheat and betray one another yes i was born among the race of men a human he spat the word scornfully but long have i known it is not my destiny to be one with them and long have i dwelt apart from their bickerings and jealousies their little losses and their little gains deep in their shrunken sockets the wizards eyes glittered as i would not debase myself to share their lives neither would i share their deaths alone i studied the arts of enchantment from the ancient lore i learned the fair folk held certain gems hidden in their secret troves he who possessed one gained life far longer than any mortals mayfly span of days none had found these treasure troves and few had even dared to search yet i knew that i would learn the means to find them as for her who called herself angharad of llyr the wizard continued of a winters night she begged refuge in my dwelling claiming her infant daughter had been stolen that she had journeyed long in search of her the wizards lips twisted as if her fate or the fate of a girl child mattered to me for food and shelter she offered me the trinket she wore at her throat i had no need to bargain it was already mine for too weak was she too fevered to keep it from me if i chose to take it she did not live out the night in loathing taran turned his face away you took her life as surely as if you put a dagger in her heart mordas sharp bitter laugh was like dry sticks breaking i did not ask her to come here her life was worth no more to me than the book of empty pages i found among her possessions though in its way the book proved to be not without some small value in time a whining weakling found his way to me glew was his name and he sought to make an enchanter of himself little fool he beseeched me to sell him a magic spell an amulet a secret word of power sniveling upstart it pleased me to teach him a lesson i sold him the empty book and warned him not to open it or look upon it until he had traveled far from here lest the spells vanish glew taran murmured so it was you who cheated him like all your kind answered morda his own greed and ambition cheated him not i his fate i know not nor do i care to know this much he surely learned the arts of enchantment are not bought with gold nor stolen through heartlessness and evil as you robbed the princess angharad taran flung back heartlessness evil said morda these words are toys for creatures such as you to me they mean nothing my powers have borne me beyond them the book served to make a fool taste his folly but the jewel the jewel served me as all things will do at the end the woman angharad had told me the gem would lighten burdens and ease harsh tasks and so it did though years i spent in probing its secrets until i gained mastery of its use at my command it dwindled the heaviest faggots to no more than twigs with the gems help i raised a wall of thorns as my skill grew i found the waters of a hidden spring the wizards unblinking eyes glittered triumphantly at last he whispered at last the gem led me to what i had ever sought a fair folk treasure trove this trove held none of the lifegiving stones morda went on but what matter if not here then would i find them elsewhere now all fair folk treasure mines hidden pathways all lay open to me one of the fair folk watchers came upon me then i dared not let him raise an alarm though none had ever stood against any of them i did so cried morda my jewel was more than a trinket to lighten a scullery maids toil i had grasped the heart of its power at my command this fair folk spy turned to a sightless creeping mole yes morda hissed i had gained power even beyond what i sought who now would disobey me when i held the means to make men into the weak groveling creatures they truly are did i seek only a gem the whole kingdom of the fair folk was within my grasp and all of prydain it was then i understood my true destiny the race of men at last had found its master its master taran cried aghast at mordas words you are viler than those you scorn dare you speak of greed and envy the power of angharads gem was meant to serve not enslave late or soon your life will be forfeit to your evil the glint in mordas lidless eyes flickered like a serpents tongue think you so he answered softly from beyond the chamber came a shout a sudden crashing amid the wall of thorns morda nodded curtly another fly finds my web fflewddur taran gasped as morda strode from the chamber he flung himself closer to gurgi and the two tore at each others bonds in vain for within a few moments the wizard returned halfdragging a figure he trussed securely and threw to the ground beside the companions it was as taran feared the luckless bard great belin whats happened to you whats happened to me groaned fflewddur stunned you didnt come back i went to have a look feared youd got caught somehow in those brambles the bard painfully shook his head what a jolt my neck will never be the same you shouldnt have followed us taran whispered i had no way to warn you what of doli safe enough replied fflewddur safer at least than we are now morda had been intently watching the companions so it was the fair folk who sent you to spy on me you are leagued with the dwarfish creature foolish enough to think he could escape me so be it did i think to spare you you will share his fate yes doli of the fair folk is our companion taran cried unloose him from your spell i warn you harm none of us your plan will fail morda i am taran of caer dallben and we are under the protection of dallben himself dallben spat morda graybearded dotard his powers can not shield you now even dallben will bow before me and do my bidding as for you he added i will not slay you that would be paltry punishment you will live as long as you are able to live in the shapes you will soon have live and know during every moment of your wretched days the cost of defying me morda took the jewel and chain from about his neck and turned to fflewddur let your boldness in seeking your fellows now be cowardice flee at the barking of hounds or the tread of hunters crouch in fear at the flutter of a leaf and the passing of every shadow the gem flashed blindingly mordas hand shot forward taran heard fflewddur cry out but the bards voice died in his throat gurgi screamed and taran horrorstricken saw the bard no longer at his side kicking frantically in mordas grasp was a duncolored hare with a harsh laugh morda held the animal aloft and stared scornfully at it a moment before flinging it into a wicker basket near kaws cage the wizard strode to the companions and stood above gurgi whose eyes rolled in terror and who could only gibber wordlessly taran struggled against his bonds morda raised the gem this creature said the wizard this halfbrute serves no use feeble cringing beast be weaker still and prey to owls and serpents with all his strength taran fought to break the thongs holding him you destroy us morda he shouted but your own evil will destroy you even as taran cried these words the gem flashed once again where gurgi had lain a gray field mouse reared on its hind legs then fled squeaking to a corner of the chamber morda turned his unlidded eyes on taran chapter the hand of morda and you said morda your doom will not be to lose yourself in forest or burrow my plan fail here shall you stay prisoner and see my triumph but what shape shall i give you a dog whining for scraps from my table a caged eagle eating out his heart for the freedom of the skies angharads gem dangled from mordas fingers despair choked taran as he stared at the ornament like a bird fascinated by a serpent he envied the wretched gurgi and fflewddur a hawks talons or a foxs jaws would shortly put a merciful finish to their days his own would wear themselves out in the slow agony of captivity like stone grinding against stone until morda was pleased to end them the wizards taunts burned like drops of venom but as morda spoke taran felt a furry body press against his bound wrists startled he almost cried out his heart leaped and pounded it was the mouse that had once been gurgi heedless of its plight the creature had scurried noiselessly on tiny paws to the corner where taran lay unseen by the wizard the mouse flung himself on tarans bonds and with his sharp teeth began hurriedly gnawing at the thongs morda as if undecided toyed with the jewel gurgi taran felt was chewing desperately at the stubborn bonds time pressed and despite the creatures brave efforts the thongs held fast taran strove to draw the leather taut to aid the frantic mouse but there was no sign of loosening and now the wizard raised the glittering gem hold taran cried if my fate is to be a beast grant me this much let me choose which it must be morda paused choose his bloodless lips tightened in a scornful smile what can your wishes matter to me and yet perhaps it would be fitting if you chose your own prison speak he commanded quickly at caer dallben taran began speaking as slowly as he dared i was assistant pigkeeper in my charge was a white pig at his wrists one strand parted but gurgis strength had begun to ebb what then interrupted morda laughing harshly do you crave to be a swine to wallow in mire and grub for acorns yes pigkeeper your choice indeed is fitting it is my only wish said taran for it may at least remind me of a happier time morda nodded yes and for that very reason your wish will not be granted clever pigkeeper he jeered you have told me what you most desire now i may be all the more sure you will not have it will you not give me the shape i ask taran replied another strand gave way as gurgi fighting weariness redoubled his efforts suddenly the thongs yielded tarans hands burst free then taran cried then i will keep my own in the instant taran sprang to his feet he snatched his blade from its sheath and lunged toward the wizard who startled had taken a backward pace before morda could raise the gem with a shout taran drove his sword full into the wizards breast he plucked the weapon free but his shout turned to a cry of horror and he stumbled back against the wall morda stood unharmed his gaze never faltered the wizards mocking laughter rang through the chamber foolish pigkeeper had i feared your sword i would have taken it from you the wizard held angharads gem aloft tarans head spun with fresh terror in mordas grasp the jewel gleamed coldly in the sudden clarity of his fear taran saw the sharp facets of the crystal and the bony claw that held it he was aware now for the first time that the hand of morda lacked a little finger in its place was an ugly stump of scarred and withered flesh do you seek my life hissed morda seek then pigkeeper my life is not prisoned in my body no it is far from here beyond the reach of death itself one last power did i gain said the wizard as my jewel could shape the lives of mortal men so could it shield my own i have drawn out my very life hidden it safely where none shall ever find it would you slay me your hope is useless as the sword you hold now pigkeeper suffer for your defiance hound or eagle would be too proud a fate crawl in the darkness of earth least of all creatures a spineless limbless blind worm light flared in the heart of the gem tarans sword dropped from his grasp and he flung his arm across his face he staggered as though a thunderbolt had struck him yet he did not fall his body was still unchanged still his own what blocks my spell cried morda in a terrible voice a shadow of fear crossed his face as if i struggled against myself his lidless eyes stared unbelieving at taran and his hand with its lacking finger gripped the gem more tightly in tarans mind a strange thought raced the wizards life safely hidden where none would find it taran could not take his eyes from mordas hand a little finger the coffer in the hollow tree slowly terrified lest his hope betray him taran thrust a hand into his jacket and drew out the fragment of polished bone at the sight of it mordas face seemed to crumble in decay his jaw dropped his lips trembled and his voice came in a rasping whisper what do you hold pigkeeper give it into my hands give it i command you it is a small thing my companions and i found replied taran how should this have worth to you morda with all your power do you covet such a trifle a sickly sweat had begun to pearl on the wizards brow his features twitched and his voice took on a gentleness all the more horrible coming from his lips bold lad to stand against me he murmured i did no more than test your courage to see if you were worthy to serve me worthy of rich rewards you shall have gold in proof of my friendship and in proof of yours you shall give me the small thing the trifle you hold in your hand this worthless shard taran answered will you have it for a token then let us share it half for me and half for you no no do not break it screamed morda his face turning ashen he thrust out a skinny claw and took a step toward taran who quickly drew back and raised the fragment of bone above his head a worthless thing it is taran cried your life morda your life i hold in my hand mordas eyes rolled madly in their wasted sockets a violent shudder gripped him and his body quaked as though buffeted by a gale yes yes he cried in a voice racked with terror my life poured into my finger with a knife i cut it from my own hand give give it back to me you set yourself above the human kind taran replied you scorned their weakness despised their frailty and could not see yourself as one of them even i without birthright or name of my own know that if nothing else i am of the race of men kill me not cried morda writhing in anguish my life is yours take it not from me the wizard flung himself to his knees and stretched out his trembling arms his bloodless lips quivered as the words burst from his mouth hear me hear me many secrets are mine many enchantments i will teach them to you all all mordas hands clasped and unclasped his fingers knotted around each other and he rocked back and forth at tarans feet his voice had taken on a wheedling whining tone i will serve you serve you well master pigkeeper all my knowledge all my powers at your bidding angharads jewel dangled from its silver chain at mordas wrist and he clutched it and held it up before taran this even this the gem is not yours to give taran answered not mine to give master pigkeeper the wizards voice grew soft and sly not mine to give but yours to take would you know its secret workings i alone can tell you would you gain mastery of its use have you never dreamed of power such as this here it awaits you the race of men at your beck and call who would dare disobey your smallest wish who would not tremble in fear of your displeasure promise me my life master pigkeeper and i shall promise you do you bargain with enchantment you stole and corrupted taran cried angrily let its secrets die with you at this morda howled horribly and pressed himself almost flat on the ground barking sobs racked his body my life spare it spare it do not give me to death take the gem change me to the lowest crawling thing to foulest vermin only let me live the sight of the cowering wizard turned taran sick at heart and for a long moment he could not speak at last he said i will not kill you morda the wizard left off his frightful sobbing and lifted his head you will not master pigkeeper he crept forward and made as though to fling his arms about tarans feet i will not kill you repeated taran drawing back in revulsion though it is in my heart to do so your evil is too deep for me to judge your punishment restore my companions he commanded then you will go prisoner with me to dallben he alone can give whatever justice you may hope for stand wizard cast angharads jewel from you morda still crouching slowly and reluctantly pulled the chain from his wrist his pasty cheeks trembled as he fondled the winking gem murmuring and muttering to himself suddenly he leaped upright and sprang forward with all his might he swung the jewel at the end of its chain like a whip across tarans face the sharp edges of the stone slashed tarans forehead with a cry he stumbled backward blood streamed into his eyes blinding him the shard of bone flew from his fingers and went spinning and skittering over the floor under the force of the wizards blow the jewel snapped from its silver chain and rolled into a corner in another moment the wizard was upon him growling and snarling like a mad beast mordas fingers clawed at tarans throat his yellow teeth were bared in a ghastly grin taran strove to tear himself from the wizards grasp but the frenzy of mordas attack staggered him he lost his footing and tumbled to earth uselessly he sought to break the deadly grip that stifled him his head whirled through bloodfilled eyes he glimpsed the wizards face twisted in hate and fury your strength will not save you morda hissed it is no match for mine you are weak as all your kind did i not warn you my life is not in my body strong as death am i so shall you die pigkeeper with sudden horror taran knew the wizard spoke the truth mordas wasted arms were hard as gnarled branches and though taran struggled desperately the wizards relentless grip tightened tarans lungs heaved to bursting and he felt himself drowning in a black sea mordas features blurred only the wizards baleful unlidded gaze stayed fixed a crash of splintering wood shattered in tarans ears mordas grip suddenly slackened shouting in alarm and rage the wizard leaped to his feet and spun about his head still reeling taran clutched at the wall and tried to draw himself up llyan had burst into the chamber growling fiercely her eyes blazing gold fires the huge cat sprang forward morda turned to meet her attack llyan beware of him taran cried the force of llyans charge bore the wizard to his knees but morda in his unyielding strength grappled with the animal llyan flung her tawny body right and left her powerful hind legs their claws unsheathed lashed vainly at the wizard who twisted from her paws and now clung to her arching back yowling and spitting the great cat tossed her head furiously her sharp teeth flashed in her massive jaws yet with all her might she could not free herself from the wizards clutches taran knew even llyans strength would soon ebb just as his own had failed she had given him a moment more of life but now llyan herself was doomed the bone taran dropped to hands and knees seeking the shard nowhere did he see it he flung aside wooden stools upturned earthen vessels scrabbled in the ashes of the hearth the bone had vanished from behind him rose a high twittering and squeaking and he spun to see the mouse bobbing frantically on its hind legs in its jaws the creature held the splinter of bone instantly taran caught up the polished fragment to snap it between his fingers he gasped in dismay the bone would not break chapter the broken spell the polished splinter was unyielding as iron teeth clenched and muscles trembling with his effort taran felt he struggled against the wizard himself llyan had dropped weakly to her haunches morda sprang free of the unconscious cat and set upon taran once more snatching at the fragment the wizards fingers locked on the middle of the shard but taran clung with all his strength to the ends of it he felt the splinter bend as morda strove to wrest it from his grasp suddenly the bone snapped in two a sound sharper than a thunderclap split tarans ears with a horrible scream that stabbed through the chamber morda toppled backward stiffened clawed the air then fell to the ground like a pile of broken twigs that same instant the mouse vanished gurgi stood at tarans side kind master saves us he yelled flinging his arms about taran yes yes gurgi is gurgi again no more a mouse with shriekings and squeakings in tarans hand the sundered bone had turned to gray dust which he cast aside too exhausted and bewildered to speak he could only pat gurgi fondly and gratefully llyan her deep chest heaving climbed to her feet near mordas broken lifeless form her tawny fur still bristled furiously and her long tail looked twice its thickness as gurgi hastened to unloose kaw who jabbered at the top of his voice and beat his wings excitedly against the cage llyans golden eyes darted about the chamber and from her throat rose an anxious questioning trill great belin came fflewddurs voice im trapped as badly as before llyan loping ahead of him taran ran to a corner of the chamber the basket in which morda imprisoned the hare now held the bard squeezed into it along with his harp and stuck fast with his long shanks dangling over one side and his arms flapping helplessly over the other with some difficulty taran and gurgi set about freeing the bard who hardly left off stammering incoherently all the while fflewddurs face was ashen from fright he blinked shook his ragged yellow head and heaved huge sighs of relief what humiliation he burst out a fflam turned into a rabbit i felt id been stuffed in a woolsack great belin my nose still twitches never again i told you no good comes from meddling though in this case taran old friend its lucky you had that bone ah ah easy there that wickers jabbing me a rabbit indeed if i could only have got my paws i mean hands on that foul morda at last out of the basket fflewddur threw his arms around llyans powerful neck and you old girl if you hadnt come looking for us he shuddered and clapped hands to his ears yes well lets not think of that in the doorway stood a short stocky stoutly booted figure dressed in russet leather on his head a round closefitting leather cap thumbs hooked into his belt he turned bright crimson eyes on each of the companions instead of his customary scowl a grin stretched across his broad face doli taran cried first catching sight of the dwarf its you again again snapped doli trying to make his voice as gruff as he could it always was he strode into the chamber for a moment he looked down at morda and nodded curtly so thats the way of it he said to taran i thought as much one moment i was a frog wrapped in a sopping wet cloak sure all of you had been slain and the next as you see me that cat of yours grew restless after a time doli went on turning to fflewddur she picked me up cloak and all and went off on your trail she wont let me out of her sight replied fflewddur for which he added fondly rubbing llyans ears weve all to thank her but how did she get through the thorns taran asked mordas traps through answered doli she didnt go through she went over he shook his head in one bound with me in her mouth ive never seen a creature jump so high on the other hand ive never seen a creature like this but what of the rest of you what of morda if you dont mind fflewddur interrupted before taran could finish telling the dwarf of their ordeal i suggest leaving here immediately a fflam is steadfast but theres something about enchantments even broken ones that tends to ah disturb me wait cried taran the jewel where is it as doli watched puzzled the companions hastily set about searching every corner of the chamber to no avail tarans concern mounted for he was reluctant to leave the gem unfound however when almost ready to admit the jewel was hopelessly lost he heard a raucous laugh above his head kaw perched on an oaken rafter rocked back and forth chuckling and squawking delighted with himself the jewel glittered in his beak hi hi shouted fflewddur alarmed give it up great belin youll have us all with paws and tails again after much coaxing by taran and indignant retorts by the bard kaw flapped to tarans shoulder and dropped the gem in his hand now it belongs to wise and kindly master gurgi exclaimed gurgi fears stone of winkings and blinkings but not when kindly master holds it doli peered at the gem as taran held it up so thats how morda meant to enslave us i should have guessed this comes from the fair folk realm he added we always honored the house of llyr and gave the stone to princess regat as our wedding gift she must have handed it down to her daughter and when angharad vanished the jewel vanished with her and now it comes to my hands taran said he cupped the gem in his palm watching the play of light in the depths of the crystal morda has turned a thing of usefulness and beauty to evil ends whether it may ever serve its true purpose again i do not know to speak truth it draws me and frightens me too its power is vast too vast perhaps for any man to hold even if i could learn its secrets i would not choose to do so he smiled at gurgi do you call me wise at least im wise enough to know ill never have wisdom enough to use it still it may serve one purpose taran went on with this to bargain orddu will surely tell me who i am yes he cried this is a treasure she wont refuse he stopped abruptly and paused a long moment in his grasp lay means to gain the knowledge he craved but his heart sank though he had won the gem fairly never could he claim to be its rightful owner it was his to bargain with no more than it had been mordas if orddu accepted it and if he should learn he was of noble birth was a royal robe enough to hide a dishonorable deed he looked at doli the gem is mine taran said but only mine to give not mine to keep slowly he pressed the jewel into dolis hand take this it belonged once to the fair folk it belongs to them once more the dwarfs usual scowl softened youve done us a service he answered very likely the greatest service any of you mortals have done for the fair folk without your help morda could have destroyed us all yes the gem must return to our realm its too dangerous in other hands you chose well king eiddileg will ever remember you for this you have his thanks and mine doli nodded with satisfaction and tucked the stone carefully into his jacket its made a long journey at last it comes back to us yes yes shouted gurgi take it for keepings if kindly master will not have it then gurgi wants to see no more of wicked stone away with it away do not let it turn faithful gurgi to a mouse again taran with a fond laugh put a hand on gurgis shoulder morda couldnt have changed what you truly are any more than he could have changed doli mouse though you might have seemed you still had the heart of a lion but what of me he murmured thoughtfully as a caged eagle as a blind worm could i indeed have stayed myself would i still have been taran when i scarcely know who taran is the sun had begun to climb promising a day blue and fresh when the companions left the wizards fastness the wall of thorns had fallen shattered like the evil power that raised it and the companions breached it without difficulty they untethered melynlas and gurgis pony but it was not until they had gone a considerable distance that fflewddur agreed to halt and rest even then the bard appeared uncomfortable and while gurgi opened the wallet of food fflewddur sat distractedly on a hummock meditatively fingering his ears as though to make certain they were indeed his own rabbits the bard murmured ill never chase another taran sat apart with doli for there was much he had to tell and much he wanted to ask though doli had regained his long frown and short patience the occasional flicker of a grin betrayed his delight at seeing the companions again yet learning of tarans quest doli scowled more deeply than usual the free commots said the dwarf were on the best of terms with the commot folk they respect us and we respect them youll not find many in prydain to match their stout hearts and good will and no man lords it over his fellows because he had the luck to be born in a kings castle instead of a farmers hut what matters in the free commots is the skill in a mans hands not the blood in his veins but i can tell you no more than that for we have few dealings with them oh we keep a way post open here and there just in case they might need our help but it seldom happens the commot folk would rather count on themselves and they do quite well at it so were more than pleased for our own sake as well as theirs for we have burden enough keeping an eye on the rest of prydain as for the mirror you speak of doli continued never heard of it theres a lake of llunet in the llawgadarn mountains more than that i cant tell you but what have you there the dwarf suddenly asked noticing tarans battle horn for the first time where did you get that eilonwy gave it to me when i left mona taran replied it was her pledge that we he smiled sadly how long ago it seems he unslung the horn from his shoulder and handed it to doli thats fair folk craftsmanship said the dwarf cant mistake it to tarans surprise doli squinted into one end then the other and raised the horn into the sunlight as though trying to peer through the mouthpiece as taran watched puzzled doli rapped the horn sharply with his knuckles and thumped it against his knee empty the dwarf grumbled all used up no hold on a moment he pressed the bell of the horn against his ear and listened intently theres one left no more than that one what cried taran more than ever perplexed at dolis words one call what did you think snapped doli fflewddur and gurgi had come closer drawn by dolis odd behavior and the dwarf turned to them this was crafted long ago when men and fair folk lived in closer friendship and each was glad to help the other the horn holds a summons to us i dont understand began taran if youd listen to me you would retorted doli handing back the battle horn and i mean listen hard he pursed his lips and whistled three long notes of a pitch and sequence strange to taran hear that sound those notes on the horn just so mind you and no other way theyll bring you the nearest fair folk who will do whatever they can if you need help now do you remember the tune doli whistled the notes again taran nodded and unthinkingly raised the horn to his lips not now you clot shouted doli keep it in your head i told you there was only one summons save it dont waste it someday your life may hang on that call taran stared in wonder at the horn eilonwy herself knew nothing of this youve done me a priceless favor doli favor snorted the dwarf no favor at all the horn serves whoever happens to have it in this case you ive done nothing but show you how to gain a little more use from something already yours favor humph its only common courtesy but guard it well squander it like a fool at the first whiff of danger and youll regret it when you really are in trouble ahem fflewddur whispered to taran my own counsel to you is trust your wits your sword or your legs enchantment is enchantment and if youd been through what ive been through youd want no part of it he frowned uneasily at the battle horn and turned away ill never be the same thats sure he muttered nervously patting his ears great belin they still feel twice as long as before chapter dorath after eating the companions stretched themselves on the turf and slept solidly the rest of the day and all that night in the morning doli took his leave of them kaw at dolis request had already begun flying to the fair folk realm with tidings that all was well from there the crow would rejoin taran id go with you if i could the dwarf said to taran the thought of an assistant pigkeeper blundering his way through the llawgadarn mountains makes my hair stand on end but i dare not eiddileg must have the jewel safely and whos to bring it to him good old doli humph it saddens me to part with you taran said but youve helped me more than i could hope the lake of llunet bears the same name as the mirror and perhaps will lead me to it farewell then said doli youve kept us all from being frogs or worse and restored a treasure to us youll not regret it we fair folk have long memories the dwarf clasped hands with the travelers and pulled his leather cap tighter on his head doli waved one last time and taran watched the dwarfs stumpy figure trudging steadily across a broad meadow growing smaller in the distance until he vanished into the skirting woods and taran saw him no more through the day the companions bore northeastward again taran would have been glad for dolis guidance and keenly missed the gruff dwarf but his spirits had never been higher he rode eagerly lightheartedly the battle horn swinging from his shoulder gave him fresh courage and confidence eilonwys gift is more precious even than i thought he told fflewddur im grateful to doli for telling me its power and more than that for telling me of the lake of llunet its a strange thing fflewddur taran went on but somehow i feel closer to the end of my quest i believe more than ever that ill find what im looking for eh hows that fflewddur answered blinking as if he had just come awake though gurgi had put all thoughts of morda behind him the bard seemed still shaken by his ordeal and often lapsed into thoughtful silence when he would morosely finger his ears as though expecting them to lengthen at any moment dreadful experience he muttered now a fflam into a rabbit what were you saying the quest yes of course smell with whiffings interrupted gurgi someone cooks tasty crunchings and munchings youre right fflewddur agreed sniffing the air oh blast there goes my nose twitching again taran reined melynlas to a walk llyan too had caught the scent her ears forward she licked hungrily at her whiskers shall we see who it is asked fflewddur i wouldnt say no to a hot meal so long as it isnt rabbit taran nodded and the companions rode cautiously through the glade he had meant to catch a first glimpse of the strangers without himself being seen but he had gone no more than a few paces when two roughly bearded men rose from the shadows of the bushes taran started the two evidently posted as guards quickly drew their swords one of the men whistled a bird call and stared sharply at the companions but made no attempt to hinder them in the clearing taran saw some dozen men sprawled around a cook fire where collops of meat hung sizzling on a spit though armed heavily as warriors the men wore neither the badge nor colors of any cantrev lord some were chewing at their food some sharpening their blades or waxing their bowstrings closest to the fire stretched at his ease a heavyfaced man leaned on one elbow and toyed with a long dagger which he tossed and twirled catching it first by the hilt then by the point he wore a horsehide jacket whose sleeves had been ripped out his muddy boots were thicksoled and studded with iron nails his yellowish hair fell below his shoulders his cold blue eyes seemed to measure the three companions with an unhurried glance welcome lordships he drawled as taran dismounted what lucky wind blows you to the camp of dorath i am no lord replied taran i am taran assistant pigkeeper no lord dorath interrupted in mock surprise a halfsmile on his mouth if you hadnt told me id never have guessed these are my comrades taran went on vexed that he had let dorath make sport of him gurgi fflewddur fflam he wanders as a bard of the harp but in his own land he is a king and dorath is king wherever he rides answered the yellowhaired man laughing now lord swineherd will you share humble fare with his dagger he gestured toward the roasting collops eat your fill doraths company never goes short of commons then well want to know more about three such as you the harper rides a strange steed dorath called a man with a badly scarred face i wager my mare could stand against the beast no matter for shes an eviltempered brute and a killer born would it not be a merry match what say you dorath will you have the cat show us some sport hold your tongue gloff dorath answered carefully eyeing llyan youre a fool and always were he pulled the meat from the spit and thrust it toward the companions fflewddur having assured himself the roast was not rabbit ate with a good will gurgi as usual needed no urging to finish his meal and taran was glad to swallow his own share washed down with a mouthful of harshtasting wine dorath poured from a leather flask the sun was dropping quickly one of the band flung more branches on the fire dorath stuck his dagger into the ground before him and looked up sharply at taran and so lord said dorath have you no travelers tales to pass the time for my friends and me where do you come from where do you go and why the hill cantrevs are dangerous unless a man knows what hes about taran did not answer immediately doraths tone and the look of the men around the fire made taran guard his words we journey northward through the llawgadarn mountains dorath grinned at him and where then he asked or do you call my questions discourteous to the lake of llunet taran answered with some reluctance ive heard of treasure in those parts put in the man called gloff is that what they seek is it indeed dorath said to taran treasure he laughed loudly small wonder youre a miser with your words taran shook his head if i find what i seek it will be more to me than gold so dorath bent close to him but what would such a treasure be lord jewels finefashioned ornaments neither taran answered he hesitated then said i seek my parents dorath was quiet a moment the grin did not leave his face but when he spoke again his voice was cold when dorath asks a question he wants a truthful answer lord swineherd taran flushed angrily i have given you one say i have not and you call me liar there was a sudden silence between the two dorath had halfrisen his heavy face darkened tarans hand moved to the pommel of his sword but in that instant a merry burst of music rose from fflewddurs harp and the bard called out gently friends hear a gay tune to settle our supper he leaned the beautifully curved harp against his shoulders and as his fingers danced over the strings the men around the fire clapped their hands and urged him on dorath settled back on the turf but he glanced at the bard and spat into the fire have done harper dorath said after a time your tune jangles from that crooked pot well take our rest youll stay with us and in the morning my company will guide you to the lake of llunet taran glanced at fflewddur and caught the bards quick frown he rose to his feet we thank you for your courtesy he said to dorath but time presses and we mean to travel during the night ah yes so we do fflewddur put in while gurgi vigorously agreed as for the lake yes well we wouldnt think of putting you to the trouble its a long journey far beyond your cantrev prydain is my cantrev dorath answered have you not heard of doraths company we serve any who pay us to serve a weak lord who craves a strong war band or three wayfarers who need protection against the dangers of their journey the many dangers harper he grimly added llunet is no more than a step and a jump for my men and i know how the land lies will you go safely i ask only a little part of the treasure you seek a small reward to your humble servants we thank you taran said again it is already past nightfall and we must find our path how then cried dorath in a great show of indignation do you scorn my poor hospitality you wound my feelings lords is it beneath you to sleep beside the likes of us ah ah swineherd do not insult my men they might take it amiss indeed as dorath spoke an ugly grumble rose from the band and taran saw some of the warriors finger their swords he stood uncertain though well aware of the bards discomfort dorath watched him closely two of the men had drifted quietly to the horse lines and taran could imagine that in the shadows they were easing their weapons from their sheaths so be it taran said looking dorath squarely between the eyes we welcome your hospitality for the night and tomorrow we take leave of you dorath grinned there will be time to speak of that again sleep well sleep well muttered fflewddur as they wrapped themselves in their cloaks and uneasily stretched out on the ground great belin ill not sleep a wink i never liked the hill cantrevs and this is one reason more for liking them less he glanced around him dorath had flung himself down near the fire undoubtedly following his leaders order the man named gloff lay close by the companions i know of such roaming war bands fflewddur went on in a hushed voice ruffians and looters all of them the cantrev lord who hires their swords to fight his neighbor soon finds them at his own throat dorath protect us from dangers the worst danger is dorath himself hes sure were after treasure taran whispered its in his mind and hell not believe otherwise lucky it is in a way he added ruefully as long as he thinks we can lead him to gold or jewels he wont kill us out of hand perhaps so perhaps not answered fflewddur he may not cut our throats but he might just as well decide to ah shall we say persuade us to tell him where the treasure is and i fear hed do considerably more than tweak our toes im not sure taran replied if he meant to torture us i think hed have tried before this hes put us in a tight corner and we dare not let him travel with us still i dont believe dorath is all that sure of himself were only three against a dozen but dont forget llyan if it comes to a fight dorath has an excellent chance of killing us all yet i think hes shrewd enough to see it would cost him too dearly perhaps most of his band and himself as well i doubt hell risk it unless he has to i hope youre right sighed the bard id rather not stay to find out id sooner spend the night in a nest of serpents we must get free of these villains but how taran frowned and bit his lip eilonwys horn he began yes yes whispered gurgi oh yes magic horn of tootings and hootings help comes with rescuings sound it wise master eilonwys horn taran said slowly yes that was first in my thoughts must i use it now its a precious gift too precious to waste if all else fails he shook his head before i sound it let us try with our own strength sleep now he urged rest as much as you can before first light gurgi can go silently to the horse lines and cut the tethers of all doraths steeds while fflewddur and i try to stun the guards frighten the mounts scatter them in all directions then we ride for dear life put in fflewddur he nodded good its our best chance without blowing that horn of yours i daresay its our only chance dorath he added cradling his harp fondly in his arms my tunes jangle indeed my harp a crooked pot that ruffian has neither ears nor eyes a fflam is forebearing but when he insults my harp dorath goes too far though alas fflewddur admitted ive heard the same opinion from a few others while gurgi and fflewddur drowsed fitfully taran stayed wakeful and uneasy the campfire burned to embers he heard the heavy breathing of doraths men gloff sprawled motionless snoring atrociously for a little time taran closed his eyes had he chosen wrongly by not sounding the battle horn he knew painfully that three lives hung in the balance doli had warned him not to squander the gift but was the gamble too great should the gift be spent now when its need was clearest these thoughts pressed upon him heavier than the moonless night as the black sky began to show the first pale traces of gray taran silently roused gurgi and the bard cautiously they made their way to the tethered steeds tarans heart leaped with hope the two guards were sleeping soundly their swords across their knees he turned meaning to help gurgi cut the lines the dark bole of an oak tree loomed and he clung to the safety of its shadow a booted leg thrust out to bar tarans way dorath was leaning against the tree a dagger in his hand chapter the wager what are you so impatient to be gone lord swineherd said dorath an edge of mockery in his tone the dagger twirled in his hands and he clicked his tongue against his teeth without a farewell without a word of thanks he shook his head this is grave discourtesy to me and to my men their feelings are tender i fear youve deeply wounded them the men of doraths company had begun to stir in a moment of panic taran glanced at fflewddur and gurgi gloff had climbed to his feet and held his sword lightly almost carelessly taran knew the man could bring up the blade in a flash before his own weapon left its sheath tarans eyes darted to the horse lines another of doraths band had drifted close by the steeds where he stood idly paring his nails with the point of a hunting knife taran gestured for the companions to make no move dorath straightened his eyes were cold truly do you mean to part with us even warned of the dangers in the hills he shrugged never say dorath forces hospitality on unwilling guests go if thats in your head seek your treasure and a speedy journey to you we meant you no discourtesy taran answered bear us no ill will for we bear you none farewell to you and your company much relieved he beckoned gurgi and the bard and turned away doraths hand gripped his shoulder how then dorath cried will you go your way without settling the small matter between us taran halted surprised as dorath went on why there is payment to be reckoned lord swineherd will you cheat me of my fee we are poor men lord too poor to give where we do not receive the warriors laughed harshly doraths heavy face had twisted into a leering humility which taran found all the more fearsome by its falsity and the man cried out in an accusing begging tone you have eaten our meat and drunk our wine all night you slept safely under our protection is this worth nothing to you taran stared at him in astonishment and sudden alarm doraths men had come to gather near their leader gurgi edged closer to taran protection fflewddur muttered under his breath wholl protect us from dorath protection great belin id call it robbery and there is more lord swineherd dorath quickly continued the matter of payment for guiding you to the lake of llunet it is no light journey for my company the paths are long and harsh taran faced the man squarely you have given us food drink and shelter he said his thoughts racing to seek escape from doraths trap we will pay their worth as for your protection on our journey we neither ask it nor want it my men are willing waiting and ready to guide you replied dorath it is you who breaks the bargain i struck no bargain with you dorath taran answered doraths eyes narrowed did you not but you will keep it nonetheless the two watched each other in silence for a moment the warriors stirred restlessly from doraths expression taran could not judge whether the man indeed meant to risk battle if he did taran realized coldly the companions had little chance to escape unharmed at last he said what do you want from us dorath grinned now you speak wisely small scores are quickly settled we are humble men lord we ask little far less than what our fee should be but for the sake of the friendship between us dorath will be generous what shall you give me his eyes went to tarans belt you carry a fair blade he said it will be mine tarans hand clenched on the pommel that you shall not have he answered quickly i offer you bridles and harness from our gear and even these we can ill afford dallben my master gave me this blade the first that was truly mine and the first of my manhood the one i love girded it on me with her own hands no dorath i do not bargain with my sword dorath threw back his head and laughed you make much ado for a piece of iron your sweetling girded it to your side your first blade this adds no worth it is a fair weapon no more ive cast away better than that but the look of this one suits me well enough give it into my hand and we are quit doraths face filled with cruel pleasure as he reached out sudden anger goaded taran caution forgotten he snatched the blade from its sheath and drew back a pace have a care dorath taran cried will you take my sword it will be a costly bargain you may not live to claim it nor you to keep it dorath answered undisturbed we know each others thoughts swineherd am i fool enough to risk lives for a trinket are you fool enough to stop me we can learn this easily dorath added to your grief or to mine wilt you try me my company against yours when taran did not answer dorath continued my trade is to spill anothers blood not waste my own and here the matter is easily settled pit one of your number against one of mine a friendly wager swineherd do you dare the stakes your sword gloff had been listening all this while his villainous face lit up and he struck his hands together well spoken dorath well see sport after all the choice is yours swineherd dorath said to taran who is your champion will that hairy brute you call comrade stand against gloff theyre both illfavored enough to be wellmatched or the harper the matter is between you and me dorath taran replied and none other all the better dorath answered do you take the wager then we two unarmed win or lose and the score paid you have doraths word is your word as true as your claim taran flung back i trust no bargain with you dorath shrugged my men will withdraw beyond the trees where theyll be no help to me if thats what you fear and so will yours what say you now yes or no no no shouted gurgi kindly master beware taran looked long at the sword the blade was plain the hilt and pommel unadorned yet even dorath had seen the craftsmanship in its making the day dallben had put it in his hands shone bright in tarans memory as the untarnished metal itself and eilonwy her tart words had not hidden her blush of pride still treasure it though he did he forced himself to see the blade coldly as indeed no more than a strip of metal doubt rose in his heart win or lose he felt unsure whether dorath would let the companions free without a pitched battle he nodded curtly so be it dorath signaled to his band and taran watched cautiously until all had made their way a good distance into the woods at tarans orders fflewddur and gurgi untethered llyan and the two steeds and reluctantly withdrew in the opposite direction taran flung down his cloak and dropped eilonwys horn beside it dorath waited a crafty glint in his eyes as taran slowly ungirded the scabbard and thrust the sword into the ground taran stepped back in the instant dorath sprang upon him without warning the force of the burly warriors charge drove the breath from tarans lungs and nearly felled him dorath grappled with him and taran realized the man strove to seize him by the belt and hurl him to earth taran flung up his arms and slipped downward out of doraths clutches cursing dorath struck at him with a hard fist and though taran escaped the full weight of the blow it glanced painfully from the side of his head ears ringing taran sought to disengage himself and regain sure footing but dorath pressed his attack without respite he dared not taran understood let his heavier opponent come to grips with him for doraths powerful arms could snap him in two as the warrior plunged once more against him taran snatched the mans forearm and with all his strength swung dorath head over heels to send him crashing to the ground but dorath was on his feet in a flash taran crouched to meet the warriors new attack for all his weight dorath moved quick as a cat he dropped to one side spun quickly and suddenly taran saw the mans thick fingers gouging at his eyes as taran struggled to escape the blinding thrust dorath seized him by the hair and wrenched his head backward the warriors fist was raised to strike taran gasping at the painful shock flailed at the mans grinning face doraths hold loosened taran tore himself away for an instant dorath seemed bewildered by the rain of blows and taran pressed his slight advantage darting from one side to the other giving dorath no chance to gain the upper hand again dorath dropped suddenly to one knee and caught at taran with an outflung arm striving to tear himself away taran felt a sharp stinging blow to his side he fell backward clutching at the hurt dorath rose up he gripped a shortbladed knife drawn from his boot disarm taran cried we fight weaponless you betray me dorath the warrior looked down at him have you learned which of us is the fool lord swineherd eilonwys horn lay within tarans grasp and his fingers reached for it how long he thought hurriedly how long before the fair folk might answer his call could he hope to keep dorath at bay or at the last could he do no more than turn and flee he yearned desperately to sound the notes but with an angry shout he cast aside the battle horn snatched up his cloak for a shield and plunged straight against dorath the warriors knife tangled in the folds of the garment gaining strength from his anger taran ripped the blade from the hand of dorath who staggered under the fury of the onslaught and fell to the ground taran followed him seized dorath by the shoulders and braced his knee against the warriors chest cutthroat taran shouted through clenched teeth youd have taken my life for the sake of a bit of iron doraths fingers scrabbled in the earth his arm shot up a handful of dirt and stones pelted against tarans face find me now cried dorath with a mighty heave taran clapped hands to his smarting eyes tears streamed down his face and he groped for the warrior who sprang away in an instant taran stumbled forward on hands and knees doraths heavy boot drove into his ribs taran cried out then fell doubled up and panting he strove to rise but even the strength of his anger could not bring him to his feet he sank down his face pressed against the ground dorath strode to the sword and plucked it from the turf he turned to taran i spare your life swineherd he cried scornfully it means naught to me and i have no wish for it should we meet again it may not go as well for you taran raised his head in doraths eyes he saw only cold hatred that seemed to reach out to blight or shatter all it touched you have won nothing taran whispered what have you gained worth more to you than to me the getting pleased me swineherd the taking pleases me all the more dorath tossed the sword in the air caught it again then threw back his head and burst into raw laughter he turned on his heel and strode into the forest even after his strength had come back and the pain in his side had dwindled to a dull ache taran sat a long while on the ground before gathering up his belongings the torn cloak the battle horn the empty scabbard and setting off to join fflewddur and gurgi dorath had gone there was no sign of him but the laughter still rang in tarans ears chapter the lost lamb under fair skies and gentle weather the companions traveled deeper into the hill cantrevs gurgi had bandaged tarans wound and the smart of it eased more quickly than the sting of losing his sword as for the bard the encounter with dorath had driven away his concern for the length of his ears he hardly mentioned the word rabbit and had begun to share tarans belief in a good ending to a hard journey gurgi still grumbled bitterly about the ruffians and often turned to shake an angry fist in the air fortunately the companions had seen no more of the band though gurgis furious grimaces might well have been enough to keep any marauders at a safe distance shameful robbings muttered gurgi oh kindly master why did you not sound helpful horn and be spared beatings and cheatings the blade meant a great deal to me taran answered but ill find another that will serve me as for eilonwys horn once used its power is gone beyond regaining oh true gurgi cried blinking in amazement as if such a thought had never entered his shaggy head oh wisdom of kindly master will humble gurgis wits never grow sharper weve all wits enough to see taran chose rightly put in fflewddur in his place id have done the same ah no what i meant he quickly added glancing at the harp id have blown that horn till i was blue in the face ho there steady old girl he cried as llyan suddenly plunged ahead i say what are you after now at the same time taran heard a forlorn bleating coming from a patch of brambles llyan was already there crouching playfully her tail waving in the air and one of her paws outstretched to tug at the briars a white lamb was caught in the thicket and seeing the enormous cat bleated all the louder and struggled pitifully while fflewddur strumming his harp drew llyan away taran quickly dismounted with gurgis help he bent aside the brambles and picked up the terrified animal the poor things strayed from where taran said i saw no farm nearby well i suppose it knows its home better than we do answered fflewddur while gurgi eyed the lost animal and delightedly patted the creatures fleecy head all we can do is let it go to find its own path the lamb is mine called a stern voice surprised taran turned to see a tall broadshouldered man making his way with great difficulty down the rocky slope gray streaked his hair and beard scars creased his wide brow and his dark eyes watched the companions intently as he toiled over the jutting stones unarmed save for a long hunting knife in his leather belt he wore the rude garb of a herdsman his cloak was rolled and slung over his back his jacket was tattered at the edges begrimed and threadbare what taran had first taken to be a staff or shepherds crook he now saw to be a roughly fashioned crutch the mans right leg was badly lamed the lamb is mine the herdsman said again why then it is yours to claim taran answered handing the animal to him the lamb ceased its frightened bleating and nestled comfortably against the shoulder of the herdsman whose frown of distrust turned to surprise as if he had fully expected to be obliged to fight for possession of the stray my thanks to you he said after a moment then added i am craddoc son of custennin well met taran said and now farewell your lamb is safe and we have far to go craddoc taking a firm grip on his crutch turned to climb the slope and had gone but little distance when taran saw the man stumble and lose his footing under his burden craddoc faltered and dropped to one knee taran strode quickly to him and held out his hands if the way to your sheepfold is as stubborn as the ones weve traveled taran said let us help you on your path no need the herdsman gruffly cried do you think me so crippled i must borrow strength from others when he saw that taran still offered his hands craddocs expression softened forgive me said the herdsman you spoke in good heart it was i who took your words ill i am unused to company or courtesy in these hills youve done me one service he went on as taran helped him to his feet now do me another share my hospitality he grinned though it will be small payment for saving my lamb as fflewddur led the mounts and gurgi happily bore the lamb in his arms taran walked close by the herdsman who after his first reluctance was willing now to lean on tarans shoulder as the path steepened and twisted upward before dropping into a deep vale among the hills the farmstead taran saw to be a tumbledown cottage whose walls of stone delved from the surrounding fields had partly fallen away halfadozen illshorn sheep grazed over the sparse pasture a rusted plow a brokenhandled mattock and a scant number of other implements lay in an openfronted shed in the midst of the high summits hemmed in closely by thorny brush and scrub the farm stood lorn and desolate yet clung doggedly to its patch of bare ground like a surviving warrior flinging his last lone defiance against a pressing ring of enemies craddoc with a gesture almost of shyness and embarrassment beckoned the companions to enter within the cottage showed scarcely more cheer than the harsh land around it there were signs craddoc had sought to repair his fireplace and broken hearthstone to mend his roof and chink up the crannies in the wall but taran saw the herdsmans labor had gone unfinished in a corner a spinning wheel betokened a womans tasks but if this were so her hand had ceased to guide it long since well friend herdsman fflewddur remarked heartily seating himself on a wooden bench by a narrow trestle table youre a bold man to dwell in these forsaken parts snug it is he quickly added very snug but ah well rather out of the way it is mine craddoc answered and his eyes flashed with pride fflewddurs words seemed to stir him and he bent forward one hand gripping his crutch and the other clenched upon the table i have stood against those who would have taken it from me and if i must so shall i do again why indeed ive no doubt of that replied fflewddur no offense friend but i might say im a little surprised anyone would fancy taking it from you in the first place craddoc did not answer for a time then he said the land was fairer than you see it now here we lived among ourselves untroubled and at peace until certain lords strove to claim our holdings for themselves but those of us who prized our freedom banded together against them hotly fought was the battle and much was destroyed yet we turned them back craddocs face was grim at high cost to us our dead were many and my closest friends among them and i he glanced at his crutch i gained this what of the others taran asked in time one by one they quit their homes craddoc replied the land was no longer worth the keeping or the taking they made their way to other cantrevs in despair they took service as warriors or swallowed their pride and hopes and labored for any who would give them bed and board yet you stayed taran said in a ruined land why so craddoc lifted his head to be free he answered curtly to be my own man freedom was what i sought i had found it here and i had won it you are luckier than i friend herdsman taran answered i have not yet found what i seek when craddoc glanced inquiringly at him taran told of his quest the herdsman listened intently saying no word but as taran spoke a strange expression came upon craddocs face as though the herdsman strove against disbelief and sought to reach out beyond his own wonder when taran finished craddoc seemed about to speak but he hesitated then set the crutch under his arm and rose abruptly murmuring that he must see to his sheep as he hobbled out gurgi trotted after him to gaze with pleasure at the gentle animals the day had grown shadowed taran and fflewddur sat quietly at the table i pity the herdsman as much as i admire him taran said he fought to win one battle only to lose another his own land is his worst foe now and little can he do against it im afraid youre right agreed the bard if the weeds and brambles press him any closer he wryly added he must soon graze his sheep on the turf of his rooftop i would help him if i could taran replied alas he needs more than i can give when the herdsman came back taran made ready to take his leave craddoc however urged the companions to stay taran hesitated though anxious to be gone he well knew that fflewddur disliked traveling at night as for the herdsman his eyes more than his words bespoke his eagerness and at last taran agreed craddocs provisions being scant the companions shared out the food from gurgis wallet the herdsman ate silently when he had done he cast a few dry thorny branches on the small fire watched them flare and crackle then turned his gaze on taran a lamb of my flock strayed and was found again craddoc said but another once was lost and never found the herdsman spoke slowly and with great effort as though the words came from his lips at some painful cost long past when all had left the valley my wife urged that we too should do the same she was to bear our child in this place she saw naught but hardship and desolation and it was for the sake of our unborn that she pleaded craddoc bowed his head but this i would not do as often as she besought me as often i refused in time the child was born our son the infant lived his mother died my heart broke for it was as if i myself had slain her her last wish craddoc said his voice heavy with grief was that i take the child from here his weathered features tightened even that wish i did not heed no he added to my mind i had paid in blood and more than blood for my freedom i would not give it up the herdsman was silent a while then he said alone i sought to raise the child but it was beyond my skill a sturdy boy he was yet in less than a year i saw him sicken only then did i understand his mother had spoken wisely and i like a proud fool had not listened at last i was willing to quit this valley too late was my choice craddoc said i knew the babe could not live out the journey nor could he live out another winter here he was the lamb of my heart already given to death but on a certain day craddoc went on a wayfarer came by chance to my door a man of deep knowledge he was and of many secret healing arts in his hands alone the child could live this he told me and i knew he spoke the truth he pitied the infant and offered to raise him for me grateful was i for his kindness as i put the child in his arms he went his way then and my son with him no more did i see or hear of either as the years passed and often did i fear both had surely perished in the hills yet i still hoped for the stranger vowed by every oath my son one day would return to me the herdsman looked closely at taran the name of the wayfarer was dallben in the fireplace a thorny branch split and crackled craddoc said no more but his eyes never left tarans face fflewddur and gurgi stared wordlessly slowly taran rose to his feet he felt himself trembling for an instant feared his legs would give way under him and he put a hand to the edge of the trestle table he could neither think nor speak he saw only craddoc silently watching him and this man he had met as a stranger now seemed a stranger all the more tarans lips moved without sound until at last the words came brokenly and he heard his voice as though it were anothers do you say taran whispered do you say then you are father to me the promise has been kept craddoc answered quietly my son has come back chapter the end of summer it was near dawn the fire in the hearth had long since burned out taran rose silently he had slept only fitfully his head crowded with so many thoughts he could not sort one from another fflewddurs cry of astonishment gurgis joyful yelps craddocs embrace of welcome to a son he had scarcely seen and tarans bewildered embrace to a father he had never known there had been harp playing and singing fflewddur had never been in better voice or spirits and the herdsmans cottage had surely never rung with so much merriment yet taran and craddoc had been more quiet than gay as if striving to sense each others mind and heart at last all had slept taran stepped to the door the sheep were silent in their fold the mountain air was chill dew glistened a net of cold silver on the sparse pasture and the stones twinkled like stars fallen to earth taran shivered and drew his cloak about him he stood a while in the dooryard before he sensed he was not alone fflewddur moved to join him couldnt sleep eh fflewddur said cheerily neither could i too excited didnt close my eyes for three winks ah yes well perhaps a few more than that great belin but its been a day and a half its not everyone who finds his longlost father sitting out in the middle of nowhere taran my friend your search is ended and ended well were spared a journey to the lake of llunet i dont mind telling you im just as pleased now we must set our plans i say we should ride north to the fair folk realm and get hold of good old doli then on to my kingdom for some feasting and revelry and i suppose youll want to sail to mona and tell eilonwy the good news so be it now your quest is over youre free as a bird free as the caged eagle that morda would have made me taran cried this valley will destroy craddoc if he stays alone even a little longer his burden is too great i honor him for trying to bear it indeed i honor him for that and nothing else his deeds cost my mother her life and nearly cost me mine can any son love such a father yet as long as craddoc lives i am bound to him by ties of blood if truly his blood runs in my veins if replied fflewddur he frowned and looked closely at taran you say if as though you doubted craddoc speaks truth when he says he is my father taran answered it is i who do not believe him hows that again asked fflewddur you know hes your father and doubt it at the same time now you really baffle me fflewddur can you not see taran spoke slowly and painfully i dont believe him because i dont want to believe him in my heart secretly i had always dreamed even as a child that that i might be of noble lineage fflewddur nodded yes i take your meaning he sighed alas theres no choosing ones kinsmen now taran said my dream is no more than a dream and i must give it up his tale rings true answered the bard but if theres doubt in your heart what shall you do ah that rascal kaw if he were only here we could send him with word to dallben but i doubt hell find us in this dreary wasteland wasteland said the voice of craddoc the herdsman stood in the doorway taran quickly turned ashamed of his own words and wondering how many of them craddoc had overheard but if the man had been there longer than a moment he gave no sign of it instead his weatherbeaten face smiled as he hobbled to the companions gurgi followed behind him wasteland you see it now craddoc said but soon as fair as ever it was he set a hand proudly on tarans shoulder my son and i we will make it so i had thought taran began slowly i had hoped you would return with us to caer dallben coll and dallben will welcome you the farm is rich and can be richer still if you help us with your labor here the land may be worn out past restoring how then craddoc answered his features growing stern leave my land to be anothers servant now when there is hope for us at last his eyes filled with pain as he looked at taran my son he said quietly you do not say all that is in your heart nor have i said all that is in mine my happiness blinded me to the truth your life has been too long apart from me caer dallben is your home more than this may ever be this wasteland this fallow ground and the master of it a cripple the herdsman had not raised his voice but the words echoed in tarans ears craddocs face had gone hard as stone and a terrible pride flamed in his eyes i can not ask you to share this nor beg duty from a son who is a stranger to me we have met we shall part if that is your wish go your own path i do not keep you from it before taran could answer craddoc turned and made his way to the sheepfold what must i do taran cried in dismay to the bard fflewddur shook his head hell not leave here thats for certain its easy enough to see where your stubborn streak comes from no he wont budge but if youd set your mind at rest then you yourself might go to caer dallben find out the truth from dallben he alone can tell you winter would be upon us before i could return taran answered he gazed at the harsh land and desolate cottage my my father is at the end of his strength the tasks are long they must begin now and be done before the first snowfall he said no more for a time fflewddur waited silently gurgi was quiet his brow wrinkled with concern taran looked at the two and his heart ached hear me well my friends he said slowly fflewddur if you are willing ride to caer dallben tell that my search is ended and how this has come about as for me my place must be here great belin you mean to stay in this wilderness fflewddur cried even though you doubt taran nodded my doubts may be of my own making one way or another i pray you send word speedily to me but eilonwy must be told nothing of this only that my quest is over my father found his voice faltered craddoc needs my help his livelihood and his life depend on it and i will not withhold it from him but to have eilonwy know i am a herdsmans son no he burst out that would be more than i could bear bid her my farewell she and i must never meet again it were better the princess forget the shepherd boy better that all of you forget me he turned to gurgi and you best of good friends ride with fflewddur if my place is here yours must be in a happier one kindly master gurgi shouted flinging his arms desperately about taran gurgi staysl so he promised call me master no more taran bitterly flung back no master am i but a lowborn churl do you long for wisdom you will not find it here with me take your freedom this valley is no beginning but an ending no no gurgi does not listen shouted gurgi clapping his hands over his ears he threw himself flat on the ground and lay stiff as a poker he does not go from side of kindly master no no not with pullings and pushings not with naggings and draggings so be it taran said at last seeing nothing else would sway the determined creature when craddoc returned taran told him only that he and his companion would stay and that fflewddur could no longer delay his own journey when llyan was ready to travel taran put his arms about the cats mighty shoulders and pressed his cheek into her deep fur as she mewed unhappily silently he and fflewddur clasped hands and he watched while the bard with many a backward glance rode slowly from the valley leaving melynlas and the pony tethered in the shed taran and gurgi bore the saddlebags holding their few possessions into the tumbledown cottage taran stood a moment looking at the crumbling walls of the narrow chamber the dead fire and broken hearthstone from the pasture craddoc was calling to him and so taran murmured and so have we come home in the weeks that followed taran believed he could have fared no worse had morda done as he had threatened tall gray summits rose about him like the unyielding bars of a cage prisoner he sought freedom from his memories in the harsh toil of the long days there was much to be done indeed there was all to be done the land to clear the cottage to repair the sheep to tend at first he had dreaded the dawns that brought him weary as if he had not slept from the straw pallet by the hearth to the seemingly endless labor awaiting him but soon he rediscovered as coll had told him long ago that he could force himself to plunge into it as into an icy stream and find refreshment even in his exhaustion with gurgi and craddoc he strained and sweated to uproot boulders from the field and haul them to the cottage where they would later serve to mend the walls the spring where the sheep watered had dwindled to a slow trickle taran saw a way to unblock it shore up the damp ground and dig a channel which he lined with flat stones as the sparkling stream rushed into its new course taran forgetting all else knelt and drank of it from his cupped hands the cool draught filled him with wonder as though never had he tasted water until now one day the three set about burning away the overgrowth and thorns tarans portion of the field took flame too slowly and he pressed his way to thrust his torch deeper amid the brambles as he did a sudden gust of wind turned the fire against him quickly he drew back but the thorns caught at his jacket he stumbled and fell crying out as the flames rose in a scarlet wave gurgi at some distance heard the shout craddoc seeing tarans plight swung about on his crutch and even before gurgi could reach him flung himself to tarans side the herdsman dropped to the ground and shielding taran with his body seized him by the belt and dragged him clear where taran had been trapped the flaming thorns roared and crackled the herdsman gasping from the effort climbed painfully to his feet though taran was unscathed the fire had seared craddocs brow and hands but the herdsman grinned clapped taran on the shoulder saying with rough affection ive not found a son only to lose him and with no more ado went back to his work my thanks to you taran called but in his voice there was as much bitterness as gratitude for the man who had saved his life was the same man who had broken it thus it was in the days that followed when a sheep sickened craddoc cared for it with an unexpected tenderness that went to tarans heart yet craddoc it was who had torn asunder tarans dream of noble birth and destroyed every hope he had cherished for eilonwy when danger threatened the flock craddoc turned fierce as a wolf heedless of his own safety with a courage taran could only admire yet this man held him prisoner in fetters of blood right craddoc would touch no food until taran and gurgi had their fill and often went hungry as a result all the while insisting his appetite was dull yet the gift stuck in tarans throat and he scorned the generosity he mould have honored in any other man are there two herdsman in this valley taran cried to himself one i can only love and one i can only hate so passed the summer to forget the anguish of his divided heart taran labored for the sake of the labor itself many tasks were still to be done and the flock always to be tended until now craddoc had been hardpressed to keep the new lambs from straying and as the sheep roved farther afield seeking better pasture to gather all into the fold at evening gurgi pleaded to be given charge of them and the flock seemed as pleased as he was he gamboled happily with the lambs clucked and fussed over the ewes and even the ancient badtempered ram turned gentle in his presence as the days grew cooler craddoc gave him a jacket of unshorn fleece and as gurgi moved among his charges taran could hardly distinguish the shaggy creature bundled in his wooly garb from the rest of the flock often taran came upon him sitting on a boulder the sheep in an admiring circle around their guardian they followed him everywhere and would even have trotted after him into the cottage marching at the head of the flock gurgi looked as proud as a war leader see with lookings gurgi shouted see them heed gurgi with bleatings is kindly master assistant pigkeeper then bold clever gurgi now is assistant sheepkeeper but tarans eyes still turned beyond the barrier of the hills at the end of each day he scanned the passes for a sign of fflewddur and the clouds for a glimpse of kaw the crow he feared had flown to the lake of llunet not finding the companions there kaw might still be waiting or impatient be seeking them elsewhere as for the bard taran sensed more than ever that fflewddur would not return and as the days shortened and autumn drew closer he gave up his vigil and looked no longer at the sky chapter the open cage throughout summer and fall the three had worked unstintingly to finish the cottage their only refuge against the oncoming winter now as the first snow whirled from the heavy sky to powder the crags with dry white flakes it was done the walls of new stone rose firm and solid the roof had been thatched anew and tightly chinked against wind and weather within a fire cheerily blazed in the new hearth the wooden benches had been mended the door no longer sagged on broken hinges though craddoc had given himself unsparingly to the toil the cottage for the most part was tarans labor the rusted tools sharpened and refurbished served him to make what other tools he needed the planning as well as the doing had been his and as he stood in the dooryard the fine snow clinging like chaff to his uncropped hair it was not without pride that he watched the smoke rising from the rebuilt chimney craddock had come to stand beside him and the herdsman put a hand fondly on tarans shoulder for a time neither spoke but at last craddoc said for all the years i strove to keep what was mine it is mine no longer his bearded face furrowed in a smile ours he said taran nodded but made no further answer since the winter tasks were short the brief days seemed longer evenings by the fire to while away the time craddoc told of his youth of his settling in the valley as the herdsman spoke of his hopes and hardships tarans admiration quickened and for the first time he saw craddoc as a man who had been not unlike himself thus at craddocs urging taran was willing to tell of his days at caer dallben and all that had befallen him craddocs face brightened with fatherly pride as he heard of these adventures yet often taran would stop in the midst of his recounting when memories of eilonwy and all his life long past would surge suddenly and break upon him like a wave then would he break off abruptly turn his face away and stare at the fire those times craddoc pressed him to speak no further a bond of affection born of their common toil had grown among all three craddoc never failed to treat gurgi with much kindness and gentleness and the creature more than ever pleased with his duties as shepherd was well content but once at the beginning of winter craddoc spoke apart with taran saying since the day you came to dwell here i have called you my son yet never have you called me father taran bit his lips at one time he had yearned to shout aloud his bitterness to fling it angrily in the herdsmans face it still tormented him but now he could not bring himself to wound the feelings of one he scorned as a father yet honored as a man seeing tarans distress craddoc nodded briefly perhaps he said perhaps one day you shall snow turned the gray summits glistening white yet the tall peaks taran once had seen as bars now shielded the valley from the brunt of the storms and against the wolfwind howling through the icebound passes the cottage stood fast late of an afternoon when craddoc and gurgi had gone to see to the flock the gale sharpened and taran set about stretching a heavier sheepskin across the narrow window he had only begun when the door was flung open as though ripped from its hinges shouting frantically gurgi burst into the cottage help oh help kindly master come with hastenings gurgis face was pale as ashes his hands shook violently as he clutched at tarans arm master master follow gurgi quickly oh quickly taran dropped the sheepskin hurriedly donned a fleece jacket and as gurgi moaned and wrung his hands snatched up a cloak and raced through the open door outside the wind caught at him and nearly flung him backward gurgi pressed on wildly waving his arms taran bent forward against the gale and ran beside his desperate companion stumbling across the snowswept field at the edge of the pasture they had cleared during the summer the land fell sharply away into stony slopes and he followed close behind gurgi as the creature scrambled past a rocky draw then along a twisting path where he soon halted taran gasped in dismay as gurgi whimpering fearfully pointed downward a narrow ledge jutted from the sheer side of the gorge a figure arms outflung lay motionless one leg twisted under his body partly covered with fallen stones it was craddoc gone with stumblings gurgi moaned oh miserable gurgi could not save him from slippings he clapped his hands to his head too late too late for helpings tarans head spun with shock grief struck him like a sword but then beyond his will terrifying in its sudden onrush a wild sense of freedom flooded him as though rising from the most hidden depths of his heart in one dizzying glance he seemed to see his cage of stone crumble the still form on the ledge stirred painfully and lifted an arm he lives taran cried oh master how do we save him gurgi wailed terrible crags are steep even bold gurgi fears to climb down is there no way taran exclaimed hes badly hurt dying perhaps we can not leave him he pressed his fists to his reeling forehead even if we could make our way to him how should we bear him up and if we fail not one life lost but three his hands were shaking it was not despair that filled him but terror black terror at the thoughts whispering in his mind was there the slimmest hope of saving the stricken herdsman if not even prince gwydion would not reproach tarans decision nor would any man instead they would grieve with him at his loss free of his burden free of the valley the door of his cage opened wide and all his life awaited him eilonwy caer dallben he seemed to hear his own voice speak these words and he listened in shame and horror then as if his heart would burst with with it he cried out in terrible rage what man am i blind with fury at himself he sprang down the slope and clawed for a handhold amid the icecovered stones while gurgi panting fearfully clambered after him tarans numbed fingers clutched vainly at an outcropping as a rock gave way beneath his feet downward he pitched and cried out as a jagged stone drove against his chest black suns burst in his head and he choked with pain above gurgi was sliding down in a shower of ice and pebbles tarans heart pounded he was on the ledge craddoc lay within arms reach taran crawled to his side blood streamed down craddocs brow as the herdsman struggled to raise his head son son he gasped you have lost your life for me not so taran answered dont try to move well find a way to bring you to safety he raised himself to his knees craddoc was even more grievously hurt than taran had feared carefully he lifted away the heavy stones and shale that pressed against the herdsman and gently drew him closer to the protecting face of the cliff gurgi had dropped to the ledge and scurried to join taran master master he cried gurgi sees a pathway upward but it is steep oh steep with dangers of hurtful stumblings and tumblings taran glanced at where the creature pointed amid the rocks and snowfilled crevices he could make out a narrow passageway free of ice yet as gurgi had warned it rose nearly straight up one man at a time could scale it but what of two burdened with a third he gritted his teeth the sharp stone had wounded him sorely as a blade and each breath he drew filled his lungs with fire he gestured for gurgi to lay hold of craddocs legs while he edged unsteadily along the sheer drop and slid his hands under the herdsmans shoulders as gently as the companions strove to lift him craddoc cried out in agony and they were forced to halt fearful their efforts would do him further harm a wind had risen screaming through the valley lashing at the companions and nearly tearing them from the ledge once more they struggled to bear craddoc to the upward passage and once more fell back as the gale battered them the early twilight had begun deepening and shadows filled the gorge the face of the cliff wavered before tarans eyes his legs trembled as he forced himself again to lift the herdsman leave me craddoc murmured hoarsely leave me you waste your own strength leave you taran burst out what son forsakes his own flesh and blood hearing this craddoc smiled for an instant then his face drew taut in anguish save yourselves he whispered you are my father taran replied i stay no the herdsman cried out with all his strength do as i ask and go from here heed me now or it will be too late the duty of kinship you owe me none no bond of blood holds you how then taran gasped staring wildly at the herdsman his head spun and he clutched at the ledge how then do you tell me i am not your son craddoc looked at him a moment his eyes unwavering never have i been false to any man save once to you a lie taran stammered in dismay did you lie to me then or do you lie to me now halftruth is worse than lie craddoc answered brokenly hear me hear this part of the truth yes long past as he journeyed through prydain dallben sheltered with me but of what he sought he never spoke the child taran cried there was none there was craddoc answered a son our first born even as i told you he did not live beyond the day of his birth his mother died with him he murmured and you i needed your strength to keep what remained to me i saw no other way even as i spoke the lie i was ashamed then more ashamed to speak the truth when your companion left i could only hope that you would follow with him and gave you freedom so to do you chose to stay but this as well is true craddoc said hurriedly at first i leaned upon you as on my crutch because you served my need but no father came to love a son more dearly tarans head sank to his breast he could not speak and his tears blinded him craddoc who had halfraised himself fell back to the stones of the ledge go from here he murmured tarans hand dropped to his side his fingers touched the rim of the battle horn with a sudden cry he straightened eilonwys horn unthinking he had slung it about his shoulder when he had run from the cottage hastily he drew it from beneath his cloak the summons to the fair folk the call he had treasured it alone could save craddoc he stumbled to his feet the ledge seemed to sway beneath him the notes doli had taught him blurred in his mind and he strove desperately to recall them suddenly they rang once more in his memory he raised the horn to his lips the notes sprang loud and clear and even before the signal faded the wind caught them and seemed to fling the call through all the valley where it returned in echo after echo then whirling shadows engulfed him and taran dropped to the ledge how long they clung there he did not know whether moments or hours he was only dimly aware of strong hands bearing him up of a rope lashed about his waist he glimpsed vaguely as between the flickering of a dark flame the broad faces of dwarfish mountaineers whose number he could not judge when next he opened his eyes he was in the cottage the fire blazing gurgi beside him taran started up pain seared his chest which he saw had been carefully bandaged the signal he murmured feebly it was answered yes yes gurgi cried fair folk save us with mighty haulings and heavings they bind up kindly masters hurtful wounds and leave healing herbs for all that is needful the summons taran began good old doli he warned me not to waste it for craddocs sake im glad i kept it as long as i did craddoc where is he how does he fare he stopped suddenly gurgi was looking at him silently the creatures face wrinkled miserably and tears stood in his eyes as he bowed his shaggy head taran fell back his own cry of anguish rang in his ears beyond that was only darkness chapter taran wanderer fever came sweeping over him a blazing forest through which he staggered endlessly tossing on the straw pallet he knew neither day nor night often there were dream faces halfglimpsed halfrecognized of eilonwy of his companions of all whom he had loved yet they slipped away from him shifting and changing like winddriven clouds or were swallowed by nightmares that made him cry out in terror later he seemed to see fflewddur but the bard had turned gaunt holloweyed his yellow hair matted on his forehead his mouth pinched and his long nose thin as a blade his garments hung ragged and stained kaw perched on his shoulder and croaked taran taran yes well indeed its about time youre waking up said fflewddur grinning at him beside the bard gurgi squatted on a wooden stool and peered at him anxiously taran rubbed his eyes unsure whether he was asleep or awake this time the faces did not vanish he blinked the sheepskin had been taken from the window and sunlight streamed over him gurgi kaw taran murmured fflewddur whats happened to you you look like half of yourself youre hardly one to talk about appearances old friend the bard chuckled if you could see yourself im sure youd agree you look worse than i do still baffled taran turned to gurgi who had leaped up joyously and clapped his hands kindly master is well again gurgi shouted he is well without groanings and moanings without shiverings and quiverings and it is faithful clever gurgi who tends him thats true agreed fflewddur for the past two weeks hes fussed over you like a mother hen and he couldnt have given you more care if youd been one of his pet lambs i rode straight as an arrow from caer dallben the bard continued ah well the truth of it is i got lost for a time then it began snowing llyan plowed through drifts up to her ears and even she finally had to stop for a while we sheltered in a cave great belin i thought id never see the light of day again fflewddur gestured at his tattered clothing it was the sort of journey that tends to make one rather unkempt not to mention threefourths starved kaw was the one who happened to find us and he guided us along the clearer trails as for dallben fflewddur went on he was upset considerably more than he wanted to show though all he said was taran is not the herdsmans son but whether or not he stays is a matter entirely of his own choosing and so i came back as fast as i could the bard concluded alas i didnt reach you sooner he shook his head gurgi told me what happened craddoc longed for a son taran answered slowly as i longed for parentage i wonder if i would not have been happier had i believed him though at the end i think i did gurgi and i could have climbed to safety for the sake of craddoc i sounded eilonwys horn had i done it sooner perhaps he might have lived he was a man of courage and good heart a proud man now he is dead i saved the signal to use in a worthy cause and when i found one it was wasted wasted answered fflewddur i think not since you did your best and didnt begrudge using it i shouldnt call it wasted at all there is more that you do not know taran said he looked squarely at the bard my best at first i thought to leave craddoc on the ledge well now replied the bard each man has his moment of fear if we all behaved as we often wished to thered be sorry doings in prydain count the deed not the thought in this i count my thought as much taran said in a cold voice it was not fear that held me back will you know the truth i was ashamed to be baseborn so ashamed it sickened me i would have left craddoc to his death yes left him to die he burst out because i believed it would have set me free of him i was ashamed to be the son of a herdsman but no longer now my shame is for myself he turned his face away and said no more the companions wintered in the cottage and little by little tarans strength came back at the first thaw when the valley sparkled with melting snow and the streams burst from their icebound courses taran stood silently in the dooryard and looked at the pale green summits pondering what had long been in his heart well soon be ready said fflewddur who had come from seeing to llyan and the steeds the passes should be dear the lake of llunet cant be too far and with kaw to help us we should reach it in no time ive thought carefully on this taran replied all winter ive tried to decide what i should do and never have i found an answer but one thing is clear and my mind is made up i will not seek the mirror whats that you saycried fflewddur do i hear you aright give up your search now of all times after all youve gone through taran my boy youve regained your health but not your wits taran shook his head i give it up my quest has brought only grief to all of you and for me its led me not to honor but to shame taran taran makes me sick at heart i longed to be of noble birth longed for it so much i believed it was true a proud birthright was all that counted for me those who had none even when i admired them as i admired aeddan as i learned to admire craddoc i deemed them lesser because of it without knowing them i judged them less than what they were now i see them as true men noble they are far nobler than i i am not proud of myself taran went on i may never be again if i do find pride ill not find it in what i was or what i am but what i may become not in my birth but in myself all things considered then replied the bard the best thing would be to pack our gear and start for caer dallben taran shook his head i can not face dallben or coll one day perhaps not now i must make my own way earn my own keep somehow the robin must scratch for his own worms he stopped suddenly and looked wondering at the bard orddu those were her words i heard them only with my ears until now i did not understand with my heart scratching for worms is unappetizing to say the best of it fflewddur answered but its true everyone should have a skill take myself for example king though i am as a bard youll find none better a harp string snapped and for a moment it appeared that several others might give way yes well aside from all that fflewddur said hastily if you dont mean to go home then i suggest the free commots the craftsmen there might welcome a willing apprentice taran thought for some moments then nodded so shall i do now will i scorn no mans welcome the bards face fell i i fear i cant go with you old friend theres my own realm waiting true enough im happier wandering as a bard than sitting as a king but already ive been too long away then our ways must part again taran replied will there ever be an end to saying farewell but gurgi does not say farewell to kindly master cried gurgi as fflewddur went to gather up his gear no no humble gurgi toils at his side taran bowed his head and turned away if the day comes when i deserve your faithfulness that will be prize enough for me no no protested gurgi not prizings gurgi only gives what is in his heart to give he stays and asks nothing more once you comforted friendless gurgi now let him comfort sorrowful master taran felt the creatures hand on his shoulder dallben spoke truth old friend he murmured staunchness and good sense all that and more but your comfort stands me in better stead than all the cleverness in prydain next morning taran and fflewddur took leave of one another for the second time despite the bards protest that a fflam could always find his way taran insisted on kaws going along as a guide once this task was done taran urged the crow to return to caer dallben or if it pleased him better to fly freely as he chose ill not bind you to my journey taran said to kaw for even i dont know where it may end then how do we fare cried gurgi faithful gurgi follows oh yes but where does kindly master begin the valley seemed suddenly empty as taran stood unanswering looking at the silent cottage and the small mound of stones marking craddocs resting place times there were taran said almost to himself when i believed i was building my own prison with my own hands now i wonder if i shall ever labor as well and gain as much he turned to the waiting gurgi where he knelt plucked a handful of dry grass from the turf and cast it into the air the freshening wind bore the blades eastward toward the free commots there taran said as the wind blows so do we follow it since neither taran nor gurgi wished to leave the sheep behind the wayfarers departed from the valley with the small flock bleating after them taran intended offering the animals to the first farmstead with good grazing land yet several days passed and he saw no inhabited place the two companions had started in a southeasterly direction but taran soon gave melynlas free rein and though aware the stallion was bearing more east than south he paid little heed until they drew near the banks of a wide rapidflowing river here the pasture stretched broad and fair ahead he glimpsed an empty sheepfold he noticed no flock but the gate of the enclosure stood open as though awaiting the animals return at any moment the lowroofed cottage and sheds were neat and wellkept a pair of shaggy goats browsed near the dooryard taran blinked in surprise for set about the cottage were all manner of woven baskets some large some small some rising on stilts and others seemingly dropped at random several trees by the river held wooden platforms and along the riverbank itself taran caught sight of what appeared to be a weir of carefully woven branches wooden stakes secured a number of nets and fishing lines drifting in the current puzzling over this farmhold surely the strangest he had seen taran drew closer dismounted and as he did so a tall figure ambled from the shed and made his way toward the companions taran glimpsed the farm wife peering from the cottage window at the same time as if out of nowhere halfadozen children of different ages burst into sight and began running and skipping toward the flock laughing gaily and shouting to one another theyre here theyre here seeing gurgi they turned their attention from the sheep to cluster around him clapping their hands in delight and calling out such merryhearted greetings that the astonished creature could only laugh and clap his own hands in return the man who stood before taran was thin as a stick with lank hair tumbling over his brow and blue eyes bright as a birds indeed his narrow shoulders and spindly legs made him look like a crane or stork his jacket was too short in the arms too long in the body and his garments seemed pieced together with patches of all sizes shapes and colors i am llonio son of llonwen he said with a friendly grin and a wave of his hand a good greeting to you whoever you may be taran bowed courteously my name my name is taran no more than that said llonio as a name my friend its cropped a little short he laughed goodnaturedly shall i call you taran son of nobody taran of nowhere since youre alive and breathing obviously youre the son of two parents and youve surely ridden here from somewhere else call me then a wanderer taran replied taran wanderer so be it if that suits you llonios glance was curious but he asked no further when taran then spoke of seeking pasture for the sheep llonio nodded briskly why here shall they stay and my thanks to you he exclaimed theres no grazing fresher and sweeter and no sheepfold safer weve seen to that and labored since the first thaw to make it so but i fear they may crowd your own flock taran said though he admired llonios pastureland and the stoutly built enclosure and would have been well content to leave the sheep with him my flock llonio answered laughing i had none until this moment though weve been hoping and waiting and the children have been talking of little else a lucky wind it was that brought you to us goewin my wife needs wool to clothe our young ones now well have fleece and to spare wait wait put in taran altogether baffled do you mean you cleared a pasture and built a sheepfold without having any sheep at all i dont understand that was work in vain was it now asked llonio winking shrewdly if i hadnt would you be offering me a fine flock in the first place and in the second would i have the place to keep them is that not so but you couldnt have known taran began ah ah llonio chuckled why look you i knew that with any kind of luck a flock of sheep was bound to come along one day everything else does now honor us by stopping here a while our fare cant match our thanks but well feast you as best we can before taran could answer llonio bent down to one of the little girls who was staring roundeyed at gurgi now then gwenlliant run see if the brown hens chosen to lay us an egg today he turned to taran the brown hens a moody creature he said but when she has a mind to she puts down a handsome egg he then set the rest of the children running off on different tasks while taran and gurgi watched astonished at the hustle and bustle in this most peculiar household llonio led the two into the cottage where goewin gave them a warm welcome and bade them sit by the hearth in no time gwenlliant was back holding an egg in outstretched hands an egg cried llonio taking it from her raising it aloft and peering as if he had never seen one before an egg it is the finest the brown hens given us look at the size the shape smooth as glass and not a crack on it well feast well on this my friends at first taran saw nothing extraordinary in the egg which llonio praised so highly but caught up by the mans good spirits taran to his own surprise found himself looking at the egg as though he too had never seen one in llonios hands the shell seemed to sparkle so brightly to curve so gracefully and beautifully that even gurgi marveled at it and taran watched almost with regret as goewin cracked such a precious egg into a large earthen bowl nevertheless if llonio intended sharing it among his numerous family taran told himself the fare would indeed be meager yet as goewin stirred the contents of the bowl the children crowded one after the other into the cottage all bearing something that made llonio call out cheerily at each discovery savory herbs he cried thats splendid chop them up well and here whats this a handful of flour better and better well need that pot of milk the goats given us too a bit of cheese just the thing then he clapped his hands delightedly as the last and smallest child held up a fragment of honeycomb what luck the bees have left us honey from their winter store goewin meanwhile was busy popping all these finds into the bowl and before tarans eyes the contents soon filled it nearly to the brim even then his surprise did not end goewin deftly poured the mixture onto a sheet of metal which taran was quite certain was nothing else but a warriors shield hammered flat and held it over the glowing embers within moments the scent of cooking filled the cottage gurgis mouth watered and in no time the farm wife drew a dappled golden cake nearly as big as a cartwheel from the fireplace llonio quickly sliced it into pieces and to tarans amazement there was not only enough for all but some left over he ate his fill of the most delicious egg he ever tasted if egg it could now be called and not even gurgi could eat more now then said llonio when they had finished ill see to my nets come along if you like chapter the weir while gurgi lingered in the cottage taran followed llonio to the riverbank on the way whistling merrily through his teeth llonio stopped to peer into the baskets and taran noticed one of them held a large bee hive undoubtedly the source of the honey which had sweetened goewins cake the rest however stood empty llonio merely shrugged his shoulders no matter he said something will surely fill them later last time a flock of wild geese flew down to rest you should have seen the feathers left after theyd gone enough to stuff cushions for every one of us by now they reached the river which llonio named as small avren since farther south it flowed into great avren itself small it is he said but sooner or later whatever you might wish comes floating along as if to prove his words he began hauling vigorously at the net staked along the bank it came up empty as did the fishing lines undismayed llonio shrugged again tomorrow very likely how then taran exclaimed feeling perplexed as he had ever been do you count on baskets and nets to bring you what you need he looked at the man in astonishment that i do replied llonio laughing goodnaturedly my holding is small i work it as best as i can for the rest why look you if i know one thing its this lifes a matter of luck trust it and a mans bound to find what he seeks one day or the next perhaps so taran admitted but what if it takes longer than that or never comes at all be that as it may answered llonio grinning if i fret over tomorrow ill have little joy today so saying he clambered nimbly onto the weir which taran now saw was made not to bar the flow of water but to strain and sift the current balancing atop this odd construction seeming more cranelike than ever as he bobbed up and down bending to poke and pry among the osiers llonio soon gave a glad cry and waved excitedly taran hurriedly picked his way across the dam to join him his face fell however when he reached llonios side what had caused the mans joyful shout was no more than a discarded horse bridle alas said taran disappointed theres little use in that the bits missing and the reins worn through so be it so be it replied llonio thats what small avrens brought us today and it will serve one way or another he slung the dripping bridle over his shoulder scrambled from the dam and with taran following him set off with long strides through the grove of trees fringing the river in a while llonio whose sharp eyes darted everywhere at once cried out again and stooped at the bottom of a gnarled elm amid the roots and for some distance around mushrooms sprouted abundantly pluck them up wanderer llonio exclaimed theres our supper for tonight the finest mushrooms ive seen tender and tasty were in luck today quickly gathering his finds llonio popped them into a sack dangling from his belt and set off again following llonios rambling halting now and then to cull certain herbs or roots the day sped so swiftly it was nearly over before taran realized it had begun llonios sack being full the two turned their steps back to the cottage taking a path different from the way they had come as they ambled along taran caught his foot on a jutting edge of stone and he tumbled head over heels your luck is better than mine taran laughed ruefully youve found your mushrooms and i no more than a pair of bruised shins not so not so protested llonio hastily scraping away the loam partly covering the stone look you now have you ever seen one so shaped round as a wheel and smooth as an egg a windfall it is that needs only the picking up if a windfall taran thought it was the hardest and heaviest he had stumbled on for llonio now insisted on unearthing the flat rock they did so with much digging and heaving and carrying it between them struggled back to the farmhold where llonio rolled it into the shed already bursting with an odd array of churn handles strips of cloth horse trappings thongs hanks of cord and all the harvest of his weir nets and baskets over the cookfire the mushrooms eked out with the leftover griddle cake and a handful of early vegetables the children had found simmered so deliciously that taran and gurgi needed no urging to stay for the repast as night fell taran welcomed the familys invitation to rest by the hearth gurgi stuffed and contented began snoring instantly and taran for the first time in many days slept soundly and dreamlessly the next morning was bright and crisp taran woke to find the sun high and though he had meant to saddle melynlas and be on his way he did not do so if llonios weir had yielded little the day before the night current had more than made up for it a great sack of wheat had somehow become tangled with a cluster of dead branches which served as a raft and thus had floated downstream undampened by the river goewin without delay brought out a large stone quern to grind the grain into meal all took a hand in the task the children from eldest to youngest even llonio himself taran did his share willingly though he found the quern heavy and cumbersome as did gurgi oh tiresome millings gurgi cried gurgis poor fingers are filled with achings and his arms with strainings and painings nevertheless he finished his turn although by the time enough meal had been ground another day had nearly sped by and once more llonio urged the wayfarers to share his hospitality taran did not refuse indeed as he stretched by the fire he admitted to himself he had secretly hoped llonio would suggest it during the next few days tarans heart was easier than it had been since he chose to abandon his quest the children shy with him at first as he with them had become his fast friends and frolicked with him as much as they did with gurgi with llonio each day he visited the nets the baskets and the weir sometimes returning emptyhanded and sometimes laden with whatever strange assortment the wind or current brought in the beginning he had seen no value in these odds and ends but llonio found a use for nearly all a cartwheel was turned into a spinning wheel parts of the horsebridle made belts for the children a saddlebag became a pair of boots and taran shortly realized there was little the family needed that did not late or soon appear from nowhere and there was nothing an egg a mushroom a handful of feathers delicate as ferns that was not held to be a treasure in a way taran told gurgi llonios richer than lord gast is or ever will be not only that hes the luckiest man in prydain i envy no mans riches taran added then he sighed and shook his head but i wish i had llonios luck when he repeated this to llonio the man only grinned and winked at him luck wanderer one day if youre lucky ill tell you the secret of it beyond that llonio would say no more at this time a thought had begun taking shape in tarans mind nearly all of llonios finds had been put to one use or another save the flat stone which still lay in the shed but i wonder he told llonio i wonder if it couldnt serve to grind meal better than the quern how then cried llonio greatly pleased if you think it can do as you see fit still pondering his idea taran roamed the woods until he came upon another stone of much the same size as the first thats a stroke of luckhe laughed as llonio helped him drag it back llonio grinned so it is so it is during the several days following taran with gurgis eager help toiled unceasingly in a corner of the shed he set one stone firmly in the ground and the other above it in this he laboriously hollowed out a hole and using the leftover harness leathers in it he affixed a long pole that reached up through an opening in the roof at the top of the pole he attached frames of wood over which he stretched large squares of cloth but this is no quern gurgi cried when at last it was done it is a ship for boatings and floatings but there is no ship only mast with sails we shall see taran answered calling llonio to judge his handiwork for a moment the family stood puzzled at tarans peculiar structure then as the wind stirred the roughly fashioned sails caught the current of the breeze the mastlike pole shuddered and creaked and for a breathless instant taran feared all his work would come tumbling about his ears but it held fast the sails bellied out and began turning slowly at first then faster and faster while below in the shed the upper stone whirled merrily goewin hastened to throw grain into tarans makeshift mill in no time out poured meal finer than any the quern had ground the children clapped their hands and shouted gleefully gurgi yelped in astonishment and llonio laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks wanderer he cried youve made much from little and done it better than ever i could over the next few days the mill not only ground the familys grain taran also struck on a means of using it as a sharpening stone for llonios tools looking at his handiwork taran felt a stirring of pride for the first time since leaving craddocs valley but with it came a vague restiveness by rights he told gurgi i should be more than happy to dwell here all my life ive found peace and friendship and a kind of hope as well its eased my heart like balm on a wound he hesitated yet somehow llonios way is not mine a spur drives me to seek more than what small avren brings what i seek i do not know but alas i know it is not here he spoke then with llonio and regretfully told him he must take up his journeying again this time sensing tarans decision firmly made llonio did not urge him to stay and they bade each other farewell and yet taran said as he swung astride melynlas alas you never told me the secret of your luck secret replied llonio have you not already guessed why my lucks no greater than yours or any mans you need only sharpen your eyes to see your luck when it comes and sharpen your wits to use what falls into your hands taran gave melynlas rein and with gurgi at his side rode slowly from the banks of small avren as he turned to wave a last farewell he heard llonio calling after him trust your luck taran wanderer but dont forget to put out your nets chapter the free commots from small avren they wended eastward at an easy pace halting as it pleased them sleeping on the turf or sheltering at one of the many farmsteads among the rich green vales this was the land of the free commots of cottages clustering in loose circles rimmed by cultivated fields and pastures taran found the commot folk courteous and hospitable though he named himself only as taran wanderer the dwellers in these hamlets and villages respected his privacy and asked nothing of his birthplace rank or destination taran and gurgi had ridden into the outskirts of commot cenarth when taran reined up melynlas at a long lowroofed shed from which rang the sound of hammer on anvil within he found the smith a barrelchested leatheraproned man with a stubbly black beard and a great shock of black hair bristly as a brush his eyelashes were scorched grime and soot smudged his face sparks rained on his bare shoulders but he seemed to count them no more than fireflies in a voice like stones rattling on a bronze shield he roared out a song in time with his hammer strokes so loudly that taran judged the mans lungs as leathery as his bellows while gurgi cautiously drew back from the shower of sparks taran called a greeting scarcely able to make himself heard above the din master smith he said bowing deeply as the man at last caught sight of him and put down the hammer i am called taran wanderer and journey seeking a craft to help me earn my bread i know a little of your art and ask you to teach me more i have no gold or silver to pay you but name any task and i will do it gladly away with you shouted the smith tasks i have aplenty but no time for teaching others to do them is time what lacks taran said glancing shrewdly at the smith ive heard it said that a man must be a true master of his craft if he would teach it hold roared the smith as taran was about to turn away and he snatched up the hammer as if he meant to throw it at tarans head you doubt my skill ive flattened men on my anvil for less skill in all the free comrnots none has greater than hevydd son of hirwas with that he seized the tongs drew a bar of redhot iron from the roaring furnace flung it on the anvil and set to hammering with such quick strokes that taran could hardly follow the movement of hevydds muscular arm and suddenly there formed at the end of the bar a hawthorn blossom perfect in every turn of leaf and petal taran looked at it in astonishment and admiration never have i seen work so deftly done nor will you see it elsewhere hevydd answered at pains to hide a proud grin but what tale do you tell me you know the shaping of metal the secrets are not given to many even i have not gained them all angrily he shook his bristly head the deepest they lie hidden in annuvin stolen by arawn deathlord lost they are lost forever to prydain but here take these ordered the smith pressing the tongs and hammer into tarans hands beat the bar smooth as it was and quickly before it cools show me what strength you have in those chicken wings of yours taran strode to the anvil and as coll had taught him long ago did his best to straighten the rapidly cooling iron the smith folding his huge arms eyed him critically for a time then burst into loud laughter enough enough cried hevydd you speak truth of the art indeed you know little and yet he added rubbing his chin with a battered thumb nearly as thick as a fist and yet you have the sense of it he looked closely at taran but have you courage to stand up to fire to fight hot iron with only hammer and tongs teach me the craft taran replied youll have no need to teach me courage boldly said cried hevydd clapping taran on the shoulder ill temper you well in my forge prove yourself to me and ill vow to make a smith of you now to begin his eye fell on tarans empty scabbard once it would seem you bore a blade once i did taran answered but it is long gone and now i journey weaponless then you shall make a sword commanded hevydd and when youve done youll tell me which is harder labor smiting or smithing to this taran learned the answer soon enough the next several days were the most toilsome he had ever spent he thought at first the smith would set him to work shaping one of the many bars already in the forge but hevydd had no such intention what start when half the work is done hevydd snorted no no my lad youll forge a sword from beginning to end thus the first task hevydd gave taran was gathering fuel for the furnace and from dawn to dusk taran stoked the fire until he saw the forge as a roaring flametongued monster that could never eat its fill even then the work had only begun for hevydd soon put him to shoveling in a very mountain of stones then smelting out the metal they bore by the time the bar itself was cast tarans face and arms were scorched and blackened and his hands were covered with more blisters than skin his back ached his ears rang with all the clank and clatter and with hevydds voice shouting orders and instructions gurgi who had offered to pump the bellows never faltered even when a cloud of sparks burst and flew into his shaggy hair singeing it away in patches until he looked as if a flock of birds had plucked him to make their nests lifes a forge cried the smith as taran his brow streaming beat at the strip of metal yes and hammer and anvil too youll be roasted smelted and pounded and youll scarce know whats happening to you but stand boldly to it metals worthless till its shaped and tempered despite the weariness that made him drop gratefully at days end to the straw pallet in the shed tarans heart quickened and his spirits rose as the blade little by little took shape on the anvil the heavy hammer seemed to weigh more each time he lifted it but at last with a joyous cry he flung it down and raised the finished sword wellwrought and balanced gleaming brightly in the light of the forge a handsome weapon master smith he cried as fair as the one i bore what then hevydd exclaimed have you done your work so well would you trust your life to a blade untried he flung out a burly arm toward a wooden block in a corner of the forge strike hard he commanded the flat the edge and the point proudly taran raised the sword high and swung it down to the block the weapon shuddered with the force of the blow a sharp crack and clang smote his ears as the blade shattered and the shards went flying in all directions taran shouted in dismay and could have wept as he stared disbelieving at the broken hilt still clutched in his hand he turned and gave hevydd a despairing glance so ho cried the smith not at all distressed by tarans wretched and rueful expression did you think to gain a worthy blade at first go he laughed loudly and shook his head then what must i do taran cried appalled at hevydds words do the smith retorted what else but start anew and so they did but this time for taran there remained little of his joyous hopes he labored grimly and doggedly all the more dejected when hevydd ordered him to cast aside two new blades even before they were tempered judging them already flawed the reek of hot metal clung in his nostrils and flavored even the food he hastily swallowed the billows of steam from the great quenching tub choked him as if he were breathing clouds of scalding fog the ceaseless din almost addled his wits until indeed he felt it was himself not the blade being hammered the next blade he shaped seemed to him ugly dinted and scarred without the fair proportions of the first and this too he would have cast aside had not the smith ordered him to finish it this may well serve hevydd told him confidently despite the doubtful look taran gave him again taran strode to the block and raised the sword doing his best to shatter the ungraceful weapon he brought it down with all his strength the blade rang like a bell this time it was the block that split in two now said hevydd quietly thats a blade worth bearing then he clapped his hands and seized tarans arm youve strength in those chicken wings after all youve proved yourself as well as you proved the blade stay lad and ill teach you all i know taran said nothing for a time but looked not without pride at the newforged blade you have already taught me much he said at last to hevydd though i lost what i had hoped to gain for i had hoped i was indeed a swordsmith i have learned that i am not how then cried hevydd youve the makings of an honest swordsmith as good as any in prydain it cheers me to think that may be true taran answered but i know in my heart your craft is not mine a spur drove me from small avren and it drives me now and so must i journey even if i wished to stay the smith nodded you are wellnamed wanderer so be it i ask no man to go against his heart keep the blade in token of friendship yours it is more so than any other for you forged it with your own hands its not a noble weapon and thus it suits me all the more taran laughed glancing at the ungainly sword lucky it was that i didnt have to make a dozen before it luck snorted hevydd as taran and gurgi took leave of him not so more labor than luck lifes a forge say i face the pounding dont fear the proving and youll stand well against any hammer and anvil with hevydd the smith waving a sooty hand in farewell the companions traveled on bearing northward along the rich valley of great avren a few days of easy riding through pleasant countryside brought them to the edge of commot gwenith here a shower suddenly began pelting down on them and the wayfarers galloped for the first shelter they could find it was a cluster of sheds stables chicken roosts and storehouses seeming to ramble in all directions but as taran dismounted and hastened to the cottage amid the maze of buildings he realized all were linked by covered walkways or flagstoned paths and whichever he followed would sooner or later have brought him to the doorway that opened almost before he knocked on it come in and a good greeting to you called a voice crackling like twigs in a fire as gurgi scuttled inside to escape the teeming rain taran saw a bent old woman cloaked in gray beckoning him to the hearth her long hair was white as the wool on the distaff hanging from her belt of plaited cords below her shortgirt robe her bony shins looked thin and hard as spindles a web of wrinkles covered her face her cheeks were withered but for all her years she gave no sign of frailty as though time had only toughened and seasoned her and her gray eyes were sharp and bright as a pair of new needles i am dwyvach weaverwoman she replied as taran bowed courteously and told her his name taran wanderer she repeated with a tart smile from the look of you id say youve indeed been wandering more than youve been washing and thats clear as the warp and weft on my loom yes yes cried gurgi see loom of weavings see windings and bindings so many it makes gurgis poor tender head swim with twirlings and whirlings taran for the first time noticed a high loom standing like a giant harp of a thousand strings in a corner of the cottage around it were stacked bobbins of thread of all colors from the rafters dangled skeins of yarn hanks of wool and flax on the walls hung lengths of finished fabrics some of bright hue and simple design others of subtler craftsmanship and patterns more difficult to follow taran gazed astonished at the endless variety then turned to the weaverwoman of gwenith this calls for skill beyond anything i know he said admiringly how is such work done how done the weaverwoman chuckled it would take me more breath to tell than you have ears to listen but if you look you shall see so saying she hobbled to the loom climbed to the bench in front of it and with surprising vigor began plying the shuttle back and forth all the while working her feet on the treadles below hardly pausing to glance at her handiwork at last she stopped cocked her head at taran fixed him with her sharp gray eyes and said thus is it done wanderer as all things are each in its own way thread by thread tarans amazement had grown all the more this would i gladly learn he said eagerly the craft of the swordsmith was not mine perhaps the craft of the weaver may be i pray you will you teach it to me that i will since you ask replied dwyvach but mind you it is one thing to admire a wellwoven bit of cloth and another to sit yourself before the loom my thanks to you taran exclaimed ill not fear to labor at your loom with hevydd the smith i didnt shrink from hot iron or the flames of his forge and a weavers shuttle is a lighter burden than a smiths hammer think you so dwyvach asked with a dry chuckle that sounded like knitting needles clicking together then what shall you weave to begin with she went on eyeing him sharply taran wanderer you call yourself taran threadbare would be more like it would you weave yourself a new cloak thus youll gain something to put on your back and ill see what skill you have in your fingers taran willingly agreed but next day instead of teaching him weaving dwyvach led the companions to one of her many chambers which taran saw full nearly to bursting with piles of wool tease out the thorns pick out the cockleburs the weaverwoman ordered comb it card it carefully wanderer or when your cloak is done youll feel its made of thistles instead of wool the size of the task ahead of him made taran despair of ever finishing but he and gurgi started the painstaking work with dwyvach herself lending a hand the aged weaverwoman taran soon learned had not only a tart tongue but a keen eye nothing escaped her she spied the smallest knot speck or flaw and brought tarans attention to it with a sharp rap from her distaff to his knuckles but what smarted taran more than the distaff was to learn that dwyvach despite her years could work faster longer and harder than he himself at the end of each day tarans eyes were bleary his fingers raw and his head nodded wearily yet the old weaverwoman was bright and spry as if the day had scarce begun nevertheless the work at last was finished but now dwyvach set him in front of a huge spinning wheel the finest wool is useless until its spun to thread the weaver woman told him so youd best begin learning that as well but spinnings are womans toilings gurgi protested no no spinnings are not fitting for bold and clever weavermen indeed snorted dwyvach then sit you down and learn otherwise ive heard men complain of doing womans work and women complain of doing mans work she added fastening her bony thumb and forefinger on gurgis ear and marching him to a stool beside taran but ive never heard the work complain of who did it so long as it got done and so under dwyvachs watchful eye taran and gurgi spun thread and filled bobbins during the next few days chastened by dwyvachs words gurgi did his best to help though all too often the hapless creature managed only to tangle himself in the long strands next dwyvach took the companions to a shed where pots of dye bubbled over a fire here taran fared no better than gurgi for when the yarn was at last dyed he was bespattered from head to toe with colors and gurgi himself looked like a rainbow suddenly sprouting hair not until all these other tasks were done to dwyvachs satisfaction did she take taran to a weaving room and there his heart sank for the loom stood bare and stark as a leafless tree how then clucked the weaverwoman as taran gave her a rueful glance the loom must be threaded did i not tell you all things are done step by step and strand by strand hevydd the smith told me life was a forge taran sighed as he laboriously tried to reckon the countless threads needed and i think ill be welltempered before my cloak is finished life a forge said the weaverwoman a loom rather where lives and days intertwine and wise he is who can learn to see the pattern but if you mean to have a new cloak youd do better to work more and chatter less or did you hope for a host of spiders to come and labor for you even after deciding on the pattern and threading the loom taran still saw only a hopeless confusing tangle of threads the cloth was painfully slow in forming and at the end of a long day he had little more than a hands breadth of fabric to show for all his toil did i ever think a weavers shuttle a light burden taran sighed it feels heavier than hammer tongs and anvil all together its not the shuttle that burdens you answered dwyvach but lack of skill a heavy burden wanderer that only one thing can lift what secret is that taran cried teach it to me now or my cloak will never be done but dwyvach only smiled it is patience wanderer as for teaching it that i can not do it is both the first thing and the last thing you must learn for yourself taran gloomily went back to work sure he would be as ancient as dwyvach before finishing the garment nevertheless as his hands became used to the task the shuttle darted back and forth like a fish among reeds and the cloth grew steadily on the loom though dwyvach was satisfied with his progress taran to his own surprise was not the pattern he murmured frowning it i dont know somehow it doesnt please me now then wanderer replied dwyvach no man put a sword to your throat the choice of pattern was your own that it was taran admitted but now i see it closely i would rather have chosen another ah ah said dwyvach with her dry chuckle in that case you have but one of two things to do either finish a cloak youll be illcontent to wear or unravel it and start anew for the loom weaves only the pattern set upon it taran stared a long while at his handiwork at last he took a deep breath sighed and shook his head so be it ill start anew over the next few days he ruefully unthreaded and rethreaded the loom but after it was ready and he began weaving once again he was delighted to find the cloth grow faster than ever it had done before and his spirits rose with his newfound skill when the cloak at last was done he held it up proudly this is far better than what i had he cried but i doubt ill ever be able to wear a cloak again without thinking of every thread gurgi shouted triumphantly and dwyvach bobbed her head in approval wellwoven she said her expression had lost much of its tartness and she looked fondly at taran seeming to smile within herself you have skill in your fingers wanderer she said with unaccustomed gentleness enough to make you one of the finest weavers in prydain and if my distaff and your knuckles met more often than you liked it was because i deemed you worth reproving dwell in my house if you choose work at my loom and what i know i will teach you taran did not answer immediately and as he hesitated the weaverwoman smiled and spoke again i know what is in your heart wanderer she said a young mans way is restless yes and a young girls too im not so gone in years that ive forgotten your face tells me it is not your wish to stay in commot gwenith taran nodded as much as i hoped to be a swordsmith so i hoped to be a weaver but you speak truth this is not the way i would follow then must we say farewell answered the weaver woman but mind you she added in her usual sharp tone if life is a loom the pattern you weave is not so easily unraveled taran and gurgi set off again still journeying northward and soon commot gwenith was far behind them though taran wore his new cloak on his shoulders and his new blade at his side his pleasure in them shortly gave way to disquiet the words of dwyvach lingered in his mind and his thoughts turned to another loom in the distant marshes of morva and what of orddu he said does she weave with more than threads the robin has truly been scratching for his worms but have i indeed chosen my own pattern or am i no more than a thread on her loom if that be so then i fear its a thread serving little purpose at any rate he added with a rueful laugh its a long and tangled one but these gloomy thoughts flew from his mind when some days later melynlas bore him to the top of a rise and he looked down on the fairest commot he had ever seen a tall stand of firs and hemlocks circled broad welltended fields green and abundant white thatchroofed cottages sparkled in shafts of sunlight the air itself seemed different to him cool and touched with the sharp scent of evergreens his heart quickened as he watched and a strange excitement filled him gurgi had ridden up beside him kindly master can we not stop here yes taran murmured his eyes never leaving the fields and cottages yes here shall we rest he urged melynlas down the slope with gurgi cantering eagerly behind him crossing a shallow stream taran reined up at the sight of a hale old man digging busily near the waters edge beside him stood a pair of wooden buckets on a yoke and into these he carefully poured spadefuls of pale brown earth his irongray hair and beard were cropped short despite his age his arms seemed as brawny as those of hevydd the smith a good greeting to you master delver taran called what place is this the man turned wiped his deeply lined brow with a forearm and looked at taran with keen blue eyes the water your horse is standing in and churning to mud by the way is fernbrake stream the commot this is commot merin chapter the potters wheel ive told you where you are the man went on goodnaturedly as taran dismounted at the bank of the stream now might you be willing to tell me who you are and what brings you to a place whose name you must ask have you lost your way and found merin when you sought another commot i am called wanderer taran replied as for losing my way he added with a laugh i cant say that i have for im not sure myself where my path lies then merin is as fair a place as any to break your journey the man said come along if youd see what hospitality i can offer the two of you as the man dropped a last spadeful of clay into the wooden buckets taran stepped forward and offered to carry them and since the man did not refuse set his shoulders under the yoke but the buckets were heavier than taran reckoned his brow soon burst out in sweat he could barely stagger along under the load he felt doubling at every pace and the hut to which the man pointed seemed to grow farther instead of closer if you seek daub to mend your chimney taran gasped youve come a long way to find it youve not caught the trick of that yoke said the man grinning broadly at tarans effort he shouldered the buckets which taran gladly gave back and strode along so briskly despite the weight of his burden that he nearly outdistanced the companions arriving at a long shed he poured the clay into a great wooden vat then beckoned the wayfarers to enter his hut inside taran saw racks and shelves holding earthenware of all kinds vessels of plain baked clay graceful jars and among these at random pieces whose craftsmanship and beauty made him catch his breath only once in the treasure house of lord gast had he set eyes on handiwork such as this he turned astonished to the old man who had begun laying dishes and bowls on an oaken table when i asked if you sought daub to mend your chimney i spoke foolishly taran said humbly bowing if this is your work i have seen some of it before and i know you annlaw clayshaper the potter nodded my work it is if youve seen it it may be that indeed you do know me for i am old at my craft wanderer and no longer sure where the clay ends and annlaw begins or in truth if theyre not one and the same taran looked closer at the vessels crowding the hut at the newly finished wine bowl shaped even more skillfully than the one in lord gasts trove at the long clayspattered tables covered with jars of paints pigments and glazes now he saw in wonder that what he had first taken for common sculleryware was as beautiful in its own way as the wine bowl all had come from a masters hand he turned to annlaw it was told me taran said that one piece of your making is worth more than all of a cantrev lords treasure house and i well believe it and here he shook his head in amazement this is a treasure house in itself yes yes gurgi cried oh skillful potter gains riches and fortunes from clever shapings riches and fortune replied annlaw smiling food for my table rather most of these pots and bowls i send to the small commots where the folk have no potter of their own as i give what they need they give what i need and treasure is what i need the least my joy is in the craft not the gain would all the fortunes in prydain help my fingers shape a better bowl there are those taran said half in earnest as he glanced at the potters wheel who claim work such as yours comes by enchantment at this annlaw threw back his head and laughed heartily i wish it did for it would spare much toil no no wanderer my wheel alas is like any other true it is he added that govannion the lame master craftsman of prydain long ago fashioned all manner of enchanted implements he gave them to whom he deemed would use them wisely and well but one by one they fell into the clutches of arawn deathlord now all are gone but govannion too discovered and set down the high secrets of all crafts annlaw went on these as well arawn stole to hoard in annuvin where none may ever profit from them the potters face turned grave a lifetime have i striven to discover them again to guess what might have been their nature much have i learned learned by doing as a child learns to walk but my steps falter the deepest lore yet lies beyond my grasp i fear it ever shall let me gain this lore annlaw said and ill yearn for no magical tools let me find the knowledge and these he added holding up his claycrusted hands these will be enough to serve me but you know what you seek taran answered i alas seek without knowing even where to look he then told annlaw of hevydd the smith and dwyvach the weaverwoman of the sword and cloak he had made i was proud of my work taran went on yet at the end neither anvil nor loom satisfied me what of the potters wheel asked annlaw when taran admitted he knew nothing of this craft and prayed annlaw to let him see the shaping of clay the old potter willingly agreed annlaw drew up his coarse robe and seated himself at the wheel which he quickly set spinning and on it flung a lump of clay the potter bent almost humbly to his work and reached out his hands as tenderly as if he were lifting an unfledged bird before tarans eyes annlaw began shaping a tall slender vessel as taran stared in awe the clay seemed to shimmer on the swiftly turning wheel and to change from moment to moment now taran understood annlaws words for indeed between the potters deft fingers and the clay he saw no separation as though annlacvs hands flowed into the clay and gave it life annlaw was silent and intent his lined face had brightened the years had fallen away from it taran felt his heart fill with a joy that seemed to reach from the potter to himself and in that moment understood that he was in the presence of a true master craftsman greater than any he had ever known fflewddur was wrong taran murmured if there is enchantment it lies not in the potters wheel but in the potter enchantment there is none answered annlaw never turning from his work a gift perhaps but a gift that bears with it much toil if i could make a thing of such beauty it is toil i would welcome taran said sit you down then said annlaw making room for taran at the wheel shape the clay for yourself when taran protested he would spoil annlaws halfformed vessel the potter only laughed spoil it you will surely ill toss it back into the kneading trough mix it with the other clay and sooner or later it will serve again it will not be lost indeed nothing ever is but comes back in one shape or another but for yourself taran said the skill you have already put in it will be wasted the potter shook his head not so craftsmanship isnt like water in an earthen pot to be taken out by the dipperful until its empty no the more drawn out the more remains the heart renews itself wanderer and skill grows all the better for it here then your hands thus your thumbs thus from the first moment taran felt the clay whirling beneath his fingers his heart leaped with the same joy he had seen on the potters face the pride of forging his own sword and weaving his own cloak dwindled before this new discovery that made him cry out in sudden delight but his hands faltered and the clay went awry annlaw stopped the wheel tarans first vessel was so lopsided and misshapen that despite his disappointment he threw back his head and laughed annlaw clapped him on the shoulder welltried wanderer the first bowl i turned was as illfavored and worse you have the touch for it but before you learn the craft you must first learn the clay dig sift and knead it know its nature better than that of your closest companion then grind pigments for your glazes understand how the fire of the kiln works upon them annlaw clayshaper taran said in a low voice that hid nothing of his yearning will you teach me your craft this more than all else i long to do annlaw hesitated several moments and looked deeply at taran i can teach you only what you can learn said the potter how much that may be time will tell stay if that is your wish tomorrow we shall begin the two wayfarers made themselves comfortable that night in a snug corner of the pottery shed gurgi curled on the straw pallet but taran sat with knees drawn up and arms clasped about them its strange he murmured the more of the commot folk ive known the fonder have i grown of them yet commot merin drew me at first sight closer than all the others the night was soft and still taran smiled wistfully in the darkness the moment i saw it i thought it the one place id be content to dwell and that that even eilonwy might have been happy here and at annlaws wheel he went on when my hands touched the clay i knew i would count myself happy to be a potter more than smithing more than weaving its as though i could speak through my fingers as though i could give shape to what was in my heart i understand what annlaw meant there is no difference between him and his work indeed annlaw puts himself into the clay and makes it live with his own life if i too might learn to do this gurgi did not answer the weary creature was fast asleep taran smiled and drew the cloak over gurgis shoulders sleep well he said we may have come to the end of our journey annlaw was as good as his word in the days that followed the potter showed taran skills no less important than the working of the clay itself the finding of proper earths judging their texture and quality sifting mixing tempering gurgi joined taran in all the tasks and soon his shaggy hair grew so crusted with dust mud and gritty glaze that he looked like an unbaked clay pot set on a pair of skinny legs the summer sped quickly and happily and the more taran saw the potter at his craft the more he marveled at the kneading trough annlaw pounded the clay with greater vigor than hevydd the smith at his anvil and at the wheel did the most intricate work with a deftness surpassing even that of dwyvach the weaverwoman as early as he rose in the mornings taran always found the potter already up and about his tasks annlaw was tireless often spending nights without sleep and days without food absorbed in labor at his wheel seldom was the potter content to repeat a pattern but strove to better even what he himself had originated stale water is a poor drink said annlaw stale skill is worse and the man who walks in his own footsteps only ends where he began not until autumn did annlaw let taran try his hand at the wheel again this time the bowl taran shaped was not as illformed as the other annlaw studying it carefully nodded his head and told him you have learned a little wanderer nevertheless to tarans dismay annlaw cast the bowl into the kneading trough never fear said the potter when you shape one worth the keeping it will be fired in the kiln though taran feared such a time might never come it was not long before annlaw judged a vessel a shallow bowl simple in design yet wellproportioned to be ready for firing he set it along with other pots and bowls he had crafted for the folk of commot isav into a kiln taller and deeper than hevydds furnace while annlaw calmly turned to finishing other vessels for the commot folk tarans anxiety grew until he felt that he himself was baking in the flames but at last when the firing was done and the pieces had cooled the potter drew out the bowl turned it around in his hands as taran waited breathlessly and tapped it with a clayrimmed finger he grinned at taran it rings true beginners work wanderer but not to be ashamed of tarans heart lifted as if he had fashioned a wine bowl handsomer than ever lord gast has seen but his joy changed soon to despair through autumn taran shaped other vessels yet to his growing dismay none satisfied him none matched his hopes despite the painful toil he poured into the work what lacks he cried to annlaw i could forge a sword well enough and weave a cloak well enough but now what i truly long to grasp is beyond my reach must the one skill i sought above all be denied me he burst out in an anguished voice is the gift forbidden me he bowed his head and his heart froze even as he spoke the words for he knew within himself he had touched the truth annlaw did not gainsay him but only looked at him for a long while with deep sadness why taran whispered why is this so it is a heavy question annlaw replied at last he put a hand on tarans shoulder indeed no man can answer it there are those who have labored all their lives to gain the gift striving until the end only to find themselves mistaken and those who had it born in them yet never knew those who lost heart too soon and those who should never have begun at all count yourself lucky the potter went on that you have understood this now and not spent your years in vain hope this much have you learned and no learning is wasted what then shall i do taran asked grief and bitterness such as he had known in craddocs valley flooded over him there are more ways to happiness than in the shaping of a pot replied annlaw you have been happy in merin you still can be there is work for you to do your help is welcome and valuable to me as a friend as much as an apprentice why look you now he went on in a cheerful tone tomorrow i would send my ware to commot isav but a days journey is long for one of my years as a friend will you bear the burden for me taran nodded i will carry your ware to isav he turned away knowing that his happiness was ended like a flawed vessel shattered in the firing chapter the spoilers next morning as taran had promised he loaded melynlas and gurgis pony with the potters ware and gurgi beside him set out for commot isav annlaw he knew could as well have sent word to the commot folk asking them to come and bear away their own vessels this is not an errand i do for him but a kindness he does for me taran told gurgi i think he means to give me time to myself to find my own thoughts as for that he added sorrowfully so far ive found none i long to stay in merin yet theres little to keep me here i prize annlaw as my friend and as a master of his craft but his craft will never be mine still pondering and troubled at heart taran reached isav some while before dusk it was the smallest commot of all he had seen with fewer than halfadozen cottages and a little grazing plot for a handful of sheep and cattle a knot of men were gathered by the sheepfold as taran rode closer he saw their faces tightly drawn and grim perplexed at this he called out his name and told them he brought pottery from annlaw clayshaper greetings to you said one man naming himself as drudwas son of pebyr and farewell in the same breath he added our thanks to annlaw and yourself but stay to share our hospitality and you may stay to shed your blood outlaws rove the hills drudwas went on quickly answering tarans questioning frown a band perhaps a dozen strong we have heard they plundered two commots already and not content were they with a sheep or cow for their own food but slaughtered all the herd for the joy of it today not long past i saw horsemen over the rise and leading them a yellowhaired ruffian on a sorrel mare dorath taran cried how then asked one of the commot men do you know this band if its doraths company i know them well enough taran answered they are paid swords and if none will hire them i judge them glad to kill even without fee hard warriors they are as i have seen them and cruel as the huntsmen of annuvin drudwas nodded gravely so it is said it may be they will pass us by he went on but this i doubt commot isav is small prey but where defenders are few the reasons to attack are all the more taran glanced at the men from their faces and bearing he knew their courage would not lack but once more he heard doraths laughter and recalled the mans cunning and ruthlessness and if they attack he asked what shall you do what would you have us do drudwas angrily burst out offer tribute and beg them to spare us give our animals to their swords and our homes to their torches commot isav has ever been at peace our pride is husbandry not warfare but we mean to stand against them have we better choice i can ride back to merin taran replied and bring you help too far and too long drudwas answered nor would i do so even then for it would leave merin illdefended no we stand as we are against twelve seven my son llassar he began indicating a tall eagerfaced boy scarcely older than taran had been when coll first dubbed him assistant pigkeeper your count is amiss taran interrupted you are not seven but nine gurgi and i stand with you drudwas shook his head you owe us no service or duty wanderer we welcome your swords but will not ask for them they are yours nonetheless taran replied and gurgi nodded agreement will you heed me nine may stand against a dozen and win the day but with dorath number counts less than skill were he alone i would still fear him as much as twelve he will fight shrewdly and strive to gain the most at least cost we must answer him in kind the commot men listened carefully as taran then spoke of a ruse to make the raiders believe themselves outnumbered and to attack where dorath would expect no more than feeble defense if two men were to lie waiting in the sheepfold and two in the cattle pen ready to spring up taran said they might take the band unawares and hold them a few moments while the rest of us attack from ambush in the rear at the same time if the women of your households set up a din with rakes and hoes it would seem other swordsmen had hastened to join us drudwas thought a long moment then nodded your plan may be sound wanderer but i fear for those in the pens as they must bear the brunt for all of us if aught should go awry small chance of escape would they have i shall be one to keep watch in the sheepfold taran began and i the other llassar broke in quickly drudwas frowned i would not spare you because you are my son you are a good lad and gentle with the flock i think of your years the flock is in my charge llassar cried by right my place is with the wanderer the men spoke hurriedly among themselves at last agreeing that llassar would keep watch with taran while drudwas stood guard over the cattle along with gurgi who fearful though he was refused to be any farther from tarans side by the time all plans were set and the commot men posted among the trees just beyond the sheepfold a full moon had risen above thin clouds the cold light sharpened the edges of the shadows and the outlines of brush and branches in the fold taran and llassar crouched amid the restless flock for a time neither spoke in the bright moonlight the face of llassar seemed to taran more boyish than before he saw the youth was afraid and making all effort to hide it though uneasy himself he grinned assuringly at llassar drudwashad been right the boy was young untried and yet taran smiled knowing that he himself at llassars age would have claimed the same right your plan is good wanderer llassar said at last in a hushed voice speaking taran knew more to ease his own disquiet than anything else better than we should have done it can not fail all plans can fail taran said almost harshly he fell silent then fears had begun stirring in him like leaves in a chill wind sweat drenched his body under the fleece jacket he had come to isav unknown unproven yet the men of the commot had willingly heeded him and willingly put their fate in his hands they had accepted his plan when another might have served better should it fail though all their lives could be forfeit the blame would be his alone he gripped the hilt of his sword and strained his eyes to peer into the darkness there was no movement and even the shadows seemed frozen you are called wanderer llassar went on quietly with some shyness to my mind one who wanders must as well be one who seeks is this true taran shook his head i sought once to be a smith and once to be a weaver and once a potter but that is over now perhaps i must wander without seeking if you seek nothing llassar said with a friendly laugh then you have little chance of finding it our life is not easy here he went on it is not willingness that lacks but knowledge the sons of don have long held prydain against the lord of annuvin and for their protection we are grateful yet the secrets arawn deathlord stole from us to regain them my father says would give us stouter shield and sword than even the battle hosts of prince gwydion himself but for all that isav is my home and i am wellcontent in it llassar grinned i do not envy you wanderer taran did not answer for a time then he murmured no it is i who envy you they said no more listening alertly to every sound as the night wore away and the moon fading behind thickening clouds lost shape and its light spread like pale mist in a while llassar blew out his breath in relief they will not come he said they will pass us by even as he spoke the darkness shattered in fragments that turned into the figures of armed warriors taran sprang to his feet as the gate burst open taran sounded his battle horn then flung himself upon the warrior who cried out in surprise and stumbled backward llassar had leaped up at the same instant as taran and the shepherd plunged against the press of the attackers at the gate thrusting with his spear taran struck out blindly struggling not only against the raiders but against the sudden terror that his plan had failed that the outlaws had come too silently too swiftly in another moment above the frantic bleating of the frightened animals a great shout burst from the commot men as they rose from the cover of the trees and from the huts came the clash of iron upon iron at the sheepfold the outlaws hesitated llassars opponent had fallen taran glimpsed the boy spring past him and strike again with his spear the attack wavered at the gate as the raiders turned their weapons against the men of isav but one warrior growling like a wild beast long knife upraised raced into the pen as if to wreak all the destruction he could and taran grappled with the man who spun about and slashed at him it was gloff the warrior recognized him gloffs first astonishment changed to an ugly grin almost of pleasure and eagerness as he shifted the knife in his hand gloff lunged and taran flung up his weapon to ward against the blow but the warrior leaped forward his free hand clawing at tarans eyes and his blade flickered as its point drove swiftly in a killing stroke a figure plunged between them it was llassar taran shouted a warning as the boy strove to catch the blow on his spear shaft snarling gloff turned his attack and struck viciously at llassar the shepherd fell with a cry of rage taran raised his sword suddenly drudwas was beside him gloff shrieked as the blade of the husbandman chopped downward under the onslaught of the commot folk doraths warriors fell back amid the turmoil of racing men taran found himself borne away from the fold daring a backward glance he could glimpse neither drudwas nor llassar in fury he pressed onward torches flared and he saw that the women and girls of isav had joined their men flailing with hoes rakes and pitchforks at the raiders taran cast about for gurgi and shouted his name but his voice was drowned in the tumult a fierce bellowing had risen from the cattle pen as a dark shape burst through the bars taran gasped in astonishment to see a furious black bull heaving and plunging among the raiders on its back clung gurgi yelling at the top of his voice kicking his heels against the powerful animals flanks turning its charge against the terrified remainder of doraths band they flee shouted one of the commot men taran pressed ahead the raiders who had left their mounts at the fringe of trees now hastened to gain them caught between the commot folk and the slashing horns of the enraged bull taran glimpsed dorath astride the sorrel mare and ran to overtake him but dorath spurred the steed and galloped into the wood taran turned and raced to the stables whistling for melynlas one of the commot men caught at his arm and cried the day is ours wanderer only then did taran realize the sounds of the fray had ceased dorath himself had vanished taran hurried to the sheepfold where the wife of drudwas knelt her arms about her son llassar taran cried in dismay dropping beside the shepherd the boys eyes opened and he strove to grin at taran his wound is not deep said drudwas he will live to tend his flock and so i will llassar said to taran and thanks to you ill have a flock to tend taran put a hand on the boys shoulder and to you he answered to you i owe much more than sheep full half the band will plunder no longer said drudwas neither commot isav nor any commot the rest are scattered and it will be long before their wounds heal you have well served us wanderer you and your companion you came among us strangers we count you strangers no longer but friends chapter the mirror although the folk of isav urged him to linger taran took leave of them and rode slowly back to merin the defeat of doraths company held no savor for his thoughts still turned restlessly his questions still found no answers and he was more downhearted than ever to annlaw he said little of his deeds in isav and it was gurgi bursting with pride who told what had befallen them yes yes cried gurgi wicked robbers fled with yellings oh they feared kindly master and feared bold gurgi too and great bull with stampings and trampings sharp horns with jabbings and stabbings you should be wellcontent wanderer annlaw said to taran who had remained silent all the while youve saved honest folk their lives and homes drudwas told me i was no stranger but a friend for that i am glad taran answered i only wish he added that i werent a stranger to myself what use am i he burst out to myself to anyone none that i can see the folk of isav would gainsay you the potter answered and there might be others who would welcome a stout blade and a bold heart a hired sword taran replied bitterly and follow the same way as dorath he shook his head when i was a child i dreamed of adventure glory of honor in feats of arms i think now that these things are shadows if you see them as shadows then you see them for what they are annlaw agreed many have pursued honor and in the pursuit lost more of it than ever they could gain but i did not mean a hired sword he stopped abruptly and was thoughtful a moment to see them for what they are he murmured returning to his first words perhaps perhaps the potter looked closely at taran the commot lore tells how one may see himself for what he is whether it be true or no more than an old wives tale i will not judge the potter went on slowly but the lore says that he who would know himself need only gaze in the mirror of llunet though annlaw had spoken quietly taran heard the potters words like a thunderclap the mirror of llunet taran cried since leaving craddocs valley he had put away all thought of the mirror hidden and forgotten it and the days had covered it as dead leaves on a burial mound the mirror he repeated in a stifled voice the goal of my quest from the beginning i had given up searching now do i find it when i seek it least of all your quest annlaw said perplexed he had risen and was watching taran with concern of this you have told me nothing wanderer i would have no pride in the telling taran replied but now as annlaw listened quietly a look of kindness on his face little by little taran was able to speak of caer dallben of orddu of where the quest had led him of craddocs death and his own despair once taran concluded i would have asked nothing better than to find the mirror now even if it were in my hand i would dread to look in it i understand your fears the potter answered quietly the mirror may put your heart at ease or trouble you all the more such is the risk the choice must be yours but know this wanderer annlaw went on as taran bit his lips in silence it is not such a mirror as you think it lies close by here in the llawgadarn mountains no more than two days distance in a cave at the head of the lake of llunet the mirror of llunet is a pool of water a pool of water taran cried what enchantment gives it power for enchanted it must be it is answered the potter to those who deem it so what of yourself taran asked in a low voice have you sought to look in it that i have not replied annlaw for i well know who i am annlaw clayshaper for better or worse that knowledge must serve me my lifetime and i taran murmured what knowledge will serve mine he said nothing for a time at last he raised his head it is true i fear to look in the mirror and fear to know what it might tell me but i have already known shame he flung out bitterly must i know cowardice as well in the morning taran continued in the morning i journey to the mirror of llunet his decision gave him little comfort at first light as he and gurgi saddled their mounts his doubts chilled him more than the cold mist of late autumn nevertheless having made his choice he set a swift pace riding northward from merin to the llawgadarn mountains taking his bearings on the high peak of mount meledin for it was at the foot of meledin as annlaw told him that he would find the cave the companions rode silently and steadily halting only when the day had so far waned they could no longer guide the steeds along the paths they camped on the soft carpet of pine needles but a deep uneasiness had settled on the two wayfarers and they slept little at dawn of the next day they gathered up their gear and rode at a good pace along the crest of a ridge soon taran called out and pointed downward the lake of llunet stretched in a long oval gleaming in the early sun its waters were calm blue and the lake itself seemed a perfect mirror that held the treelined shore in its depths at some distance mount meledin rose tall but seeming almost weightless in the mist still clinging to its long slopes tarans heart beat faster as the companions made their way downward to the shore closer to meledin the land fell in sharp drops and short stretches of meadow broke into shallow ravines near a stream tumbling from the upper reaches of the mountain the companions tethered their steeds taran had already sighted the cave and hastened toward it with gurgi scrambling after him there taran cried there the mirror at the foot of meledin wind and weather had carved an arching cave little more than a few paces deep rivulets trickled from the mossgrown rocks of its overhanging brow taran raced toward it his heart pounded his pulse burnt in his wrists yet as he drew closer his pace slowed and fear weighed heavy as a chain about his legs at the mouth of the cave he halted a long moment gurgi glanced anxiously at him it is here taran murmured he stepped forward within a shallow basin hollowed in the floor of smooth stones lay the mirror of llunet like a shield of polished silver gleaming of itself despite the shadows taran slowly knelt at the rim the basin held no more than a fingers depth of water fed drop by drop from a thread of moisture twining down the rocky wall the passing of countless years had not filled it to the brim yet shallow though it was the water seemed a depthless crystal whose facets turned one upon the other each catching brilliant beams of white scarcely daring to breathe lest he trouble the shining surface taran bent closer the cave was utterly silent and it seemed that even the falling of a wisp of dry moss would shatter the reflection his hands trembled as he saw his own face travelworn and sunscorched with all his heart he longed to turn away but forced himself to look more deeply were his eyes playing tricks on him closer he knelt what he saw made him cry out in disbelief at the same instant gurgi shrieked in terror taran leaped to his feet and spun around as gurgi ran and cowered at his side before him stood dorath the mans face was stubblebearded his dirty yellow hair hung into his eyes the horsehide jacket was slashed along one side and mud crusted his boots in one hand he held food which he scooped up with his fingers and crammed into his mouth he grinned at taran well met lord swineherd dorath said between mouthfuls illmet dorath taran cried drawing his sword will you call your company to set upon us call them then all who fled us at commot isav he raised the weapon and strode forward dorath laughed harshly will you strike before my own blade is out draw it then taran flung back at him so i shall when my meal is done dorath said he gave a scornful grunt your blade is illfavored swineherd uglier than gloffs face he grinned slyly mine is the fairer weapon yet gained at no cost my company he added would you have me call them they are deaf for half of them the dirt of their graves stops their ears i saw you at isav and guessed it was you who rallied the commot clods alas i had no time to linger and pay my greetings to you dorath wiped his mouth on the back of his hand of those who rode from isav two cowards fled and ive seen none of them two were heavily wounded those i myself sped on their journey to the carrion crows and they burden me no longer but no matter ill soon find others to join me meantime so much the better he went on ill share your treasure with none but myself treasure taran cried there is no treasure draw your blade dorath or ill kill you unarmed as youd have done to me an end to your lying swineherd dorath growled do you still take me for a fool ive known of your travels and the bent path you followed here did not deceive me your saddlebags hold nothing of worth ive seen that for myself so the prize is yet to be claimed he strode to the mirror is this your trove what have you found swineherd a mud puddle what does it hide taran cried out though before he could fling himself upon dorath the warrior stamped his heavy boot into the pool and with a curse sent the water spurting from the basin it holds nothing dorath burst out his face twisting in rage taran gasped and stumbled forward dorath drew his sword my meal is ended swineherd dorath cried he struck heavily and the force of his onslaught sent taran reeling from the cave gurgi yelled in fury and clutched at the warrior who seized him with a powerful grasp and dashed him against the rocky wall snarling dorath sprang after taran scrambling to his feet taran brought up his blade to meet the warriors attack dorath spat and lunged again driving taran toward the slope as the warrior bore closer upon him taran lost his footing stumbled backward and dropped to one knee with a mocking laugh dorath raised his weapon and taran saw the blade that once had been his own glint sharply as dorath swung it down with all his strength taran saw his death upon him and flung up his sword in a last attempt to ward against the blow the blades met with a grating ringing clash tarans weapon shuddered in his hand the shock threw him to earth yet his blade held the sword of dorath shattered on it cursing dorath flung the useless hilt at tarans face turned and ran to the cover of pines along the shore hearing her masters whistle doraths sorrel mare broke from the trees taran sprang to pursue the fleeing warrior help help gurgis voice cried from the cave kindly master oh help wounded gurgi hearing this taran halted even as dorath leaped astride his mount and galloped away taran raced to the cave within gurgi moaned and tried to sit up taran knelt quickly and saw the creatures forehead was heavily gashed but that gurgis pain came more from terror than from his hurts he carried him from the cave and propped him against a boulder taran did not return to the mirror of llunet already he had seen it empty its spattered water spread over the stones holding only the muddy print of doraths boot he sank down beside gurgi and put his head in his hands for long he did not move or speak come he said at last helping gurgi to his feet come we have far to journey a light glowed in annlaws hut the night was nearly spent yet taran saw the potter still bent over his wheel annlaw rose to his feet as taran slowly crossed the threshold neither spoke for some while the potter anxiously studied tarans face and said at last have you looked into the mirror wanderer taran nodded for a few moments but none shall look in it again it is destroyed he told of dorath and the happenings at the lake of llunet when taran had done the potter sadly shook his head you saw nothing then said annlaw i learned what i sought to learn taran replied i will not question you wanderer said annlaw but if it is in your heart to tell me i will listen i saw myself taran answered in the time i watched i saw strength and frailty pride and vanity courage and fear of wisdom a little of folly much of intentions many good ones but many more left undone in this alas i saw myself a man like any other but this too i saw he went on alike as men may seem each is different as flakes of snow no two the same you told me you had no need to seek the mirror knowing you were annlaw clayshaper now i know who i am myself and none other i am taran annlaw did not reply immediately then he said if you have learned this you have learned the deepest secret the mirror could tell you perhaps it was truly enchanted after all there was no enchantment taran answered he smiled it was a pool of water the most beautiful i have seen but a pool of water no more than that at first he went on i thought orddu had sent a fool on a fools errand she did not she meant me to see what the mirror showed me any stream any river would have given me the same reflection but i would not have understood it then as i understand it now as for my parentage he added it makes little difference true kinship has naught to do with blood ties however strong they be i think we are all kin brothers and sisters one to the other all children of all parents and the birthright i once sought i seek it no longer the folk of the free commots taught me well that manhood is not given but earned even king smoit in cantrev cadiffor told me this but i did not heed him llonio said life was a net for luck to hevydd the smith life was a forge and to dwyvach the weaverwoman a loom they spoke truly for it is all of these but you taran said his eyes meeting the potters you have shown me life is one thing more it is clay to be shaped as raw clay on a potters wheel annlaw nodded and you wanderer how will you shape your clay i can not stay in merin taran replied much as i love it caer dallben waits for me as it has always waited my life is there and gladly i return to it for i have been too long away they sat silently then taran gurgi and annlaw clayshaper as dawn lightened taran clasped the potters hand and bade him farewell good journey to you wanderer called annlaw as taran swung astride melynlas do not forget us for we shall not forget you i have the sword i fashioned taran proudly cried the cloak i wove and the bowl i shaped and the friendship of those in the fairest land of prydain no man can find greater treasure melynlas pawed the ground impatient and taran gave the stallion rein thus taran rode from merin with gurgi at his side and as he did it seemed he could hear voices calling to him remember us remember us he turned once but merin was far behind and out of sight from the hills a wind had risen driving the scattered leaves before it bearing homeward to caer dallben taran followed it
