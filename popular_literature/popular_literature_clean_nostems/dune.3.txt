children of dune frank herbert muaddibs teachings have become the playground of scholastics of the superstitious and the corrupt he taught a balanced way of life a philosophy with which a human can meet problems arising from an everchanging universe he said humankind is still evolving in a process which will never end he said this evolution moves on changing principles which are known only to eternity how can corrupted reasoning play with such an essence words of the mentat duncan idaho a spot of light appeared on the deep red rug which covered the raw rock of the cave floor the light glowed without apparent source having its existence only on the red fabric surface woven of spice fiber a questing circle about two centimeters in diameter it moved erratically now elongated now an oval encountering the deep green side of a bed it leaped upward folded itself across the beds surface beneath the green covering lay a child with rusty hair face still round with baby fat a generous mouth a figure lacking the lean sparseness of fremen tradition but not as waterfat as an offworlder as the light passed across closed eyelids the small figure stirred the light winked out now there was only the sound of even breathing and faint behind it a reassuring dripdripdrip of water collecting in a catch basin from the windstill far above the cave again the light appeared in the chamber slightly larger a few lumens brighter this time there was a suggestion of source and movement to it a hooded figure filled the arched doorway at the chambers edge and the light originated there once more the light flowed around the chamber testing questing there was a sense of menace in it a restless dissatisfaction it avoided the sleeping child paused on the gridded air inlet at an upper corner probed a bulge in the green and gold wall hangings which softened the enclosing rock presently the light winked out the hooded figure moved with a betraying swish of fabric took up a station at one side of the arched doorway anyone aware of the routine here in sietch tabr would have suspected at once that this must be stilgar naib of the sietch guardian of the orphaned twins who would one day take up the mantle of their father paul muaddib stilgar often made night inspections of the twins quarters always going first to the chamber where ghanima slept and ending here in the adjoining room where he could reassure himself that leto was not threatened im an old fool stilgar thought he fingered the cold surface of the light projector before restoring it to the loop in his belt sash the projector irritated him even while he depended upon it the thing was a subtle instrument of the imperium a device to detect the presence of large living bodies it had shown only the sleeping children in the royal bedchambers stilgar knew his thoughts and emotions were like the light he could not still a restless inner projection some greater power controlled that movement it projected him into this moment where he sensed the accumulated peril here lay the magnet for dreams of grandeur throughout the known universe here lay temporal riches secular authority and that most powerful of all mystic talismans the divine authenticity of muaddibs religious bequest in these twins leto and his sister ghanima an awesome power focused while they lived muaddib though dead lived in them these were not merely nineyearold children they were a natural force objects of veneration and fear they were the children of paul atreides who had become muaddib the mahdi of all the fremen muaddib had ignited an explosion of humanity fremen had spread from this planet in a jihad carrying their fervor across the human universe in a wave of religious government whose scope and ubiquitous authority had left its mark on every planet yet these children of muaddib are flesh and blood stilgar thought two simple thrusts of my knife would still their hearts their water would return to the tribe his wayward mind fell into turmoil at such a thought to kill muaddibs children but the years had made him wise in introspection stilgar knew the origin of such a terrible thought it came from the left hand of the damned not from the right hand of the blessed the ayat and burhan of life held few mysteries for him once hed been proud to think of himself as fremen to think of the desert as a friend to name his planet dune in his thoughts and not arrakis as it was marked on all of the imperial star charts how simple things were when our messiah was only a dream he thought by finding our mahdi we loosed upon the universe countless messianic dreams every people subjugated by the jihad now dreams of a leader to come stilgar glanced into the darkened bedchamber if my knife liberated all of those people would they make a messiah of me leto could be heard stirring restlessly in his bed stilgar sighed he had never known the atreides grandfather whose name this child had taken but many said the moral strength of muaddib had come from that source would that terrifying quality of rightness skip a generation now stilgar found himself unable to answer this question he thought sietch tabr is mine i rule here i am a naib of the fremen without me there would have been no muaddib these twins now through chani their mother and my kinswoman my blood flows in their veins i am there with muaddib and chani and all the others what have we done to our universe stilgar could not explain why such thoughts came to him in the night and why they made him feel so guilty he crouched within his hooded robe reality was not at all like the dream the friendly desert which once had spread from pole to pole was reduced to half its former size the mythic paradise of spreading greenery filled him with dismay it was not like the dream and as his planet changed he knew he had changed he had become a far more subtle person than the onetime sietch chieftain he was aware now of many things of statecraft and profound consequences in the smallest decisions yet he felt this knowledge and subtlety as a thin veneer covering an iron core of simpler more deterministic awareness and that older core called out to him pleaded with him for a return to cleaner values the morning sounds of the sietch began intruding upon his thoughts people were beginning to move about in the cavern he felt a breeze against his cheeks people were going out through the doorseals into the predawn darkness the breeze spoke of carelessness as it spoke of the time warren dwellers no longer maintained the tight water discipline of the old days why should they when rain had been recorded on this planet when clouds were seen when eight fremen had been inundated and killed by a flash flood in a wadi until that event the word drowned had not existed in the language of dune but this was no longer dune this was arrakis and it was the morning of an eventful day he thought jessica mother of muaddib and grandmother of these royal twins returns to our planet today why does she end her selfimposed exile at this time why does she leave the softness and security of caladan for the dangers of arrakis and there were other worries would she sense stilgars doubts she was a bene gesserit witch graduate of the sisterhoods deepest training and a reverend mother in her own right such females were acute and they were dangerous would she order him to fall upon his own knife as the ummaprotector of lietkynes had been ordered would i obey her he wondered he could not answer that question but now he thought about lietkynes the planetologist who had first dreamed of transforming the planetwide desert of dune into the humansupportive green planet which it was becoming lietkynes had been chanis father without him there would have been no dream no chani no royal twins the workings of this fragile chain dismayed stilgar how have we met in this place he asked himself how have we combined for what purpose is it my duty to end it all to shatter that great combination stilgar admitted the terrible urging within him now he could make that choice denying love and family to do what a naib must do on occasion make a deadly decision for the good of the tribe by one view such a murder represented ultimate betrayal and atrocity to kill mere children yet they were not mere children they had eaten melange had shared in the sietch orgy had probed the desert for sandtrout and played the other games of fremen children and they sat in the royal council children of such tender years yet wise enough to sit in the council they might be children in flesh but they were ancient in experience born with a totality of genetic memory a terrifying awareness which set their aunt alia and themselves apart from all other living humans many times in many nights had stilgar found his mind circling this difference shared by the twins and their aunt many times had he been awakened from sleep by these torments coming here to the twins bedchambers with his dreams unfinished now his doubts came to focus failure to make a decision was in itself a decision he knew this these twins and their aunt had awakened in the womb knowing there all of the memories passed onto them by their ancestors spice addiction had done this spice addiction of the mothers the lady jessica and chani the lady jessica had borne a son muaddib before her addiction alia had come after the addiction that was clear in retrospect the countless generations of selective breeding directed by the bene gesserits had achieved muaddib but nowhere in the sisterhoods plans had they allowed for melange oh they knew about this possibility but they feared it and called it abomination that was the most dismaying fact abomination they must possess reasons for such a judgment and if they said alia was an abomination then that must apply equally to the twins because chani too had been addicted her body saturated with spice and her genes had somehow complemented those of muaddib stilgars thoughts moved in ferment there could be no doubt these twins went beyond their father but in which direction the boy spoke of an ability to be his father and had proved it even as an infant leto had revealed memories which only muaddib should have known were there other ancestors waiting in that vast spectrum of memories ancestors whose beliefs and habits created unspeakable dangers for living humans abominations the holy witches of the bene gesserit said yet the sisterhood coveted the genophase of these children the witches wanted sperm and ovum without the disturbing flesh which carried them was that why the lady jessica returned at this time she had broken with the sisterhood to support her ducal mate but rumor said she had returned to the bene gesserit ways i could end all of these dreams stilgar thought how simple it would be and yet again he wondered at himself that he could contemplate such a choice were muaddibs twins responsible for the reality which obliterated the dreams of others no they were merely the lens through which light poured to reveal new shapes in the universe in torment his mind reverted to primary fremen beliefs and he thought gods command comes so seek not to hasten it gods it is to show the way and some do swerve from it it was the religion of muaddib which upset stilgar most why did they make a god of muaddib why deify a man known to be flesh muaddibs golden elixir of life had created a bureaucratic monster which sat astride human affairs government and religion united and breaking a law became sin a smell of blasphemy arose like smoke around any questioning of governmental edicts the guilt of rebellion invoked hellfire and selfrighteous judgments yet it was men who created these governmental edicts stilgar shook his head sadly not seeing the attendants who had moved into the royal antechamber for their morning duties he fingered the crysknife at his waist thinking of the past it symbolized thinking that more than once he had sympathized with rebels whose abortive uprisings had been crushed by his own orders confusion washed through his mind and he wished he knew how to obliterate it returning to the simplicities represented by the knife but the universe would not turn backward it was a great engine projected upon the grey void of nonexistence his knife if it brought the deaths of the twins would only reverberate against that void weaving new complexities to echo through human history creating new surges of chaos inviting humankind to attempt other forms of order and disorder stilgar sighed growing aware of the movements around him yes these attendants represented a kind of order which was bound around muaddibs twins they moved from one moment to the next meeting whatever necessities occurred there best to emulate them stilgar told himself best meet what comes when it comes i am an attendant yet he told himself and my master is god the merciful the compassionate and he quoted to himself surely we have put on their necks fetters up to the chin so their heads are raised and we have put before them a barrier and behind them a barrier and we have covered them so they do not see thus was it written in the old fremen religion stilgar nodded to himself to see to anticipate the next moment as muaddib had done with his awesome visions of the future added a counterforce to human affairs it created new places for decisions to be unfettered yes that might well indicate a whim of god another complexity beyond ordinary human reach stilgar removed his hand from the knife his fingers tingled with remembrance of it but the blade which once had glistened in a sandworms gaping mouth remained in its sheath stilgar knew he would not draw this blade now to kill the twins he had reached a decision better to retain that one old virtue which he still cherished loyalty better the complexities one thought he knew than the complexities which defied understanding better the now than the future of a dream the bitter taste in his mouth told stilgar how empty and revolting some dreams could be no no more dreams challenge have you seen the preacher response i have seen a sandworm challenge what about that sandworm response it gives us the air we breathe challenge then why do we destroy its land response because shaihulud sandworm deified orders it riddles of arrakis by harq alada as was the fremen custom the atreides twins arose an hour before dawn they yawned and stretched in secret unison in their adjoining chambers feeling the activity of the cavewarren around them they could hear attendants in the antechamber preparing breakfast a simple gruel with dates and nuts blended in liquid skimmed from partially fermented spice there were glowglobes in the antechamber and a soft yellow light entered through the open archways of the bedchambers the twins dressed swiftly in the soft light each hearing the other nearby as they had agreed they donned stillsuits against the deserts parching winds presently the royal pair met in the antechamber noting the sudden stillness of the attendants leto it was observed wore a blackedged tan cape over his stillsuits grey slickness his sister wore a green cape the neck of each cape was held by a clasp in the form of an atreides hawk gold with red jewels for eyes seeing this finery harah who was one of stilgars wives said i see you have dressed to honor your grandmother leto picked up his breakfast bowl before looking at harahs dark and windcreased face he shook his head then how do you know its not ourselves we honor harah met his taunting stare without flinching said my eyes are just as blue as yours ghanima laughed aloud harah was always an adept at the fremen challengegame in one sentence she had said dont taunt me boy you may be royalty but we both bear the stigma of melangeaddiction eyes without whites what fremen needs more finery or more honor than that leto smiled shook his head ruefully harah my love if you were but younger and not already stilgars id make you my own harah accepted the small victory easily signaling the other attendants to continue preparing the chambers for this days important activities eat your breakfasts she said youll need the energy today then you agree that were not too fine for our grandmother ghanima asked speaking around a mouthful of gruel dont fear her ghani harah said leto gulped a mouthful of gruel sent a probing stare at harah the woman was infernally folkwise seeing through the game of finery so quickly will she believe we fear her leto asked like as not harah said she was our reverend mother remember i know her ways how was alia dressed ghanima asked ive not seen her harah spoke shortly turning away leto and ghanima exchanged a look of shared secrets bent quickly to their breakfast presently they went out into the great central passage ghanima spoke in one of the ancient languages they shared in genetic memory so today we have a grandmother it bothers alia greatly leto said who likes to give up such authority ghanima asked leto laughed softly an oddly adult sound from flesh so young its more than that will her mothers eyes observe what we have observed and why not leto asked yes that could be what alia fears who knows abomination better than abomination leto asked we could be wrong you know ghanima said but were not and he quoted from the bene gesserit azhar book it is with reason and terrible experience that we call the preborn abomination for who knows what lost and damned persona out of our evil past may take over the living flesh i know the history of it ghanima said but if thats true why dont we suffer from this inner assault perhaps our parents stand guard within us leto said then why not guardians for alia as well i dont know it could be because one of her parents remains among the living it could be simply that we are still young and strong perhaps when were older and more cynical we must take great care with this grandmother ghanima said and not discuss this preacher who wanders our planet speaking heresy you dont really think hes our father i make no judgment on it but alia fears him ghanima shook her head sharply i dont believe this abomination nonsense youve just as many memories as i have leto said you can believe what you want to believe you think its because we havent dared the spice trance and alia has ghanima said thats exactly what i think they fell silent moving out into the flow of people in the central passage it was cool in sietch tabr but the stillsuits were warm and the twins kept their condenser hoods thrown back from their red hair their faces betrayed the stamp of shared genes generous mouths widely set eyes of spice addict blueonblue leto was first to note the approach of their aunt alia here she comes now he said shifting to atreides battle language as a warning ghanima nodded to her aunt as alia stopped in front of them said a spoil of war greets her illustrious relative using the same chakobsa language ghanima emphasized the meaning of her own name spoil of war you see beloved aunt leto said we prepare ourselves for todays encounter with your mother alia the one person in the teeming royal household who harbored not the faintest surprise at adult behavior from these children glared from one to the other then hold your tongues both of you alias bronze hair was pulled back into two golden water rings her oval face held a frown the wide mouth with its downturned hint of selfindulgence was held in a tight line worry wrinkles fanned the corners of her blueonblue eyes ive warned both of you how to behave today alia said you know the reasons as well as i we know your reasons but you may not know ours ghanima said ghani alia growled leto glared at his aunt said today of all days we will not pretend to be simpering infants no one wants you to simper alia said but we think it unwise for you to provoke dangerous thoughts in my mother irulan agrees with me who knows what role the lady jessica will choose she is after all bene gesserit leto shook his head wondering why does alia not see what we suspect is she too far gone and he made special note of the subtle genemarkers on alias face which betrayed the presence of her maternal grandfather the baron vladimir harkonnen had not been a pleasant person at this observation leto felt the vague stirrings of his own disquiet thinking my own ancestor too he said the lady jessica was trained to rule ghanima nodded why does she choose this time to come back alia scowled then is it possible she merely wants to see her grandchildren ghanima thought thats what you hope my dear aunt but its damned well not likely she can not rule here alia said she has caladan that should be enough ghanima spoke placatingly when our father went into the desert to die he left you as regent he have you any complaint alia demanded it was a reasonable choice leto said following his sisters lead you were the one person who knew what it was like to be born as we were born its rumored that my mother has returned to the sisterhood alia said and you both knew what the bene gesserit think about abomination leto said yes alia bit the word off once a witch always a witch so its said ghanima said sister you play a dangerous game leto thought but he followed her lead saying our grandmother was a woman of greater simplicity than others of her kind you share her memories alia surely you must know what to expect simplicity alia said shaking her head looking around her at the thronged passage then back to the twins if my mother were less complex neither of you would be here nor i i would have been her firstborn and none of this a shrug half shudder moved her shoulders i warn you two be very careful what you do today alia looked up here comes my guard and you still dont think it safe for us to accompany you to the spaceport leto asked wait here alia said ill bring her back leto exchanged a look with his sister said youve told us many times that the memories we hold from those whove passed before us lack a certain usefulness until weve experienced enough with our own flesh to make them reality my sister and i believe this we anticipate dangerous changes with the arrival of our grandmother dont stop believing that alia said she turned away to be enclosed by her guards and they moved swiftly down the passage toward the state entrance where ornithopters awaited them ghanima wiped a tear from her right eye water for the dead leto whispered taking his sisters arm ghanima drew in a deep sighing breath thinking of how she had observed her aunt using the way she knew best from her own accumulation of ancestral experiences spice trance did it she asked knowing what leto would say do you have a better suggestion for the sake of argument why didnt our father or even our grandmother succumb he studied her a moment then you know the answer as well as i do they had secure personalities by the time they came to arrakis the spice trance well he shrugged they werent born into this world already possessed of their ancestors alia though why didnt she believe the bene gesserit warnings ghanima chewed her lower lip alia had the same information to draw upon that we do they already were calling her abomination leto said dont you find it tempting to find out if youre stronger than all of those no i dont ghanima looked away from her brothers probing stare shuddered she had only to consult her genetic memories and the sisterhoods warnings took on vivid shape the preborn observably tended to become adults of nasty habits and the likely cause again she shuddered pity we dont have a few preborn in our ancestry leto said perhaps we do but wed ahh yes the old unanswered question do we really have open access to every ancestors total file of experiences from his own inner turmoil leto knew how this conversation must be disturbing his sister theyd considered this question many times always without conclusion he said we must delay and delay and delay every time she urges the trance upon us extreme caution with a spice overdose thats our best course an overdose would have to be pretty large ghanima said our tolerance is probably high he agreed look how much alia requires i pity her ghanima said the lure of it mustve been subtle and insidious creeping up on her until shes a victim yes leto said abomination we could be wrong true i always wonder ghanima mused if the next ancestral memory i seek will be the one which the past is no farther away than your pillow leto said we must make the opportunity to discuss this with our grandmother so her memory within me urges leto said ghanima met his gaze then too much knowledge never makes for simple decisions the sietch at the deserts rim was liets was kyness was stilgars was muaddibs and once more was stilgars the naibs one by one sleep in the sand but the sietch endures from a fremen song alia felt her heart pounding as she walked away from the twins for a few pulsing seconds she had felt herself near compulsion to stay with them and beg their help what a foolish weakness memory of it sent a warning stillness through alia would these twins dare practice prescience the path which had engulfed their father must lure them spice trance with its visions of the future wavering like gauze blown on a fickle wind why can not i see the future alia wondered much as i try why does it elude me the twins must be made to try she told herself they could be lured into it they had the curiosity of children and it was linked to memories which traversed millennia just as i have alia thought her guards opened the moisture seals at the state entrance of the sietch stood aside as she emerged onto the landing lip where the ornithopters waited there was a wind from the desert blowing dust across the sky but the day was bright emerging from the glowglobes of the sietch into the daylight sent her thoughts outward why was the lady jessica returning at this moment had stories been carried to caladan stories of how the regency was we must hurry my lady one of her guards said raising his voice above the wind sounds alia allowed herself to be helped into her ornithopter and secured the safety harness but her thoughts went leaping ahead why now as the ornithopters wings dipped and the craft went skidding into the air she felt the pomp and power of her position as physical things but they were fragile oh how fragile why now when her plans were not completed the dust mists drifted lifting and she could see the bright sunlight upon the changing landscape of the planet broad reaches of green vegetation where parched earth had once dominated without a vision of the future i could fail oh what magic i could perform if only i could see as paul saw not for me the bitterness which prescient visions brought a tormenting hunger shuddered through her and she wished she could put aside the power oh to be as others were blind in that safest of all blindnesses living only the hypnoidal halflife into which birthshock precipitated most humans but no she had been born an atreides victim of that eonsdeep awareness inflicted by her mothers spice addiction why does my mother return today gurney halleck would be with her ever the devoted servant the hired killer of ugly mien loyal and straightforward a musician who played murder with a sliptip or entertained with equal ease upon his ninestring baliset some said hed become her mothers lover that would be a thing to ferret out it might prove a most valuable leverage the wish to be as others were left her leto must be lured into the spice trance she recalled asking the boy how he would deal with gurney halleck and leto sensing undercurrents in her question had said halleck was loyal to a fault adding he adored my father shed noted the small hesitation leto had almost said me instead of my father yes it was hard at times to separate the genetic memory from the chord of living flesh gurney halleck would not make that separation easier for leto a harsh smile touched alias lips gurney had chosen to return to caladan with the lady jessica after pauls death his return would tangle many things coming back to arrakis he would add his own complexities to the existing lines he had served pauls father and thus the succession went leto i to paul to leto ii and out of the bene gesserit breeding program jessica to alia to ghanima a branching line gurney adding to the confusion of identities might prove valuable what would he do if he discovered we carry the blood of harkonnens the harkonnens he hates so bitterly the smile on alias lips became introspective the twins were after all children they were like children with countless parents whose memories belonged both to others and to self they would stand at the lip of sietch tabr and watch the track of their grandmothers ship landing in the arrakeen basin that burning mark of a ships passage visible on the sky would it make jessicas arrival more real for her grandchildren my mother will ask me about their training alia thought do i mix prana bindu disciplines with a judicious hand and i will tell her that they train themselves just as i did i will quote her grandson to her among the responsibilities of command is the necessity to punish but only when the victim demands it it came to alia then that if she could only focus the lady jessicas attention sharply enough onto the twins others might escape a closer inspection such a thing could be done leto was very much like paul and why not he could be paul whenever he chose even ghanima possessed this shattering ability just as i can be my mother or any of the others whove shared their lives with us she veered away from this thought staring out at the passing landscape of the shield wall then how was it to leave the warm safety of waterrich caladan and return to arrakis to this desert planet where her duke was murdered and her son died a martyr why did the lady jessica come back at this time alia found no answer nothing certain she could share anothers egoawareness but when experiences went their separate ways then motives diverged as well the stuff of decisions lay in the private actions taken by individuals for the preborn the manyborn atreides this remained the paramount reality in itself another kind of birth it was the absolute separation of living breathing flesh when that flesh left the womb which had afflicted it with multiple awareness alia saw nothing strange in loving and hating her mother simultaneously it was a necessity a required balance without room for guilt or blame where could loving or hating stop was one to blame the bene gesserit because they set the lady jessica upon a certain course guilt and blame grew diffuse when memory covered millennia the sisterhood had only been seeking to breed a kwisatz haderach the male counterpart of a fully developed reverend mother and more a human of superior sensitivity and awareness the kwisatz haderach who could be many places simultaneously and the lady jessica merely a pawn in that breeding program had the bad taste to fall in love with the breeding partner to whom she had been assigned responsive to her beloved dukes wishes she produced a son instead of the daughter which the sisterhood had commanded as the firstborn leaving me to be born after she became addicted to the spice and now they dont want me now they fear me with good reason theyd achieved paul their kwisatz haderach one lifetime too early a minor miscalculation in a plan that extended and now they had another problem the abomination who carried the precious genes theyd sought for so many generations alia felt a shadow pass across her glanced upward her escort was assuming the high guard position preparatory to landing she shook her head in wonderment at her wandering thoughts what good was served by calling up old lifetimes and rubbing their mistakes together this was a new lifetime duncan idaho had put his mentat awareness to the question of why jessica returned at this time evaluating the problem in the humancomputer fashion which was his gift he said she returned to take over the twins for the sisterhood the twins too carried those precious genes duncan could well be right that might be enough to take the lady jessica out of her selfimposed seclusion on caladan if the sisterhood commanded well why else would she come back to the scenes of so much that must be shatteringly painful to her we shall see alia muttered she felt the ornithopter touch down on the roof of her keep a positive and jarring punctuation which filled her with grim anticipation melange melange also malanj ns origin uncertain thought to derive from ancient terran franzh a mixture of spices b spice of arrakis dune with geriatric properties first noted by yanshuph ashkoko royal chemist in reign of shakkad the wise arrakeen melange found only in deepest desert sands of arrakis linked to prophetic visions of paul muaddib atreides first fremen mahdi also employed by spacing guild navigators and the bene gesserit dictionary royal fifth edition the two big cats came over the rocky ridge in the dawn light loping easily they were not really into the passionate hunt as yet merely looking over their territory they were called laza tigers a special breed brought here to the planet salusa secundus almost eight thousand years past genetic manipulation of the ancient terran stock had erased some of the original tiger features and refined other elements the fangs remained long their faces were wide eyes alert and intelligent the paws were enlarged to give them support on uneven terrain and their sheathed claws could extend some ten centimeters sharpened at the ends into razor tips by abrasive compression of the sheath their coats were a flat and even tan which made them almost invisible against sand they differed in another way from their ancestors servostimulators had been implanted in their brains while they were cubs the stimulators made them pawns of whoever possessed the transmitter it was cold and as the cats paused to scan the terrain their breath made fog on the air around them lay a region of salusa secundus left sere and barren a place which harbored a scant few sandtrout smuggled from arrakis and kept precariously alive in the dream that the melange monopoly might be broken where the cats stood the landscape was marked by tan rocks and a scattering of sparse bushes silvery green in the long shadows of the morning sun without the slightest movement the cats grew suddenly alert their eyes turned slowly left then their heads turned far down in the scarred land two children struggled up a dry wash hand in hand the children appeared to be of an age perhaps nine or ten standard years they were redhaired and wore stillsuits partly covered by rich white bourkas which bore all around the hem and at the forehead the hawk crest of the house atreides worked in flamejewel threads as they walked the children chattered happily and their voices carried clearly to the hunting cats the laza tigers knew this game they had played it before but they remained quiescent awaiting the triggering of the chase signal in their servostimulators now a man appeared on the ridgetop behind the cats he stopped and surveyed the scene cats children the man wore a sardaukar working uniform in grey and black with insignia of a levenbrech aide to a bashar a harness passed behind his neck and under his arms to carry the servotransmitter in a thin package against his chest where the keys could be reached easily by either hand the cats did not turn at his approach they knew this man by sound and smell he scrambled down to stop two paces from the cats mopped his forehead the air was cold but this was hot work again his pale eyes surveyed the scene cats children he pushed a damp strand of blond hair back under his black working helmet touched the implanted microphone in his throat the cats have them in sight the answering voice came to him through receivers implanted behind each ear we see them this time the levenbrech asked will they do it without a chase command the voice countered theyre ready the levenbrech said very well let us see if four conditioning sessions will be enough tell me when youre ready any time now then the levenbrech said he touched a red key on the right hand side of his servotransmitter first releasing a bar which shielded the key now the cats stood without any transmitted restraints he held his hand over a black key below the red one ready to stop the animals should they turn on him but they took no notice of him crouched and began working their way down the ridge toward the children their great paws slid out in smooth gliding motions the levenbrech squatted to observe knowing that somewhere around him a hidden transeye carried this entire scene to a secret monitor within the keep where his prince lived presently the cats began to lope then to run the children intent on climbing through the rocky terrain still had not seen their peril one of them laughed a high and piping sound in the clear air the other child stumbled and recovering balance turned and saw the cats the child pointed look both children stopped and stared at the interesting intrusion into their lives they were still standing when the laza tigers hit them one cat to each child the children died with a casual abruptness necks broken swiftly the cats began to feed shall i recall them the levenbrech asked let them finish they did well i knew they would this pair is superb best ive ever seen the levenbrech agreed very good then transport is being sent for you we will sign off now the levenbrech stood and stretched he refrained from looking directly off to the high ground on his left where a telltale glitter had revealed the location of the transeye which had relayed his fine performance to his bashar far away in the green lands of the capitol the levenbrech smiled there would be a promotion for this days work already he could feel a bators insignia at his neck and someday burseg even one day bashar people who served well in the corps of faradn grandson of the late shaddam iv earned rich promotions one day when the prince was seated on his rightful throne there would be even greater promotions a bashars rank might not be the end of it there were baronies and earldoms to be had on the many worlds of this realm once the twin atreides were removed the fremen must return to his original faith to his genius in forming human communities he must return to the past where that lesson of survival was learned in the struggle with arrakis the only business of the fremen should be that of opening his soul to the inner teachings the worlds of the imperium the landsraad and the choam confederacy have no message to give him they will only rob him of his soul the preacher at arrakeen all around the lady jessica reaching far out into the dun flatness of the landing plain upon which her transport rested crackling and sighing after its dive from space stood an ocean of humanity she estimated half a million people were there and perhaps only a third of them pilgrims they stood in awesome silence attention fixed on the transports exit platform whose shadowy hatchway concealed her and her party it lacked two hours until noon but already the air above that throng reflected a dusty shimmering in promise of the days heat jessica touched her silverflecked copper hair where it framed her oval face beneath the aba hood of a reverend mother she knew she did not look her best after the long trip and the black of the aba was not her best color but she had worn this garment here before the significance of the aba robe would not be lost upon the fremen she sighed space travel did not agree with her and thered been that added burden of memories the other trip from caladan to arrakis when her duke had been forced into this fief against his better judgment slowly probing with her bene gesserittrained ability to detect significant minutiae she scanned the sea of people there were stillsuit hoods of dull grey garments of fremen from the deep desert there were whiterobed pilgrims with penitence marks on their shoulders there were scattered pockets of rich merchants hoodless in light clothing to flaunt their disdain for water loss in arrakeens parching air and there was the delegation from the society of the faithful green robed and heavily hooded standing aloof within the sanctity of their own group only when she lifted her gaze from the crowd did the scene take on any similarity to that which had greeted her upon her arrival with her beloved duke how long ago had that been more than twenty years she did not like to think of those intervening heartbeats time lay within her like a dead weight and it was as though her years away from this planet had never been once more into the dragons mouth she thought here upon this plain her son had wrested the imperium from the late shaddam iv a convulsion of history had imprinted this place into mens minds and beliefs she heard the restless stirring of the entourage behind her and again she sighed they must wait for alia who had been delayed alias party could be seen now approaching from the far edge of the throng creating a human wave as a wedge of royal guards opened a passage jessica scanned the landscape once more many differences submitted to her searching stare a prayer balcony had been added to the landing fields control tower and visible far off to the left across the plain stood the awesome pile of plasteel which paul had built as his fortress his sietch above the sand it was the largest integrated single construction ever to rise from the hand of man entire cities could have been housed within its walls and room to spare now it housed the most powerful governing force in the imperium alias society of the faithful which she had built upon her brothers body that place must go jessica thought alias delegation had reached the foot of the exit ramp and stood there expectantly jessica recognized stilgars craggy features and god forfend there stood the princess irulan hiding her savagery in that seductive body with its cap of golden hair exposed by a vagrant breeze irulan seemed not to have aged a day it was an affront and there at the point of the wedge was alia her features impudently youthful her eyes staring upward into the hatchways shadows jessicas mouth drew into a straight line and she scanned her daughters face a leaden sensation pulsed through jessicas body and she heard the surf of her own life within her ears the rumors were true horrible horrible alia had fallen into the forbidden way the evidence was there for the initiate to read abomination in the few moments it took her to recover jessica realized how much she had hoped to find the rumors false what of the twins she asked herself are they lost too slowly as befitted the mother of a god jessica moved out of the shadows and onto the lip of the ramp her entourage remained behind as instructed these next few moments were the crucial ones jessica stood alone in full view of the throng she heard gurney halleck cough nervously behind her gurney had objected not even a shield on you gods below woman youre insane but among gurneys most valuable features was a core of obedience he would say his piece and then he would obey now he obeyed the human sea emitted a sound like the hiss of a giant sandworm as jessica emerged she raised her arms in the benedictory to which the priesthood had conditioned the imperium with significant pockets of tardiness but still like one giant organism the people sank to their knees even the official party complied jessica had marked out the places of delay and she knew that other eyes behind her and among her agents in the throng had memorized a temporary map with which to seek out the tardy as jessica remained with her arms upraised gurney and his men emerged they moved swiftly past her down the ramp ignoring the official partys startled looks joining the agents who identified themselves by handsign quickly they fanned out through the human sea leaping knots of kneeling figures dashing through narrow lanes a few of their targets saw the danger and tried to flee they were the easiest a thrown knife a garrote loop and the runners went down others were herded out of the press hands bound feet hobbled through it all jessica stood with arms outstretched blessing by her presence keeping the throng subservient she read the signs of spreading rumors though and knew the dominant one because it had been planted the reverend mother returns to weed out the slackers bless the mother of our lord when it was over a few dead bodies sprawled on the sand captives removed to holding pens beneath the landing tower jessica lowered her arms perhaps three minutes had elapsed she knew there was little likelihood gurney and his men had taken any of the ringleaders the ones who posed the most potent threat they would be the alert and sensitive ones but the captives would contain some interesting fish as well as the usual culls and dullards jessica lowered her arms and cheering the people surged to their feet as though nothing untoward had happened jessica walked alone down the ramp avoiding her daughter singling out stilgar for concentrated attention the black beard which fanned out across the neck of his stillsuit hood like a wild delta contained flecks of grey but his eyes carried that same whiteless intensity theyd presented to her on their first encounter in the desert stilgar knew what had just occurred and approved here stood a true fremen naib a leader of men and capable of bloody decisions his first words were completely in character welcome home my lady its always a pleasure to see direct and effective action jessica allowed herself a tiny smile close the port stil no one leaves until weve questioned those we took its already done my lady stilgar said gurneys man and i planned this together those were your men then the ones who helped some of them my lady she read the hidden reservations nodded you studied me pretty well in those old days stil as you once were at pains to tell me my lady one observes the survivors and learns from them alia stepped forward then and stilgar stood aside while jessica confronted her daughter knowing there was no way to hide what she had learned jessica did not even try concealment alia could read the minutiae when she needed could read as well as any adept of the sisterhood she would already know by jessicas behavior what had been seen and interpreted they were enemies for whom the word mortal touched only the surface alia chose anger as the easiest and most proper reaction how dare you plan an action such as this without consulting me she demanded pushing her face close to jessicas jessica spoke mildly as youve just heard gurney didnt even let me in on the whole plan it was thought and you stilgar alia said rounding on him to whom are you loyal my oath is to muaddibs children stilgar said speaking stiffly we have removed a threat to them and why doesnt that fill you with joy daughter jessica asked alia blinked glanced once at her mother suppressed the inner tempest and even managed a straighttoothed smile i am filled with joy mother she said and to her own surprise alia found that she was happy experiencing a terrible delight that it was all out in the open at last between herself and her mother the moment she had dreaded was past and the power balance had not really been changed we will discuss this in more detail at a more convenient time alia said speaking both to her mother and stilgar but of course jessica said turning with a movement of dismissal to face the princess irulan for a few brief heartbeats jessica and the princess stood silently studying each other two bene gesserits who had broken with the sisterhood for the same reason love both of them for love of men who now were dead this princess had loved paul in vain becoming his wife but not his mate and now she lived only for the children given to paul by his fremen concubine chani jessica spoke first where are my grandchildren at sietch tabr too dangerous for them here i understand irulan permitted herself a faint nod she had observed the interchange between jessica and alia but put upon it an interpretation for which alia had prepared her jessica has returned to the sisterhood and we both know they have plans for pauls children irulan had never been the most accomplished adept in the bene gesserit valuable more for the fact that she was a daughter of shaddam iv than for any other reason often too proud to exert herself in extending her capabilities now she chose sides with an abruptness which did no credit to her training really jessica irulan said the royal council should have been consulted it was wrong of you to work only through am i to believe none of you trust stilgar jessica asked irulan possessed the wit to realize there could be no answer to such a question she was glad that the priestly delegates unable to contain their impatience any longer pressed forward she exchanged a glance with alia thinking jessicas as haughty and certain of herself as ever a bene gesserit axiom arose unbidden in her mind though the haughty do but build castle walls behind which they try to hide their doubts and fears could that be true of jessica surely not then it must be a pose but for what purpose the question disturbed irulan the priests were noisy in their possession of muaddibs mother some only touched her arms but most bowed low and spoke greetings at last the leaders of the delegation took their turn with the most holy reverend mother accepting the ordained role the first shall be last with practiced smiles telling her that the official lustration ceremony awaited her at the keep pauls old fortressstronghold jessica studied the pair finding them repellent one was called javid a young man of surly features and round cheeks shadowed eyes which could not hide the suspicions lurking in their depths the other was zebataleph second son of a naib shed known in her fremen days as he was quick to remind her he was easily classified jollity linked with ruthlessness a thin face with blond beard an air about him of secret excitements and powerful knowledge javid she judged far more dangerous of the two a man of private counsel simultaneously magnetic and she could find no other word repellent she found his accents strange full of old fremen pronunciations as though hed come from some isolated pocket of his people tell me javid she said whence come you i am but a simple fremen of the desert he said every syllable giving the lie to the statement zebataleph intruded with an offensive deference almost mocking we have much to discuss of the old days my lady i was one of the first you know to recognize the holy nature of your sons mission but you werent one of his fedaykin she said no my lady i possessed a more philosophic bent i studied for the priesthood and insured the preservation of your skin she thought javid said they await us at the keep my lady again she found the strangeness of his accent an open question demanding an answer who awaits us she asked the convocation of the faith all those who keep bright the name and the deeds of your holy son javid said jessica glanced around her saw alia smiling at javid asked is this man one of your appointees daughter alia nodded a man destined for great deeds but jessica saw that javid had no pleasure in this attention marked him for gurneys special study and there came gurney with five trusted men signaling that they had the suspicious laggards under interrogation he walked with the rolling stride of a powerful man glance flicking left right all around every muscle flowing through the relaxed alertness she had taught him out of the bene gesserit pranabindu manual he was an ugly lump of trained reflexes a killer and altogether terrifying to some but jessica loved him and prized him above all other living men the scar of an inkvine whip rippled along his jaw giving him a sinister appearance but a smile softened his face as he saw stilgar well done stil he said and they gripped arms in the fremen fashion the lustration javid said touching jessicas arm jessica drew back chose her words carefully in the controlled power of voice her tone and delivery calculated for a precise emotional effect upon javid and zebataleph i returned to dune to see my grandchildren must we take time for this priestly nonsense zebataleph reacted with shock his mouth dropping open eyes alarmed glancing about at those who had heard the eyes marked each listener priestly nonsense what effect would such words have coming from the mother of their messiah javid however confirmed jessicas assessment his mouth hardened then smiled the eyes did not smile nor did they waver to mark the listeners javid already knew each member of this party he had an earshot map of those who would be watched with special care from this point onward only seconds later javid stopped smiling with an abruptness which said he knew how he had betrayed himself javid had not failed to do his homework he knew the observational powers possessed by the lady jessica a short jerking nod of his head acknowledged those powers in a lightning flash of mentation jessica weighed the necessities a subtle hand signal to gurney would bring javids death it could be done here for effect or in quiet later and be made to appear an accident she thought when we try to conceal our innermost drives the entire being screams betrayal bene gesserit training turned upon this revelation raising the adepts above it and teaching them to read the open flesh of others she saw javids intelligence as valuable a temporary weight in the balance if he could be won over he could be the link she needed the line into the arrakeen priesthood and he was alias man jessica said my official party must remain small we have room for one addition however javid you will join us zebataleph i am sorry and javid i will attend this this ceremony if you insist javid allowed himself a deep breath and a lowvoiced as muaddibs mother commands he glanced to alia to zebataleph back to jessica it pains me to delay the reunion with your grandchildren but there are ahhh reasons of state jessica thought good hes a businessman above all else once weve determined the proper coinage well buy him and she found herself enjoying the fact that he insisted on his precious ceremony this little victory would give him power with his fellows and they both knew it accepting his lustration could be a down payment on later services i presume youve arranged transportation she said i give you the desert chameleon whose ability to blend itself into the background tells you all you need to know about the roots of ecology and the foundations of a personal identity book of diatribes from the hayt chronicle leto sat playing a small baliset which had been sent to him on his fifth birthday by that consummate artist of the instrument gurney halleck in four years of practice leto had achieved a certain fluency although the two bass side strings still gave him trouble he had found the baliset soothing however for particular feelings of upset a fact which had not escaped ghanima he sat now in twilight on a rock shelf at the southernmost extremity of the craggy outcropping which sheltered sietch tabr softly he strummed the baliset ghanima stood behind him her small figure radiating protest she had not wanted to come here into the open after learning from stilgar that their grandmother was delayed in arrakeen she particularly objected to coming here with nightfall near attempting to hurry her brother she asked well what is it for an answer he began another tune for the first time since accepting the gift leto felt intensely aware that this baliset had originated with a master craftsman on caladan he possessed inherited memories which could inflict him with profound nostalgia for that beautiful planet where house atreides had ruled leto had but to relax his inner barriers in the presence of this music and he would hear memories from those times when gurney had employed the baliset to beguile his friend and charge paul atreides with the baliset sounding in his own hands leto felt himself more and more dominated by his fathers psychical presence still he played relating more strongly to the instrument with every second that passed he sensed the absolute idealized summation within himself which knew how to play this baliset though nineyearold muscles had not yet been conditioned to that inner awareness ghanima tapped her foot impatiently unaware that she matched the rhythm of her brothers playing setting his mouth in a grimace of concentration leto broke from the familiar music and tried a song more ancient than any even gurney had played it had been old when fremen migrated to their fifth planet the words echoed a zensunni theme and he heard them in his memory while his fingers elicited a faltering version of the tune natures beauteous form contains a lovely essence called by some decay by this lovely presence new life finds its way tears shed silently are but water of the soul they bring new life to the pain of being a separation from that seeing which death makes whole ghanima spoke behind him as he strummed the final note theres a mucky old song why that one because it fits will you play it for gurney perhaps hell call it moody nonsense i know leto peered back over his shoulder at ghanima there was no surprise in him that she knew the song and its lyrics but he felt a sudden onset of awe at the singleness of their twinned lives one of them could die and yet remain alive in the others consciousness every shared memory intact they were that close he found himself frightened by the timeless web of that closeness broke his gaze away from her the web contained gaps he knew his fear arose from the newest of those gaps he felt their lives beginning to separate and wondered how can i tell her of this thing which has happened only to me he peered out over the desert seeing the deep shadows behind the barachans those high crescentshaped migratory dunes which moved like waves around arrakis this was kedem the inner desert and its dunes were rarely marked these days by the irregularities of a giant worms progress sunset drew bloody streaks over the dunes imparting a fiery light to the shadow edges a hawk falling from the crimson sky captured his awareness as it captured a rock partridge in flight directly beneath him on the desert floor plants grew in a profusion of greens watered by a qanat which flowed partly in the open partly in covered tunnels the water came from giant windtrap collectors behind him on the highest point of rock the green flag of the atreides flew openly there water and green the new symbols of arrakis water and green a diamondshaped oasis of planted dunes spread beneath his high perch focusing his attention into sharp fremen awareness the bell call of a nightbird came from the cliff below him and it amplified the sensation that he lived this moment out of a wild past nous avons change tout cela he thought falling easily into one of the ancient tongues which he and ghanima employed in private we have altered all of that he sighed oublier je ne puis i can not forget beyond the oasis he could see in this failing light the land fremen called the emptiness the land where nothing grows the land never fertile water and the great ecological plan were changing that there were places now on arrakis where one could see the plush green velvet of forested hills forests on arrakis some in the new generation found it difficult to imagine dunes beneath those undulant green hills to such young eyes there was no shock value in seeing the flat foliage of rain trees but leto found himself thinking now in the old fremen manner wary of change fearful in the presence of the new he said the children tell me they seldom find sandtrout here near the surface anymore whats that supposed to indicate ghanima asked there was petulance in her tone things are beginning to change very swiftly he said again the bird chimed in the cliff and night fell upon the desert as the hawk had fallen upon the partridge night often subjected him to an assault of memories all of those inner lives clamoring for their moment ghanima didnt object to this phenomenon in quite the way he did she knew his disquiet though and he felt her hand touch his shoulder in sympathy he struck an angry chord from the baliset how could he tell her what was happening to him within his head were wars uncounted lives parceling out their ancient memories violent accidents loves languor the colors of many places and many faces the buried sorrows and leaping joys of multitudes he heard elegies to springs on planets which no longer existed green dances and firelight wails and halloos a harvest of conversations without number their assault was hardest to bear at nightfall in the open shouldnt we be going in she asked he shook his head and she felt the movement realizing at last that his troubles went deeper than she had suspected why do i so often greet the night out here he asked himself he did not feel ghanima withdraw her hand you know why you torment yourself this way she said he heard the gentle chiding in her voice yes he knew the answer lay there in his awareness obvious because that great knownunknown within moves me like a wave he felt the cresting of his past as though he rode a surfboard he had his fathers timespread memories of prescience superimposed upon everything else yet he wanted all of those pasts he wanted them and they were so very dangerous he knew that completely now with this new thing which he would have to tell ghanima the desert was beginning to glow under the rising light of first moon he stared out at the false immobility of sand furls reaching into infinity to his left in the near distance lay the attendant a rock outcropping which sandblast winds had reduced to a low sinuous shape like a dark worm striking through the dunes someday the rock beneath him would be cut down to such a shape and sietch tabr would be no more except in the memories of someone like himself he did not doubt that there would be someone like himself whyre you staring at the attendant ghanima asked he shrugged in defiance of their guardians orders he and ghanima often went to the attendant they had discovered a secret hiding place there and leto knew now why that place lured them beneath him its distance foreshortened by darkness an open stretch of qanat gleamed in moonlight its surface rippled with movements of predator fish which fremen always planted in their stored water to keep out the sandtrout i stand between fish and worm he murmured what he repeated it louder she put a hand to her mouth beginning to suspect the thing which moved him her father had acted thus she had but to peer inward and compare leto shuddered memories which fastened him to places his flesh had never known presented him with answers to questions he had not asked he saw relationships and unfolding events against a gigantic inner screen the sandworm of dune would not cross water water poisoned it yet water had been known here in prehistoric times white gypsum pans attested to bygone lakes and seas wells deepdrilled found water which sandtrout sealed off as clearly as if hed witnessed the events he saw what had happened on this planet and it filled him with foreboding for the cataclysmic changes which human intervention was bringing his voice barely above a whisper he said i know what happened ghanima she bent close to him yes the sandtrout he fell silent and she wondered why he kept referring to the haploid phase of the planets giant sandworm but she dared not prod him the sandtrout he repeated was introduced here from some other place this was a wet planet then they proliferated beyond the capability of existing ecosystems to deal with them sandtrout encysted the available free water made this a desert planet and they did it to survive in a planet sufficiently dry they could move to their sandworm phase the sandtrout she shook her head not doubting him but unwilling to search those depths where he gathered such information and she thought sandtrout many times in this flesh and other had she played the childhood game poling for sandtrout teasing them into a thin glove membrane before taking them to the deathstill for their water it was difficult to think of this mindless little creature as a shaper of enormous events leto nodded to himself fremen had always known to plant predator fish in their water cisterns the haploid sandtrout actively resisted great accumulations of water near the planets surface predators swam in that qanat below him their sandworm vector could handle small amounts of water the amounts held in cellular bondage by human flesh for example but confronted by large bodies of water their chemical factories went wild exploded in the deathtransformation which produced the dangerous melange concentrate the ultimate awareness drug employed in a diluted fraction for the sietch orgy that pure concentrate had taken paul muaddib through the walls of time deep into the well of dissolution which no other male had ever dared ghanima sensed her brother trembling where he sat in front of her what have you done she demanded but he would not leave his own train of revelation fewer sandtrout the ecological transformation of the planet they resist it of course she said and now she began to understand the fear in his voice drawn into this thing against her will when the sandtrout go so do all the worms he said the tribes must be warned no more spice she said words merely touched high points of the system danger which they both saw hanging over human intrusion into dunes ancient relationships its the thing alia knows he said its why she gloats how can you be sure of that im sure now she knew for certain what disturbed him and she felt the knowledge chill her the tribes wont believe us if she denies it he said his statement went to the primary problem of their existence what fremen expected wisdom from a nineyearold alia growing farther and farther from her own inner sharing each day played upon this we must convince stilgar ghanima said as one their heads turned and they stared out over the moonlit desert it was a different place now changed by just a few moments of awareness human interplay with that environment had never been more apparent to them they felt themselves as integral parts of a dynamic system held in delicately balanced order the new outlook involved a real change of consciousness which flooded them with observations as lietkynes had said the universe was a place of constant conversation between animal populations the haploid sandtrout had spoken to them as human animals the tribes would understand a threat to water leto said but its a threat to more than water its a she fell silent understanding the deeper meaning of his words water was the ultimate power symbol on arrakis at their roots fremen remained specialapplication animals desert survivors governance experts under conditions of stress and as water became plentiful a strange symbol transfer came over them even while they understood the old necessities you mean a threat to power she corrected him of course but will they believe us if they see it happening if they see the imbalance balance she said and repeated her fathers words from long ago its what distinguishes a people from a mob her words called up their father in him and he said economics versus beauty a story older than sheba he sighed looked over his shoulder at her im beginning to have prescient dreams ghani a sharp gasp escaped her he said when stilgar told us our grandmother was delayed i already knew that moment now my other dreams are suspect leto she shook her head eyes damp it came later for our father dont you think it might be ive dreamed myself enclosed in armor and racing across the dunes he said and ive been to jacurutu jacu she cleared her throat that old myth a real place ghani i must find this man they call the preacher i must find him and question him you think hes our father ask yourself that question itd be just like him she agreed but i dont like the things i know ill do he said for the first time in my life i understand my father she felt excluded from his thoughts said the preachers probably just an old mystic i pray for that he whispered oh how i pray for that he rocked forward got to his feet the baliset hummed in his hand as he moved would that he were only gabriel without a horn he stared silently at the moonlit desert she turned to look where he looked saw the foxfire glow of rotting vegetation at the edge of the sietch plantings then the clean blending into lines of dunes that was a living place out there even when the desert slept something remained awake in it she sensed that wakefulness hearing animals below her drinking at the qanat letos revelation had transformed the night this was a living moment a time to discover regularities within perpetual change an instant in which to feel that long movement from their terranic past all of it encapsulated in her memories why jacurutu she asked and the flatness of her tone shattered the mood why i dont know when stilgar first told us how they killed the people there and made the place tabu i thought what you thought but danger comes from there now and the preacher she didnt respond didnt demand that he share more of his prescient dreams with her and she knew how much this told him of her terror that way led to abomination and they both knew it the word hung unspoken between them as he turned and led the way back over the rocks to the sietch entrance abomination the universe is gods it is one thing a wholeness against which all separations may be identified transient life even that selfaware and reasoning life which we call sentient holds only fragile trusteeship on any portion of the wholeness commentaries from the cet commission of ecumenical translators halleck used hand signals to convey the actual message while speaking aloud of other matters he didnt like the small anteroom the priests had assigned for this report knowing it would be crawling with spy devices let them try to break the tiny hand signals though the atreides had used this means of communication for centuries without anyone the wiser night had fallen outside but the room had no windows depending upon glowglobes at the upper corners many of those we took were alias people halleck signaled watching jessicas face as he spoke aloud telling her the interrogation still continued it was as you anticipated then jessica replied her fingers winking she nodded and spoke an open reply ill expect a full report when youre satisfied gurney of course my lady he said and his fingers continued there is another thing quite disturbing under the deep drugs some of our captives talked of jacurutu and as they spoke the name they died a conditioned heartstopper jessicas fingers asked and she said have you released any of the captives a few my lady the more obvious culls and his fingers darted we suspect a heartcompulsion but are not yet certain the autopsies arent completed i thought you should know about this thing of jacurutu however and came immediately my duke and i always thought jacurutu an interesting legend probably based on fact jessicas fingers said and she ignored the usual tug of sorrow as she spoke of her longdead love do you have orders halleck asked speaking aloud jessica answered in kind telling him to return to the landing field and report when he had positive information but her fingers conveyed another message resume contact with your friends among the smugglers if jacurutu exists theyll support themselves by selling spice thered be no other market for them except the smugglers halleck bowed his head briefly while his fingers said ive already set this course in motion my lady and because he could not ignore the training of a lifetime added be very careful in this place alia is your enemy and most of the priesthood belongs to her not javid jessicas fingers responded he hates the atreides i doubt anyone but an adept could detect it but im positive of it he conspires and alia doesnt know of it im assigning additional guards to your person halleck said speaking aloud avoiding the light spark of displeasure which jessicas eyes betrayed there are dangers im certain will you spend the night here well go later to sietch tabr she said and hesitated on the point of telling him not to send more guards but she held her silence gurneys instincts were to be trusted more than one atreides had learned this both to his pleasure and his sorrow i have one more meeting with the master of novitiates this time she said thats the last one and ill be happily shut of this place and i beheld another beast coming up out of the sand and he had two horns like a lamb but his mouth was fanged and fiery as the dragon and his body shimmered and burned with great heat while it did hiss like the serpent revised orange catholic bible he called himself the preacher and there had come to be an awesome fear among many on arrakis that he might be muaddib returned from the desert not dead at all muaddib could be alive for who had seen his body for that matter who saw any body that the desert took but still muaddib points of comparison could be made although no one from the old days came forward and said yes i see that this is muaddib i know him still like muaddib the preacher was blind his eye sockets black and scarred in a way that could have been done by a stone burner and his voice conveyed that crackling penetration that same compelling force which demanded a response from deep within you many remarked this he was lean this preacher his leathery face seamed his hair grizzled but the deep desert did that to many people you had only to look about you and see this proven and there was another fact for contention the preacher was led by a young fremen a lad without known sietch who said when questioned that he worked for hire it was argued that muaddib knowing the future had not needed such a guide except at the very end when his grief overcame him but hed needed a guide then everyone knew it the preacher had appeared one winter morning in the streets of arrakeen a brown and ridgeveined hand on the shoulder of his young guide the lad who gave his name as assan tariq moved through the flintsmelling dust of the early swarming leading his charge with the practiced agility of the warrenborn never once losing contact it was observed that the blind man wore a traditional bourka over a stillsuit which bore the mark about it of those once made only in the sietch caves of the deepest desert it wasnt like the shabby suits being turned out these days the nose tube which captured moisture from his breath for the recycling layers beneath the bourka was wrapped in braid and it was the black vine braid so seldom seen anymore the suits mask across the lower half of his face carried green patches etched by the blown sand all in all this preacher was a figure from dunes past many among the early crowds of that winter day had noted his passage after all a blind fremen remained a rarity fremen law still consigned the blind to shaihulud the wording of the law although it was less honored in these modem watersoft times remained unchanged from the earliest days the blind were a gift to shaihulud they were to be exposed in the open bled for the great worms to devour when it was done and there were stories which got back to the cities it was always done out where the largest worms still ruled those called old men of the desert a blind fremen then was a curiosity and people paused to watch the passing of this odd pair the lad appeared about fourteen standard one of the new breed who wore modified stillsuits it left the face open to the moisturerobbing air he had slender features the allblue spicetinted eyes a nubbin nose and that innocuous look of innocence which so often masks cynical knowledge in the young in contrast the blind man was a reminder of times almost forgotten long in stride and with a wiriness that spoke of many years on the sand with only his feet or a captive worm to carry him he held his head in that stiffnecked rigidity which some of the blind can not put off the hooded head moved only when he cocked an ear at an interesting sound through the days gathering crowds the strange pair came arriving at last on the steps which led up like terraced hectares to the escarpment which was alias temple a fitting companion to pauls keep up the steps the preacher went until he and his young guide came to the third landing where pilgrims of the hajj awaited the morning opening of those gigantic doors above them they were doors large enough to have admitted an entire cathedral from one of the ancient religions passing through them was said to reduce a pilgrims soul to motedom sufficiently small that it could pass through the eye of a needle and enter heaven at the edge of the third landing the preacher turned and it was as though he looked about him seeing with his empty eye sockets the foppish city dwellers some of them fremen with garments which simulated stillsuits but were only decorative fabrics seeing the eager pilgrims fresh off the guild space transports and awaiting that first step on the devotion which would ensure them a place in paradise the landing was a noisy place there were mahdi spirit cultists in green robes and carrying live hawks trained to screech a call to heaven food was being sold by shouting vendors many things were being offered for sale the voices shouting in competitive stridence there was the dune tarot with its booklets of commentaries imprinted on shigawire one vendor had exotic bits of cloth guaranteed to have been touched by muaddib himself another had vials of water certified to have come from sietch tabr where muaddib lived through it all there were conversations in a hundred or more dialects of galach interspersed with harsh gutturals and squeaks of outrine languages which were gathered under the holy imperium face dancers and little people from the suspected artisan planets of the tleilaxu bounced and gyrated through the throng in bright clothing there were lean faces and fat waterrich faces the susurration of nervous feet came from the gritty plasteel which formed the wide steps and occasionally a keening voice would rise out of the cacophony in prayer muaaaaddib muaaaaddib greet my souls entreaty you who are gods anointed greet my soul muaaaaddib nearby among the pilgrims two mummers played for a few coins reciting the lines of the currently popular disputation of armistead and leandgrah the preacher cocked his head to listen the mummers were middleaged city men with bored voices at a word of command the young guide described them for the preacher they were garbed in loose robes not even deigning to simulate stillsuits on their waterrich bodies assan tariq thought this amusing but the preacher reprimanded him the mummer who played the part of leandgrah was just concluding his oration bah the universe can be grasped only by the sentient hand that hand is what drives your precious brain and it drives everything else that derives from the brain you see what you have created you become sentient only after the hand has done its work a scattering of applause greeted his performance the preacher sniffed and his nostrils recorded the rich odors of this place uncapped esters of poorly adjusted stillsuits masking musks of diverse origin the common flinty dust exhalations of uncounted exotic diets and the aromas of rare incense which already had been ignited within alias temple and now drifted down over the steps in cleverly directed currents the preachers thoughts were mirrored on his face as he absorbed his surroundings we have come to this we fremen a sudden diversion rippled through the crowd on the landing sand dancers had come into the plaza at the foot of the steps half a hundred of them tethered to each other by elacca ropes they obviously had been dancing thus for days seeking a state of ecstasy foam dribbled from their mouths as they jerked and stamped to their secret music a full third of them dangled unconscious from the ropes tugged back and forth by the others like dolls on strings one of these dolls had come awake though and the crowd apparently knew what to expect i have seeeeeen the newly awakened dancer shrieked i have seeeeeen he resisted the pull of the other dancers darted his wild gaze right and left where this city is there will be only sand i have seeeeeen a great swelling laugh went up from the onlookers even the new pilgrims joined it this was too much for the preacher he raised both arms and roared in a voice which surely had commanded worm riders silence the entire throng in the plaza went still at that battle cry the preacher pointed a thin hand toward the dancers and the illusion that he actually saw them was uncanny did you not hear that man blasphemers and idolaters all of you the religion of muaddib is not muaddib he spurns it as he spurns you sand will cover this place sand will cover you saying this he dropped his arms put a hand on his young guides shoulder and commanded take me from this place perhaps it was the preachers choice of words he spurns it as he spurns you perhaps it was his tone certainly something more than human a vocality trained surely in the arts of the bene gesserit voice which commanded by mere nuances of subtle inflection perhaps it was only the inherent mysticism of this place where muaddib had lived and walked and ruled someone called out from the landing shouting at the preachers receding back in a voice which trembled with religious awe is that muaddib come back to us the preacher stopped reached into the purse beneath his bourka and removed an object which only those nearby recognized it was a desertmummified human hand one of the planets jokes on mortality which occasionally turned up in the sand and were universally regarded as communications from shaihulud the hand had been desiccated into a tight fist which ended in white bone scarred by sandblast winds i bring the hand of god and that is all i bring the preacher shouted i speak for the hand of god i am the preacher some took him to mean that the hand was muaddibs but others fastened on that commanding presence and the terrible voice and that was how arrakis came to know his name but it was not the last time his voice was heard it is commonly reported my dear georad that there exists great natural virtue in the melange experience perhaps this is true there remain within me however profound doubts that every use of melange always brings virtue me seems that certain persons have corrupted the use of melange in defiance of god in the words of the ecumenon they have disfigured the soul they skim the surface of melange and believe thereby to attain grace they deride their fellows do great harm to godliness and they distort the meaning of this abundant gift maliciously surely a mutilation beyond the power of man to restore to be truly at one with the virtue of the spice uncorrupted in all ways full of goodly honor a man must permit his deeds and his words to agree when your actions describe a system of evil consequences you should be judged by those consequences and not by your explanations it is thus that we should judge muaddib the pedant heresy it was a small room tinged with the odor of ozone and reduced to a shadowy greyness by dimmed glowglobes and the metallic blue light of a single transeyemonitoring screen the screen was about a meter wide and only twothirds of a meter in height it revealed in remote detail a barren rocky valley with two laza tigers feeding on the bloody remnants of a recent kill on the hillside above the tigers could be seen a slender man in sardaukar working uniform levenbrech insignia at his collar he wore a servocontrol keyboard against his chest one veriform suspensor chair faced the screen occupied by a fairhaired woman of indeterminate age she had a heartshaped face and slender hands which gripped the chair arms as she watched the fullness of a white robe trimmed in gold concealed her figure a pace to her right stood a blocky man dressed in the bronze and gold uniform of a bashar aide in the old imperial sardaukar his greying hair had been closely cropped over square emotionless features the woman coughed said it went as you predicted tyekanik assuredly princess the bashar aide said his voice hoarse she smiled at the tension in his voice asked tell me tyekanik how will my son like the sound of emperor faradn i the title suits him princess that was not my question he might not approve some of the things done to gain him that ahh title then again she turned peered up through the gloom at him you served my father well it was not your fault that he lost the throne to the atreides but surely the sting of that loss must be felt as keenly by you as by any does the princess wensicia have some special task for me tyekanik asked his voice remained hoarse but there was a sharp edge to it now you have a bad habit of interrupting me she said now he smiled displaying thick teeth which glistened in the light from the screen at times you remind me of your father he said always these circumlocutions before a request for a delicate ahh assignment she jerked her gaze away from him to conceal anger asked do you really think those lazas will put my son on the throne its distinctly possible princess you must admit that the bastard get of paul atreides would be no more than juicy morsels for those two and with those twins gone he shrugged the grandson of shaddam iv becomes the logical successor she said that is if we can remove the objections of the fremen the landsraad and choam not to mention any surviving atreides who might javid assures me that his people can take care of alia quite easily i do not count the lady jessica as an atreides who else remains landsraad and choam will go where the profit goes she said but what of the fremen well drown them in their muaddibs religion easier said than done my dear tyekanik i see he said were back to that old argument house corrino has done worse things to gain power she said but to embrace this this mahdis religion my son respects you she said princess i long for the day when house corrino returns to its rightful seat of power so does every remaining sardaukar here on salusa but if you tyekanik this is the planet salusa secundus do not fall into the lazy ways which spread through our imperium full name complete title attention to every detail those attributes will send the atreides lifeblood into the sands of arrakis every detail tyekanik he knew what she was doing with this attack it was part of the shifty trickiness shed learned from her sister irulan but he felt himself losing ground do you hear me tyekanik i hear princess i want you to embrace this muaddib religion she said princess i would walk into fire for you but this that is an order tyekanik he swallowed stared into the screen the laza tigers had finished feeding and now lay on the sand completing their toilet long tongues moving across their forepaws an order tyekanik do you understand me i hear and obey princess his voice did not change tone she sighed ohh if my father were only alive yes princess dont mock me tyekanik i know how distasteful this is to you but if you set the example he may not follow princess hell follow she pointed at the screen it occurs to me that the levenbrech out there could be a problem a problem how is that how many people know this thing of the tigers that levenbrech who is their trainer one transport pilot you and of course he tapped his own chest what about the buyers they know nothing what is it you fear princess my son is well sensitive sardaukar do not reveal secrets he said neither do dead men she reached forward and depressed a red key beneath the lighted screen immediately the laza tigers raised their heads they got to their feet and looked up the hill at the levenbrech moving as one they turned and began a scrambling run up the hillside appearing calm at first the levenbrech depressed a key on his console his movements were assured but as the cats continued their dash toward him he became more frenzied pressing the key harder and harder a look of startled awareness came over his features and his hand jerked toward the working knife at his waist the movement came too late a raking claw hit his chest and sent him sprawling as he fell the other tiger took his neck in one greatfanged bite and shook him his spine snapped attention to detail the princess said she turned stiffened as tyekanik drew his knife but he presented the blade to her handle foremost perhaps youd like to use my knife to attend to another detail he said put that back in its sheath and dont act the fool she raged sometimes tyekanik you try me to the that was a good man out there princess one of my best one of my best she corrected him he drew a deep trembling breath sheathed his knife and what of my transport pilot this will be ascribed to an accident she said you will advise him to employ the utmost caution when he brings those tigers back to us and of course when he has delivered our pets to javids people on the transport she looked at his knife is that an order princess it is shall i then fall on my knife or will you take care of that ahhh detail she spoke with a false calm her voice heavy tyekanik were i not absolutely convinced that you would fall on your knife at my command you would not be standing here beside me armed he swallowed stared at the screen the tigers once more were feeding she refused to look at the scene continued to stare at tyekanik as she said you will as well tell our buyers not to bring us any more matched pairs of children who fit the necessary description as you command princess dont use that tone with me tyekanik yes princess her lips drew into a straight line then how many more of those paired costumes do we have six sets of the robes complete with stillsuits and the sand shoes all with the atreides insignia worked into them fabrics as rich as the ones on that pair she nodded toward the screen fit for royalty princess attention to detail she said the garments will be dispatched to arrakis as gifts for our royal cousins they will be gifts from my son do you understand me tyekanik completely princess have him inscribe a suitable note it should say that he sends these few paltry garments as tokens of his devotion to house atreides something on that order and the occasion there must be a birthday or holy day or something tyekanik i leave that to you i trust you my friend he stared at her silently her face hardened surely you must know that who else can i trust since the death of my husband he shrugged thinking how closely she emulated the spider it would not do to get on intimate terms with her as he now suspected his levenbrech had done and tyekanik she said one more detail yes princess my son is being trained to rule there will come a time when he must grasp the sword in his own hands you will know when that moment arrives ill wish to be informed immediately as you command princess she leaned back peered knowingly at tyekanik you do not approve of me i know that it is unimportant to me as long as you remember the lesson of the levenbrech he was very good with animals but disposable yes princess that is not what i mean it isnt then i dont understand an army she said is composed of disposable completely replaceable parts that is the lesson of the levenbrech replaceable parts he said including the supreme command without the supreme command there is seldom a reason for an army tyekanik that is why you will immediately embrace this mahdi religion and at the same time begin the campaign to convert my son at once princess i presume you dont want me to stint his education in the other martial arts at the expense of this ahh religion she pushed herself out of the chair strode around him paused at the door and spoke without looking back someday you will try my patience once too often tyekanik with that she let herself out either we abandon the longhonored theory of relativity or we cease to believe that we can engage in continued accurate prediction of the future indeed knowing the future raises a host of questions which can not be answered under conventional assumptions unless one first projects an observer outside of time and second nullifies all movement if you accept the theory of relativity it can be shown that time and the observer must stand still in relationship to each or inaccuracies will intervene this would seem to say that it is impossible to engage in accurate prediction of the future how then do we explain the continued seeking after this visionary goal by respected scientists how then do we explain muaddib lectures on prescience by harq alada i must tell you something jessica said even though i know my telling will remind you of many experiences from our mutual past and that this will place you in jeopardy she paused to see how ghanima was taking this they sat alone just the two of them occupying low cushions in a chamber of sietch tabr it had required considerable skill to maneuver this meeting and jessica was not at all certain that she had been alone in the maneuvering ghanima had seemed to anticipate and augment every step it was almost two hours after daylight and the excitements of greeting and all of the recognitions were past jessica forced her pulse back to a steady pace and focused her attention into this rockwalled room with its dark hangings and yellow cushions to meet the accumulated tensions she found herself for the first time in years recalling the litany against fear from the bene gesserit rite i must not fear fear is the mindkiller fear is the littledeath that brings total obliteration i will face my fear i will permit it to pass over me and through me and when it has gone past i will turn the inner eye to see its path where the fear has gone there will be nothing only i will remain she did this silently and took a deep calming breath it helps at times ghanima said the litany i mean jessica closed her eyes to hide the shock of this insight it had been a long time since anyone had been able to read her that intimately the realization was disconcerting especially when it was ignited by an intellect which hid behind a mask of childhood having faced her fear though jessica opened her eyes and knew the source of turmoil i fear for my grandchildren neither of these children betrayed the stigmata of abomination which alia flaunted although leto showed every sign of some terrifying concealment it was for that reason hed been deftly excluded from this meeting on impulse jessica put aside her ingrained emotional masks knowing them to be of little use here barriers to communication not since those loving moments with her duke had she lowered these barriers and she found the action both relief and pain there remained facts which no curse or prayer or litany could wash from existence flight would not leave such facts behind they could not be ignored elements of pauls vision had been rearranged and the times had caught up with his children they were a magnet in the void evil and all the sad misuses of power collected around them ghanima watching the play of emotions across her grandmothers face marveled that jessica had let down her controls with catching movements of their heads remarkably synchronized both turned eyes met and they stared deeply probingly at each other thoughts without spoken words passed between them jessica i wish you to see my fear ghanima now i know you love me it was a swift moment of utter trust jessica said when your father was but a boy i brought a reverend mother to caladan to test him ghanima nodded the memory of it was extremely vivid we bene gesserits were already cautious to make sure that the children we raised were human and not animal one can not always tell by exterior appearances its the way you were trained ghanima said and the memory flooded into her mind that old bene gesserit gaius helen mohiam shed come to castle caladan with her poisoned gom jabbar and her box of burning pain pauls hand ghanimas own hand in the shared memory screamed with the agony of that box while the old woman talked calmly of immediate death if the hand were withdrawn from the pain and there had been no doubt of the death in that needle held ready against the childs neck while the aged voice droned its rationale youve heard of animals chewing off a leg to escape a trap theres an animal kind of trick a human would remain in the trap endure the pain feigning death that he might kill the trapper and remove a threat to his kind ghanima shook her head against the remembered pain the burning the burning paul had imagined his skin curling black on that agonized hand within the box flesh crisping and dropping away until only charred bones remained and it had been a trick the hand unharmed but sweat stood out on ghanimas forehead at the memory of course you remember this in a way that i can not jessica said for a moment memorydriven ghanima saw her grandmother in a different light what this woman might do out of the driving necessities of that early conditioning in the bene gesserit schools it raised new questions about jessicas return to arrakis it would be stupid to repeat such a test on you or your brother jessica said you already know the way it went i must assume you are human that you will not misuse your inherited powers but you dont make that assumption at all ghanima said jessica blinked realized that the barriers had been creeping back in place dropped them once more she asked will you believe my love for you yes ghanima raised a hand as jessica started to speak but that love wouldnt stop you from destroying us oh i know the reasoning better the animalhuman die than it recreate itself and thats especially true if the animalhuman bears the name atreides you at least are human jessica blurted i trust my instinct on this ghanima saw the truth in this said but youre not sure of leto im not abomination jessica could only nod ghanima said not yet at least we both know the danger of it though we can see the way of it in alia jessica cupped her hands over her eyes thought even love cant protect us from unwanted facts and she knew then that she still loved her daughter crying out silently against fate alia oh alia i am sorry for my part in your destruction ghanima cleared her throat loudly jessica lowered her hands thought i may mourn my poor daughter but there are other necessities now she said so youve recognized what happened to alia leto and i watched it happen we were powerless to prevent it although we discussed many possibilities youre sure that your brother is free of this curse im sure the quiet assurance in that statement could not be denied jessica found herself accepting it then how is it youve escaped ghanima explained the theory upon which she and leto had settled that their avoiding of the spice trance while alia entered it often made the difference she went on to reveal his dreams and the plans theyd discussed even jacurutu jessica nodded alia is an atreides though and that poses enormous problems ghanima fell silent before the sudden realization that jessica still mourned her duke as though his death had been but yesterday that she would guard his name and memory against all threats personal memories from the dukes own lifetime fled through ghanimas awareness to reinforce this assessment to soften it with understanding now jessica said voice brisk what about this preacher i heard some disquieting reports yesterday after that damnable lustration ghanima shrugged he could be paul yes but we havent seen him to examine javid laughs at the rumors jessica said ghanima hesitated then do you trust this javid a grim smile touched jessicas lips no more than you do leto says javid laughs at the wrong things ghanima said so much for javids laughter jessica said but do you actually entertain the notion that my son is still alive that he has returned in this guise we say its possible and leto ghanima found her mouth suddenly dry remembered fears clutching her breast she forced herself to overcome them recounted letos other revelations of prescient dreams jessica moved her head from side to side as though wounded ghanima said leto says he must find this preacher and make sure yes of course i should never have left here it was cowardly of me why do you blame yourself you had reached a limit i know that leto knows it even alia may know it jessica put a hand to her own throat rubbed it briefly then yes the problem of alia she works a strange attraction on leto ghanima said thats why i helped you meet alone with me he agrees that she is beyond hope but still he finds ways to be with her and study her and its very disturbing when i try to talk against this he falls asleep he is she drugging him nooo ghanima shook her head but he has this odd empathy for her and in his sleep he often mutters jacurutu that again and jessica found herself recounting gurneys report about the conspirators exposed at the landing field i sometimes fear alia wants leto to seek out jacurutu ghanima said and i always thought it only a legend you know it of course jessica shuddered terrible story terrible what must we do ghanima asked i fear to search all of my memories all of my lives ghani i warn you against that you mustnt risk it may happen even if i dont risk it how do we know what really happened to alia no you could be spared that that possession she ground the word out well jacurutu is it ive sent gurney to find the place if it exists but how can he oh of course the smugglers jessica found herself silenced by this further example of how ghanimas mind worked in concert with what must be an inner awareness of others of me how truly strange it was jessica thought that this young flesh could carry all of pauls memories at least until the moment of pauls spermal separation from his own past it was an invasion of privacy against which something primal in jessica rebelled momentarily she felt herself sinking into the absolute and unswerving bene gesserit judgment abomination but there was a sweetness about this child a willingness to sacrifice for her brother which could not be denied we are one life reaching out into a dark future jessica thought we are one blood and she girded herself to accept the events which she and gurney halleck had set in motion leto must be separated from his sister must be trained as the sisterhood insisted i hear the wind blowing across the desert and i see the moons of a winter night rising tike great ships in the void to them i make my vow i will be resolute and make an art of government i will balance my inherited past and become a perfect storehouse of my relic memories and i will be known for kindliness more than for knowledge my face will shine down the corridors of time for as long as humans exist letos vow after harq alada when she had been quite young alia atreides had practiced for hours in the pranabindu trance trying to strengthen her own private personality against the onslaught of all those others she knew the problem melange could not be escaped in a sietch warren it infested everything food water air even the fabrics against which she cried at night very early she recognized the uses of the sietch orgy where the tribe drank the deathwater of a worm in the orgy fremen released the accumulated pressures of their own genetic memories and they denied those memories she saw her companions being temporarily possessed in the orgy for her there was no such release no denial she had possessed full consciousness long before birth with that consciousness came a cataclysmic awareness of her circumstances womblocked into intense inescapable contact with the personas of all her ancestors and of those identities deathtransmitted in spicetau to the lady jessica before birth alia had contained every bit of the knowledge required in a bene gesserit reverend mother plus much much more from all those others in that knowledge lay recognition of a terrible reality abomination the totality of that knowledge weakened her the preborn did not escape still shed fought against the more terrifying of her ancestors winning for a time a pyrrhic victory which had lasted through childhood shed known a private personality but it had no immunity against casual intrusions from those who lived their reflected lives through her thus will i be one day she thought this thought chilled her to walk and dissemble through the life of a child from her own loins intruding grasping at consciousness to add a quantum of experience fear stalked her childhood it persisted into puberty she had fought it never asking for help who would understand the help she required not her mother who could never quite drive away that specter of bene gesserit judgment the preborn were abomination there had come that night when her brother walked alone into the desert seeking death giving himself to shaihulud as blind fremen were supposed to do within the month alia had been married to pauls swordmaster duncan idaho a mentat brought back from the dead by the arts of the tleilaxu her mother fled back to caladan pauls twins were alias legal charge and she controlled the regency pressures of responsibility had driven the old fears away and she had been wide open to the inner lives demanding their advice plunging into spice trance in search of guiding visions the crisis came on a day like many others in the spring month of laab a clear morning at muaddibs keep with a cold wind blowing down from the pole alia still wore the yellow for mourning the color of the sterile sun more and more these past few weeks shed been denying the inner voice of her mother who tended to sneer at preparation for the coming holy days to be centered on the temple the innerawareness of jessica faded faded sinking away at last with a faceless demand that alia would be better occupied working on the atreides law new lives began to clamor for their moment of consciousness alia felt that she had opened a bottomless pit and faces arose out of it like a swarm of locusts until she came at last to focus on one who was like a beast the old baron harkonnen in terrified outrage she had screamed out against all of that inner clamor winning a temporary silence on this morning alia took her prebreakfast walk through the keeps roof garden in a new attempt to win the inner battle she tried to hold her entire awareness within chodas admonition to the zensunni leaving the ladder one may fall upward but mornings glow along the cliffs of the shield wall kept distracting her plantings of resilient fuzzgrass filled the gardens pathways when she looked away from the shield wall she saw dew on the grass the catch of all the moisture which had passed here in the night it reflected her own passage as of a multitude that multitude made her giddy each reflection carried the imprint of a face from the inner multitude she tried to focus her mind on what the grass implied the presence of plentiful dew told her how far the ecological transformation had progressed on arrakis the climate of these northern latitudes was growing warmer atmospheric carbon dioxide was on the increase she reminded herself how many new hectares would be put under green plants in the coming year and it required thirtyseven thousand cubic feet of water to irrigate just one hectare despite every attempt at mundane thoughts she could not drive away the sharklike circling of all those others within her she put her hands to her forehead and pressed her temple guards had brought her a prisoner to judge at sunset the previous day one essas paymon a dark little man ostensibly in the pay of a house minor the nebiros who traded in holy artifacts and small manufactured items for decoration actually paymon was known to be a choam spy whose task was to assess the yearly spice crop alia had been on the point of sending him into the dungeons when hed protested loudly the injustice of the atreides that could have brought him an immediate sentence of death on the hanging tripod but alia had been caught by his boldness shed spoken sternly from her throne of judgment trying to frighten him into revealing more than hed already told her inquisitors why are our spice crops of such interest to the combine honnete she demanded tell us and we may spare you i only collect something for which there is a market paymon said i know nothing of what is done with my harvest and for this petty profit you interfere with our royal plans alia demanded royalty never considers that we might have plans too he countered alia captivated by his desperate audacity said essas paymon will you work for me at this a grin whitened his dark face and he said you were about to obliterate me without a qualm what is my new value that you should suddenly make a market for it youve a simple and practical value she said youre bold and youre for hire to the highest bidder i can bid higher than any other in the empire at which he named a remarkable sum which he required for his services but alia laughed and countered with a figure she considered more reasonable and undoubtedly far more than hed ever before received she added and of course i throw in the gift of your life upon which i presume you place an even more inordinate value a bargain paymon cried and at a signal from alia was led away by her priestly master of appointments ziarenko javid less than an hour later as alia prepared to leave the judgment hall javid came hurrying to report that paymon had been overheard to mutter the fateful lines from the orange catholic bible maleficos non patieris vivere thou shall not suffer a witch to live alia translated so that was his gratitude he was one of those who plotted against her very life in a flush of rage such as shed never before experienced she ordered pay mens immediate execution sending his body to the temple deathstill where his water at least would be of some value in the priestly coffers and all night long paymons dark face haunted her she tried all of her tricks against this persistent accusing image reciting the bu ji from the fremen book of kreos nothing occurs nothing occurs but paymon took her through a wearing night into this giddy new day where she could see that his face had joined those in the jeweled reflections from the dew a female guard called her to breakfast from the roof door behind a low hedge of mimosa alia sighed she felt small choice between hells the outcry within her mind or the outcry from her attendants all were pointless voices but persistent in their demands hourglass noises that she would like to silence with the edge of a knife ignoring the guard alia stared across the roof garden toward the shield wall a bahada had left its broad outwash like a detrital fan upon the sheltered floor of her domain the delta of sand spread out before her gaze outlined by the morning sun it came to her that an uninitiated eye might see that broad fan as evidence of a rivers flow but it was no more than the place where her brother had shattered the shield wall with the atreides family atomics opening a path from the desert for the sandworms which had carried his fremen troops to shocking victory over his imperial predecessor shaddam iv now a broad qanat flowed with water on the shield walls far side to block off sandworm intrusions sandworms would not cross open water it poisoned them would that i had such a barrier within my mind she thought the thought increased her giddy sensation of being separated from reality sandworms sandworms her memory presented a collection of sandworm images mighty shaihulud the demiurge of the fremen deadly beast of the deserts depths whose outpourings included the priceless spice how odd it was this sandworm to grow from a flat and leathery sandtrout she thought they were like the flocking multitude within her awareness the sandtrout when linked edge to edge against the planets bedrock formed living cisterns they held back the water that their sandworm vector might live alia could feel the analogy some of those others within her mind held back dangerous forces which could destroy her again the guard called her to breakfast a note of impatience apparent angrily alia turned waved a dismissal signal the guard obeyed but the roof door slammed at the sound of the slamming door alia felt herself caught by everything she had attempted to deny the other lives welled up within her like a hideous tide each demanding life pressed its face against her vision centers a cloud of faces some presented mangespotted skin other were callous and full of sooty shadows there were mouths like moist lozenges the pressure of the swarm washed over her in a current which demanded that she float free and plunge into them no she whispered no no no she would have collapsed onto the path but for a bench beside her which accepted her sagging body she tried to sit could not stretched out on the cold plasteel still whispering denial the tide continued to rise within her she felt attuned to the slightest show of attention aware of the risk but alert for every exclamation from those guarded mouths which clamored within her they were a cacophony of demand for her attention me me no me and she knew that if she once gave her attention gave it completely she would be lost to behold one face out of the multitude and follow the voice of that face would be to be held by the egocentrism which shared her existence prescience does this to you a voice whispered she covered her ears with her hands thinking im not prescient the trance doesnt work for me but the voice persisted it might work if you had help no no she whispered other voices wove around her mind i agamemnon your ancestor demand audience no no she pressed her hands against her ears until the flesh answered her with pain an insane cackle within her head asked what has become of ovid simple hes john bartletts ibid the names were meaningless in her extremity she wanted to scream against them and against all the other voices but could not find her own voice her guard sent back to the roof by senior attendants peered once more from the doorway behind the mimosa saw alia on the bench spoke to a companion ahhh she is resting you noted that she didnt sleep well last night it is good for her to take the zaha the morning siesta alia did not hear her guard her awareness was caught by shrieks of singing merry old birds are we hurrah the voices echoed against the inside of her skull and she thought im going insane im losing my mind her feet made feeble fleeing motions against the bench she felt that if she could only command her body to run she might escape she had to escape lest any part of that inner tide sweep her into silence forever contaminating her soul but her body would not obey the mightiest forces in the imperial universe would obey her slightest whim but her body would not an inner voice chuckled then from one viewpoint child each incident of creation represents a catastrophe it was a basso voice which rumbled against her eyes and again that chuckle as though deriding its own pontification my dear child i will help you but you must help me in return against the swelling background clamor behind that basso voice alia spoke through chattering teeth who who a face formed itself upon her awareness it was a smiling face of such fatness that it could have been a babys except for the glittering eagerness of the eyes she tried to pull back but achieved only a longer view which included the body attached to that face the body was grossly immensely fat clothed in a robe which revealed by subtle bulges beneath it that this fat had required the support of portable suspensors you see the basso voice rumbled it is only your maternal grandfather you know me i was the baron vladimir harkonnen youre youre dead she gasped but of course my dear most of us within you are dead but none of the others are really willing to help you they dont understand you go away she pleaded oh please go away but you need help granddaughter the barons voice argued how remarkable he looks she thought watching the projection of the baron against her closed eyelids im willing to help you the baron wheedled the others in here would only fight to take over your entire consciousness any one of them would try to drive you out but me i want only a little corner of my own again the other lives within her lifted their clamor the tide once more threatened to engulf her and she heard her mothers voice screeching and alia thought shes not dead shut up the baron commanded alia felt her own desires reinforcing that command making it felt throughout her awareness inner silence washed through her like a cool bath and she felt her hammering heart begin slowing to its normal pace soothingly the barons voice intruded you see together were invincible you help me and i help you what what do you want she whispered a pensive look came over the fat face against her closed eyelids ahhh my darling granddaughter he said i wish only a few simple pleasures give me but an occasional moment of contact with your senses no one else need ever know let me feel but a small corner of your life when for example you are enfolded in the arms of your lover is that not a small price to ask yyes good good the baron chortled in return my darling granddaughter i can serve you in many ways i can advise you help you with my counsel you will be invincible within and without you will sweep away all opposition history will forget your brother and cherish you the future will be yours you wont let the the others take over they can not stand against us singly we can be overcome but together we command i will demonstrate listen and the baron fell silent withdrawing his image his inner presence not one memory face or voice of the other lives intruded alia allowed herself a trembling sigh accompanying that sigh came a thought it forced itself into her awareness as though it were her own but she sensed silent voices behind it the old baron was evil he murdered your father he wouldve killed you and paul he tried to and failed the barons voice came to her without a face of course i wouldve killed you didnt you stand in my way but that argument is ended youve won it child youre the new truth she felt herself nodding and her cheek moved scratchingly against the harsh surface of the bench his words were reasonable she thought a bene gesserit precept reinforced the reasonable character of his words the purpose of argument is to change the nature of truth yes that was the way the bene gesserit would have it precisely the baron said and i am dead while you are alive i have only a fragile existence im a mere memoryself within you i am yours to command and how little i ask in return for the profound advice which is mine to deliver what do you advise me to do now she asked testing youre worried about the judgment you gave last night he said you wonder if paymons words were reported truthfully perhaps javid saw in this paymon a threat to his position of trust is this not the doubt which assails you yyes and your doubt is based on acute observation is it not javid behaves with increasing intimacy toward your person even duncan has noted it hasnt he you know he has very well then take javid for your lover and no you worry about duncan but your husband is a mentat mystic he can not be touched or harmed by activities of the flesh have you not felt sometimes how distant he is from you bbut he duncans mentat part would understand should he ever have need to know the device you employed in destroying javid destroy certainly dangerous tools may be used but they should be cast aside when they grow too dangerous then why should i mean ahhh you precious dunce because of the value contained in the lesson i dont understand values my dear grandchild depend for their acceptance upon their success javids obedience must be unconditional his acceptance of your authority absolute and his the morality of this lesson escapes dont be dense grandchild morality must always be based on practicality render unto caesar and all that nonsense a victory is useless unless it reflects your deepest wishes is it not true that you have admired javids manliness alia swallowed hating the admission but forced to it by her complete nakedness before the innerwatcher yees good how jovial the word sounded within her head now we begin to understand each other when you have him helpless then in your bed convinced that you are his thrall you will ask him about paymon do it jokingly a rich laugh between you and when he admits the deception you will slip a crysknife between his ribs ahhh the flow of blood can add so much to your satis no she whispered her mouth dry with horror no no no then i will do it for you the baron argued it must be done you admit that if you but set up the conditions i will assume temporary sway over no your fear is so transparent granddaughter my sway of your senses can not be else but temporary there are others now who could mimic you to a perfection that but you know this with me ahhh people would spy out my presence immediately you know the fremen law for those possessed youd be slain out of hand yes even you and you know i do not want that to happen ill take care of javid for you and once its done ill step aside you need only how is this good advice it rids you of a dangerous tool and child it sets up the working relationship between us a relationship which can only teach you well about future judgments which teach me naturally alia put her hands over her eyes trying to think knowing that any thought might be known to this presence within her that a thought might originate with that presence and be taken as her own you worry yourself needlessly the baron wheedled this paymon fellow now was what i did was wrong i was tired and acted hastily i shouldve sought confirmation of you did right your judgments can not be based on any such foolish abstract as that atreides notion of equality thats what kept you sleepless not paymons death you made a good decision he was another dangerous tool you acted to maintain order in your society now theres a good reason for judgments not this justice nonsense theres no such thing as equal justice anywhere its unsettling to a society when you try to achieve such a false balance alia felt pleasure at this defense of her judgment against paymon but shocked at the amoral concept behind the argument equal justice was an atreides was she took her hands from her eyes but kept her eyes closed all of your priestly judges should be admonished about this error the baron argued decisions must be weighed only as to their merit in maintaining an orderly society past civilizations without number have foundered on the rocks of equal justice such foolishness destroys the natural hierarchies which are far more important any individual takes on significance only in his relationship to your total society unless that society be ordered in logical steps no one can find a place in it not the lowliest or the highest come come grandchild you must be the stern mother of your people its your duty to maintain order everything paul did was to your brothers dead a failure so are you true but with me it was an accident beyond my designing come now let us take care of this javid as i have outlined for you she felt her body grow warm at the thought spoke quickly i must think about it and she thought if its done itll be only to put javid in his place no need to kill him for that and the fool might just give himself away in my bed to whom do you talk my lady a voice asked for a confused moment alia thought this another intrusion by those clamorous multitudes within but recognition of the voice opened her eyes ziarenka valefor chief of alias guardian amazons stood beside the bench a worried frown on her weathered fremen features i speak to my inner voices alia said sitting up on the bench she felt refreshed buoyed up by the silencing of that distracting inner clamor your inner voices my lady yes ziarenkas eyes glistened at this information everyone knew the holy alia drew upon inner resources available to no other person bring javid to my quarters alia said theres a serious matter i must discuss with him to your quarters my lady yes to my private chamber as my lady commands the guard turned to obey one moment alia said has master idaho already gone to sietch tabr yes my lady he left before dawn as you instructed do you wish me to send for no i will manage this myself and zia no one must know that javid is being brought to me do it yourself this is a very serious matter the guard touched the crysknife at her waist my lady is there a threat to yes theres a threat and javid may be at the heart of it ohhh my lady perhaps i should not bring zia do you think me incapable of handling such a one a lupine smile touched the guards mouth forgive me my lady i will bring him to your private chamber at once but with my ladys permission i will mount guard outside your door you only alia said yes my lady i go at once alia nodded to herself watching ziarenkas retreating back javid was not loved among her guards then another mark against him but he was still valuable very valuable he was her key to jacurutu and with that place well perhaps you were right baron she whispered you see the voice within her chortled ahhh this will be a pleasant service to you child and its only the beginning these are illusions of popular history which a successful religion must promote evil men never prosper only the brave deserve the fair honesty is the best policy actions speak louder than words virtue always triumphs a good deed is its own reward any bad human can be reformed religious talismans protect one from demon possession only females understand the ancient mysteries the rich are doomed to unhappiness from the instruction manual missionaria protectiva i am called muriz the leathery fremen said he sat on cavern rock in the glow of a spice lamp whose fluttering light revealed damp walls and dark holes which were passages from this place sounds of dripping water could be heard down one of those passages and although water sounds were essential to the fremen paradise the six bound men facing muriz took no pleasure from the rhythmic dripping there was the musty smell of a deathstill in the chamber a youth of perhaps fourteen standard years came out of the passage and stood at murizs left hand an unsheathed crysknife reflected pale yellow from the spice lamp as the youth lifted the blade and pointed it briefly at each of the bound men with a gesture toward the youth muriz said this is my son assan tariq who is about to undergo his test of manhood muriz cleared his throat stared once at each of the six captives they sat in a loose semicircle across from him tightly restrained with spicefiber ropes which held their legs crossed their hands behind them the bindings terminated in a tight noose at each mans throat their stillsuits had been cut away at the neck the bound men stared back at muriz without flinching two of them wore loose offworld garments which marked them as wealthy residents of an arrakeen city these two had skin which was smoother lighter than that of their companions whose sere features and bony frames marked them as desertborn muriz resembled the desert dwellers but his eyes were more deeply sunken whiteless pits which not even the glow of the spicelamp touched his son appeared an unformed copy of the man with a flatness of face which did not quite hide the turmoil boiling within him among the cast out we have a special test for manhood muriz said one day my son will be a judge in shuloch we must know that he can act as he must our judges can not forget jacurutu and our day of despair kralizec the typhoon struggle lives in our hearts it was all spoken with the flat intonation of ritual one of the softfeatured city dwellers across from muriz stirred said you do wrong to threaten us and bind us captive we came peacefully on umma muriz nodded you came in search of a personal religious awakening good you shall have that awakening the softfeatured man said if we beside him a darker desert fremen snapped be silent fool these are the water stealers these are the ones we thought wed wiped out that old story the softfeatured captive said jacurutu is more than a story muriz said once more he gestured to his son i have presented assan tariq i am arifa in this place your only judge my son too will be trained to detect demons the old ways are best thats why we came into the deep desert the softfeatured man protested we chose the old way wandering in with paid guides muriz said gesturing to the darker captives you would buy your way into heaven muriz glanced up at his son assan are you prepared i have reflected long upon that night when men came and murdered our people assan said his voice projected an uneasy straining they owe us water your father gives you six of them muriz said their water is ours their shades are yours your guardians forevermore their shades will warn you of demons they will be your slaves when you cross over into the alam almythal what do you say my son i thank my father assan said he took a short step forward i accept manhood among the cast out this water is our water as he finished speaking the youth crossed to the captives starting on the left he gripped the mans hair and drove the crysknife up under the chin into the brain it was skillfully done to spill the minimum blood only the one softfeatured city fremen protested squalling as the youth grabbed his hair the others spat at assan tariq in the old way saying by this see how little i value my water when it is taken by animals when it was done muriz clapped his hands once attendants came and began removing the bodies taking them to the deathstill where they could be rendered for their water muriz arose looked at his son who stood breathing deeply watching the attendants remove the bodies now you are a man muriz said the water of our enemies will feed slaves and my son assan tariq turned an alert and pouncing look upon his father the youths lips were drawn back in a tight smile the preacher must not know of this muriz said i understand father you did it well muriz said those who stumble upon shuloch must not survive as you say father you are trusted with important duties muriz said i am proud of you a sophisticated human can become primitive what this really means is that the humans way of life changes old values change become linked to the landscape with its plants and animals this new existence requires a working knowledge of those multiplex and crosslinked events usually referred to as nature it requires a measure of respect for the inertial power within such natural systems when a human gains this working knowledge and respect that is called being primitive the converse of course is equally true the primitive can become sophisticated but not without accepting dreadful psychological damage the leto commentary after harq alada how can we be sure ghanima asked this is very dangerous weve tested it before leto argued it may not be the same this time what if its the only way open to us leto said you agree we cant go the way of the spice ghanima sighed she did not like this thrust and parry of words but knew the necessity which pressed her brother she also knew the fearful source of her own reluctance they had but to look at alia and know the perils of that inner world well leto asked again she sighed they sat crosslegged in one of their private places a narrow opening from the cave to the cliff where often their mother and father had watched the sun set over the bled it was two hours past the evening meal a time when the twins were expected to exercise their bodies and their minds they had chosen to flex their minds i will try it alone if you refuse to help leto said ghanima looked away from him toward the black hangings of the moisture seals which guarded this opening in the rock leto continued to stare out over the desert they had been speaking for some time in a language so ancient that even its name remained unknown in these times the language gave their thoughts a privacy which no other human could penetrate even alia who avoided the intricacies of her inner world lacked the mental linkages which would allow her to grasp any more than an occasional word leto inhaled deeply taking in the distinctive furry odor of a fremen cavernsietch which persisted in this windless alcove the murmurous hubbub of the sietch and its damp heat were absent here and both felt this as a relief i agree we need guidance ghanima said but if we ghani we need more than guidance we need protection perhaps there is no protection she looked directly at her brother met that gaze in his eyes like the waiting watchfulness of a predator his eyes belied the placidity of his features we must escape possession leto said he used the special infinitive of the ancient language a form strictly neutral in voice and tense but profoundly active in its implications ghanima correctly interpreted his argument mohwpwium dmi hish pash mohm ka she intoned the capture of my soul is the capture of a thousand souls much more than that he countered knowing the dangers you persist she made it a statement not a question wabun k wabunat he said rising thou risest he felt his choice as an obvious necessity doing this thing it were best done actively they must wind the past into the present and allow it to unreel into their future muriyat she conceded her voice low it must be done lovingly of course he waved a hand to encompass total acceptance then we will consult as our parents did ghanima remained silent tried to swallow past a lump in her throat instinctively she glanced south toward the great open erg which was showing a dim grey pattern of dunes in the last of the days light in that direction her father had gone on his last walk into the desert leto stared downward over the cliff edge at the green of the sietch oasis all was dusk down there but he knew its shapes and colors blossoms of copper gold red yellow rust and russet spread right out to the rock markers which outlined the extent of the qanatwatered plantings beyond the rock markers stretched a stinking band of dead arrakeen life killed by foreign plants and too much water now forming a barrier against the desert presently ghanima said i am ready let us begin yes damn all he reached out touched her arm to soften the exclamation said please ghani sing that song it makes this easier for me ghanima hitched herself closer to him circled his waist with her left arm she drew in two deep breaths cleared her throat and began singing in a clear piping voice the words her mother had so often sung for their father here i redeem the pledge thou gavest i pour sweet water upon thee life shall prevail in this windless place my love thou shalt live in a palace thy enemies shall fall to emptiness we travel this path together which love has traced for thee surely well do i show the way for my love is thy palace her voice fell into the desert silence which even a whisper might despoil and leto felt himself sinking sinking becoming the father whose memories spread like an overlayer in the genes of his immediate past for this brief space i must be paul he told himself this is not ghani beside me it is my beloved chani whose wise counsel has saved us both many a time for her part ghanima had slipped into the personamemory of her mother with frightening ease as she had known she would how much easier this was for the female and how much more dangerous in a voice turned suddenly husky ghanima said look there beloved first moon had risen and against its cold light they saw an arc of orange fire falling upward into space the transport which had brought the lady jessica laden now with spice was returning to its mothercluster in orbit the keenest of remembrances ran through leto then bringing memories like bright bellsounds for a flickering instant he was another leto jessicas duke necessity pushed those memories aside but not before he felt the piercing of the love and the pain i must be paul he reminded himself the transformation came over him with a frightening duality as though leto were a dark screen against which his father was projected he felt both his own flesh and his fathers and the flickering differences threatened to overcome him help me father he whispered the flickering disturbance passed and now there was another imprint upon his awareness while his own identity as leto stood at one side as an observer my last vision has not yet come to pass he said and the voice was pauls he turned to ghanima you know what i saw she touched his cheek with her right hand did you walk into the desert to die beloved is that what you did it may be that i did but that vision would that not be reason enough to stay alive but blind she asked even so where could you go he took a deep shuddering breath jacurutu beloved tears began flowing down her cheeks muaddib the hero must be destroyed utterly he said otherwise this child can not bring us back from chaos the golden path she said it is not a good vision its the only possible vision alia has failed then utterly you see the record of it your mother has returned too late she nodded and it was chanis wise expression on the childish face of ghanima could there not be another vision perhaps if no beloved not yet this child can not peer into the future yet and return safely again a shuddering breath disturbed his body and letoobserver felt the deep longing of his father to live once more in vital flesh to make living decisions and how desperate the need to unmake past mistakes father leto called and it was as though he shouted echoingly within his own skull it was a profound act of will which leto felt then the slow clinging withdrawal of his fathers internal presence the release of senses and muscles beloved chanis voice whispered beside him and the withdrawal slowed what is happening dont go yet leto said and it was his own voice rasping and uncertain still his own then chani you must tell us how do we avoid what has happened to alia it was paulwithin who answered him though with words which fell upon his inner ear halting and with long pauses there is no certainty you saw what almost happened with me but alia the damned baron has her leto felt his throat burning with dryness is he have i hes in you but i we can not sometime we sense each other but you can you not read my thoughts leto asked would you know then if he sometimes i can feel your thoughts but i we live only through the reflection of your awareness your memory creates us the danger it is a precise memory and those of us those of us who loved power and gathered it at any price those can be more precise stronger leto whispered stronger i know your vision leto said rather than let him have me ill become you not that leto nodded to himself sensing the enormous willforce his father had required to withdraw recognizing the consequences of failure any possession reduced the possessed to abomination the recognition gave him a renewed sense of strength and he felt his own body with abnormal acuteness and a deeply drawn awareness of past mistakes his own and those of his ancestors it was the uncertainties which weakened he saw this now for an instant temptation warred with fear within him this flesh possessed the ability to transform melange into a vision of the future with the spice he could breathe the future shatter times veils he found the temptation difficult to shed clasped his hands and sank into the pranabindu awareness his flesh negated the temptation his flesh wore the deep knowledge learned in blood by paul those who sought the future hoped to gain the winning gamble on tomorrows race instead they found themselves trapped into a lifetime whose every heartbeat and anguished wail was known pauls final vision had shown the precarious way out of that trap and leto knew now that he had no other choice but to follow that way the joy of living its beauty is all bound up in the fact that life can surprise you he said a soft voice whispered in his ear ive always known that beauty leto turned his head stared into ghanimas eyes which glistened in the bright moonlight he saw chani looking back at him mother he said you must withdraw ahhh the temptation she said and kissed him he pushed her away would you take your daughters life he demanded its so easy so foolishly easy she said leto feeling panic begin to grip him remembered what an effort of will his fathers personawithin had required to abandon the flesh was ghanima lost in that observerworld where he had watched and listened learning what he had required from his father i will despise you mother he said others wont despise me she said be my beloved if i do you know what you both will become he said my father will despise you never i will the sound was jerked out of his throat without his volition and it carried all the old overtones of voice which paul had learned from his witch mother dont say it she moaned i will despise you please please dont say it leto rubbed his throat feeling the muscles become once more his own he will despise you he will turn his back on you he will go into the desert again no no she shook her head from side to side you must leave mother he said no no but the voice lacked its original force leto watched his sisters face how the muscles twitched emotions fled across the flesh at the turmoil within her leave he whispered leave noooo he gripped her arm felt the tremors which pulsed through her muscles the nerves twitching she writhed tried to pull away but he held tightly to her arm whispering leave leave and all the time leto berated himself for talking ghani into this parent game which once theyd played often but she had lately resisted it was true that the female had more weakness in that inner assault he realized there lay the origin of the bene gesserit fear hours passed and still ghanimas body trembled and twitched with the inner battle but now his sisters voice joined the argument he heard her talking to that image within the pleading mother please and once youve seen alia will you become another alia at last ghanima leaned against him whispered she has accepted it shes gone he stroked her head ghani im sorry im sorry ill never ask you to do that again i was selfish forgive me theres nothing to forgive she said and her voice came panting as though after great physical exertion weve learned much that we needed to know she spoke to you of many things he said well share it later when no well do it now you were right my golden path your damned golden path logics useless unless its armed with essential data he said but i grandmother came back to guide our education and to see if wed been contaminated thats what duncan says theres nothing new in prime computation she agreed her voice strengthening she pulled away from him looked out at the desert which lay in a predawn hush this battle this knowledge had cost them a night the royal guard beyond the moisture seal must have had much to explain leto had charged that nothing disturb them people often learn subtlety as they age leto said what is it were learning with all of this agedness to draw upon the universe as we see it is never quite the exact physical universe she said we mustnt perceive this grandmother just as a grandmother thatd be dangerous he agreed but my ques theres something beyond subtlety she said we must have a place in our awareness to perceive what we cant preconceive thats why my mother spoke to me often of jessica at the last when we were both reconciled to the inner exchange she said many things ghanima sighed we know shes our grandmother he said you were with her for hours yesterday is that why if we allow it our knowing will determine how we react to her ghanima said thats what my mother kept warning me she quoted our grandmother once and ghanima touched his arm i heard the echo of it within me in our grandmothers voice warning you leto said he found this thought disturbing was nothing in this world dependable most deadly errors arise from obsolete assumptions ghanima said thats what my mother kept quoting thats pure bene gesserit if if jessica has gone back to the sisterhood completely thatd be very dangerous to us he said completing the thought we carry the blood of their kwisatz haderach their male bene gesserit they wont abandon that search she said but they may abandon us our grandmother could be the instrument theres another way he said yes the two of us mated but they know what recessives might complicate that pairing its a gamble they mustve discussed and with our grandmother at that i dont like that way nor i still its not the first time a royal line has tried to it repels me he said shuddering she felt the movement fell silent power he said and in that strange alchemy of their similarities she knew where his thoughts had been the power of the kwisatz haderach must fail she agreed used in their way he said in that instant day came to the desert beyond their vantage point they sensed the heat beginning colors leaped forth from the plantings beneath the cliff greygreen leaves sent spiked shadows along the ground the low morning light of dunes silvery sun revealed the verdant oasis full of golden and purple shadows in the well of the sheltering cliffs leto stood stretched the golden path then ghanima said and she spoke as much to herself as to him knowing how their fathers last vision met and melted into letos dreams something brushed against the moisture seals behind them and voices could be heard murmuring there leto reverted to the ancient language they used for privacy lii ani howr samis smkwi owr samit sut that was where the decision lodged itself in their awareness literally we will accompany each other into deathliness though only one may return to report it ghanima stood then and together they returned through the moisture seals to the sietch where the guards roused themselves and fell in behind as the twins headed toward their own quarters the throngs parted before them with a difference on this morning exchanging glances with the guards spending the night alone above the desert was an old fremen custom for the holy sages all the uma had practiced this form of vigil paul muaddib had done it and alia now the royal twins had begun leto noted the difference mentioned it to ghanima they dont know what weve decided for them she said they dont really know still in the private language he said it requires the most fortuitous beginning ghanima hesitated a moment to form her thoughts then in that time mourning for the sibling it must be exactly real even to the making of the tomb the heart must follow the sleep lest there be no awakening in the ancient tongue it was an extremely convoluted statement employing a pronominal object separated from the infinitive it was a syntax which allowed each set of internal phrases to turn upon itself becoming several different meanings all definite and quite distinct but subtly interrelated in part what she had said was that they risked death with letos plan and real or simulated it made no difference the resultant change would be like death literally funeral murder and there was an added meaning to the whole which pointed accusatively at whoever survived to report that is act out the living part any misstep there would negate the entire plan and letos golden path would become a dead end extremely delicate leto agreed he parted the hangings for them as they entered their own anteroom activity among their attendants paused only for a heartbeat as the twins crossed to the arched passage which led into the quarters assigned to the lady jessica you are not osiris ghanima reminded him nor will i try to be ghanima took his arm to stop him alia darsatay haunus msmow she warned leto stared into his sisters eyes indeed alias actions did give off a foul smell which their grandmother must have noted he smiled appreciatively at ghanima she had mixed the ancient tongue with fremen superstition to call up a most basic tribal omen msmow the foul odor of a summer night was the harbinger of death at the hands of demons and isis had been the demongoddess of death to the people whose tongue they now spoke we atreides have a reputation for audacity to maintain he said so well take what we need she said its that or become petitioners before our own regency he said alia would enjoy that but our plan she let it trail off our plan he thought she shared it completely now he said i think of our plan as the toil of the shaduf ghanima glanced back at the anteroom through which theyd passed smelling the furry odors of morning with their sense of eternal beginning she liked the way leto had employed their private language toil of the shaduf it was a pledge hed called their plan agricultural work of a very menial kind fertilizing irrigating weeding transplanting pruning yet with the fremen implication that this labor occurred simultaneously in another world where it symbolized cultivating the richness of the soul ghanima studied her brother as they hesitated here in the rock passage it had grown increasingly obvious to her that he was pleading on two levels one for the golden path of his vision and their fathers and two that she allow him free reign to carry out the extremely dangerous mythcreation which the plan generated this frightened her was there more to his private vision that he had not shared could he see himself as the potentially deified figure to lead humankind into a rebirth like father like son the cult of muaddib had turned sour fermenting in alias mismanagement and the unbridled license of a military priesthood which rode the fremen power leto wanted regeneration hes hiding something from me she realized she reviewed what he had told her of his dream it held such iridescent reality that he might walk around for hours afterward in a daze the dream never varied he said i am on sand in bright yellow daylight yet there is no sun then i realize that i am the sun my light shines out as a golden path when i realize this i move out of myself i turn expecting to see myself as the sun but i am not the sun i am a stick figure a childs drawing with zigzag lightning lines for eyes stick legs and stick arms there is a scepter in my left hand and its a real scepter much more detailed in its reality than the stick figure which holds it the scepter moves and this terrifies me as it moves i feel myself awaken yet i know im still dreaming i realize then that my skin is encased in something an armor which moves as my skin moves i can not see this armor but i feel it my terror leaves me then for this armor gives me the strength of ten thousand men as ghanima stared at him leto tried to pull away to continue their course toward jessicas quarters ghanima resisted this golden path could be no better than any other path she said leto looked at the rock floor between them feeling the strong return of ghanimas doubts i must do it he said alia is possessed she said that could happen to us it could already have happened and we might not know it no he shook his head met her gaze alia resisted that gave the powers within her their strength by her own strength she was overcome weve dared to search within to seek out the old languages and the old knowledge were already amalgams of those lives within us we dont resist we ride with them this was what i learned from our father last night its what i had to learn he said nothing of that within me you listened to our mother its what we and i almost lost is she still strong within you fear tightened his face yes but now i think she guards me with her love you were very good when you argued with her and ghanima thought about the reflected motherwithin said our mother exists now for me in the alam almythal with the others but she has tasted the fruit of hell now i can listen to her without fear as to the others yes he said and i listened to my father but i think im really following the counsel of the grandfather for whom i was named perhaps the name makes it easy are you counseled to speak to our grandmother of the golden path leto waited while an attendant pressed past them with a baskettray carrying the lady jessicas breakfast a strong smell of spice filled the air as the attendant passed she lives in us and in her own flesh leto said her counsel can be consulted twice not by me ghanima protested im not risking that again then by me i thought we agreed that shes gone back to the sisterhood indeed bene gesserit at her beginning her own creature in the middle and bene gesserit at the end but remember that she too carries harkonnen blood and is closer to it than we are that she has experienced a form of this inner sharing which we have a very shallow form ghanima said and you havent answered my question i dont think ill mention the golden path i may ghani we dont need any more atreides gods we need a space for some humanity have i ever denied it no she took a deep breath and looked away from him attendants peered in at them from the anteroom hearing the argument by its tone but unable to understand the ancient words we have to do it he said if we fail to act we might just as well fall upon our knives he used the fremen form which carried the meaning of spill our water into the tribal cistern once more ghanima looked at him she was forced to agree but she felt trapped within a construction of many walls they both knew a day of reckoning lay across their path no matter what they did ghanima knew this with a certainty reinforced by the data garnered from those other memorylives but now she feared the strength which she gave those other psyches by using the data of their experiences they lurked like harpies within her shadow demons waiting in ambush except for her mother who had held the fleshly power and had renounced it ghanima still felt shaken by that inner struggle knowing she would have lost but for letos persuasiveness leto said his golden path led out of this trap except for the nagging realization that he withheld something from his vision she could only accept his sincerity he needed her fertile creativity to enrich the plan well be tested he said knowing where her doubts led not in the spice perhaps even there surely in the desert and in the trial of possession you never mentioned the trial of possession she accused is that part of your dream he tried to swallow in a dry throat cursed this betrayal yes then we will be possessed no she thought about the trial that ancient fremen examination whose ending most often brought hideous death then this plan had other complexities it would take them onto an edge where a plunge to either side might not be countenanced by the human mind and that mind remain sane knowing where her thoughts meandered leto said power attracts the psychotics always thats what we have to avoid within ourselves youre sure we wont be possessed not if we create the golden path still doubtful she said ill not bear your children leto he shook his head suppressing the inner betrayals lapsed into the royalformal form of the ancient tongue sister mine i love you more dearly than myself but that is not the tender of my desires very well then let us return to another argument before we join our grandmother a knife slipped into alia might settle most of our problems if you believe that you believe we can walk in mud and leave no tracks he said besides when has alia ever given anyone an opportunity there is talk about this javid does duncan show any signs of growing horns ghanima shrugged one poison two poison it was the common label applied to the royal habit of cataloguing companions by their threat to your person a mark of rulers everywhere we must do it my way he said the other way might be cleaner by her reply he knew she had finally suppressed her doubts and come around to agreement with his plan the realization brought him no happiness he found himself looking at his own hands wondering if the dirt would cling this was muaddibs achievement he saw the subliminal reservoir of each individual as an unconscious bank of memories going back to the primal cell of our common genesis each of us he said can measure out his distance from that common origin seeing this and telling of it he made the audacious leap of decision muaddib set himself the task of integrating genetic memory into ongoing evaluation thus did he break through times veils making a single thing of the future and the past that was muaddibs creation embodied in his son and his daughter testament of arrakis by harq alada faradn strode through the garden compound of his grandfathers royal palace watching his shadow grow shorter as the sun of salusa secundus climbed toward noon he had to stretch himself a bit to keep step with the tall bashar who accompanied him i have doubts tyekanik he said oh theres no denying the attractions of a throne but he drew in a deep breath i have so many interests tyekanik fresh from a savage argument with faradns mother glanced sidelong at the prince noting how the lads flesh was firming as he approached his eighteenth birthday there was less and less of wensicia in him with each passing day and more and more of old shaddam who had preferred his private pursuits to the responsibilities of royalty that was what had cost him the throne in the end of course hed grown soft in the ways of command you have to make a choice tyekanik said oh doubtless therell be time for some of your interests but faradn chewed his lower lip duty held him here but he felt frustrated he would far rather have gone to the rock enclave where the sandtrout experiments were being conducted now there was a project with enormous potential wrest the spice monopoly from the atreides and anything might happen youre sure these twins will be eliminated nothing absolutely certain my prince but the prospects are good faradn shrugged assassination remained a fact of royal life the language was filled with the subtle permutations of ways to eliminate important personages by a single word one could distinguish between poison in drink or poison in food he presumed the elimination of the atreides twins would be accomplished by a poison it was not a pleasant thought by all accounts the twins were a most interesting pair would we have to move to arrakis faradn asked its the best choice put us at the point of greatest pressure faradn appeared to be avoiding some question and tyekanik wondered what it might be im troubled tyekanik faradn said speaking as they rounded a hedge corner and approached a fountain surrounded by giant black roses gardeners could be heard snipping beyond the hedges yes tyekanik prompted this ah religion which youve professed nothing strange about that my prince tyekanik said and hoped his voice remained firm this religion speaks to the warrior in me its a fitting religion for a sardaukar that at least was true yesss but my mother seems so pleased by it damn wensicia he thought shes made her son suspicious i care not what your mother thinks tyekanik said a mans religion is his own affair perhaps she sees something in this that may help to put you on the throne that was my thought faradn said ahhh this is a sharp lad tyekanik thought he said look into the religion for yourself youll see at once why i chose it still muaddibs preachings he was an atreides after all i can only say that the ways of god are mysterious tyekanik said i see tell me tyek whyd you ask me to walk with you just now its almost noon and usually youre off to someplace or other at my mothers command this time of day tyekanik stopped at a stone bench which looked upon the fountain and the giant roses beyond the splashing water soothed him and he kept his attention upon it as he spoke my prince ive done something which your mother may not like and he thought if he believes that her damnable scheme will work tyekanik almost hoped wensicias scheme would fail bringing that damnable preacher here she was insane and the cost as tyekanik remained silent waiting faradn asked all right tyek whatve you done ive brought a practitioner of oneiromancy tyekanik said faradn shot a sharp glance at his companion some of the older sardaukar played the dreaminterpretation game had done so increasingly since their defeat by that supreme dreamer muaddib somewhere within their dreams they reasoned might lay a way back to power and glory but tyekanik had always eschewed this play this doesnt sound like you tyek faradn said then i can only speak from my new religion he said addressing the fountain to speak of religion was of course why theyd risked bringing the preacher here then speak from this religion faradn said as my prince commands he turned looked at this youthful holder of all the dreams which now were distilled into the path which house corrino would follow church and state my prince even scientific reason and faith and even more progress and tradition all of these are reconciled in the teachings of muaddib he taught that there are no intransigent opposites except in the beliefs of men and sometimes in their dreams one discovers the future in the past and both are part of a whole in spite of doubts which he could not dispel faradn found himself impressed by these words he heard a note of reluctant sincerity in tyekaniks voice as though the man spoke against inner compulsions and thats why you bring me this this interpreter of dreams yes my prince perhaps your dream penetrates time you win back your consciousness of your inner being when you recognize the universe as a coherent whole your dreams well but i spoke idly of my dreams faradn protested they are a curiosity no more i never once suspected that you my prince nothing you do can be unimportant thats very flattering tyek do you really believe this fellow can see into the heart of great mysteries i do my prince then let my mother be displeased you will see him of course since youve brought him to displease my mother does he mock me tyekanik wondered and he said i must warn you that the old man wears a mask it is an ixian device which enables the sightless to see with their skin he is blind yes my prince does he know who i am i told him my prince very well let us go to him if my prince will wait a moment here i will bring the man to him faradn looked around the fountain garden smiled as good a place as any for this foolishness have you told him what i dreamed only in general terms my prince he will ask you for a personal accounting oh very well ill wait here bring the fellow faradn turned his back heard tyekanik retire in haste a gardener could be seen working just beyond the hedge the top of a browncapped head the flashing of shears poking above the greenery the movement was hypnotic this dream business is nonsense faradn thought it was wrong of tyek to do this without consulting me strange that tyek should get religion at his age and now its dreams presently he heard footsteps behind him tyekaniks familiar positive stride and a more dragging gait faradn turned stared at the approaching dream interpreter the ixian mask was a black gauzy affair which concealed the face from the forehead to below the chin there were no eye slits in the mask if one were to believe the ixian boasts the entire mask was a single eye tyekanik stopped two paces from faradn but the masked old man approached to less than a pace the interpreter of dreams tyekanik said faradn nodded the masked old man coughed in a remote grunting fashion as though trying to bring something up from his stomach faradn was acutely conscious of a sour spice smell from the old man it emanated from the long grey robe which covered his body is that mask truly a part of your flesh faradn asked realizing he was trying to delay the subject of dreams while i wear it the old man said and his voice carried a bitter twang and just a suggestion of fremen accent your dream he said tell me faradn shrugged why not that was why tyek had brought the old man or was it doubts gripped faradn and he asked are you truly a practitioner of oneiromancy i have come to interpret your dream puissant lord again faradn shrugged this masked figure made him nervous and he glanced at tyekanik who remained where he had stopped arms folded staring at the fountain your dream then the old man pressed faradn inhaled deeply began to relate the dream it became easier to talk as he got fully into it he told about the water flowing upward in the well about the worlds which were atoms dancing in his head about the snake which transformed itself into a sandworm and exploded in a cloud of dust telling about the snake he was surprised to discover required more effort a terrible reluctance inhibited him and this made him angry as he spoke the old man remained impassive as faradn at last fell silent the black gauze mask moved slightly to his breathing faradn waited the silence continued presently faradn asked arent you going to interpret my dream i have interpreted it he said his voice seeming to come from a long distance well faradn heard his own voice squeaking telling him the tension his dream had produced still the old man remained impassively silent tell me then the anger was obvious in his tone i said id interpret the old man said i did not agree to tell you my interpretation even tyekanik was moved by this dropping his arms into balled fists at his sides what he grated i did not say id reveal my interpretation the old man said you wish more pay faradn asked i did not ask pay when i was brought here a certain cold pride in the response softened faradns anger this was a brave old man at any rate he must know death could follow disobedience allow me my prince tyekanik said as faradn started to speak then will you tell us why you wont reveal your interpretation yes my lords the dream tells me there would be no purpose in explaining these things faradn could not contain himself are you saying i already know the meaning of my dream perhaps you do my lord but that is not my gist tyekanik moved up to stand beside faradn both glared at the old man explain yourself tyekanik said indeed faradn said if i were to speak of this dream to explore these matters of water and dust snakes and worms to analyze the atoms which dance in your head as they do in mine ahh puissant lord my words would only confuse you and you would insist upon misunderstanding do you fear that your words might anger me faradn demanded my lord youre already angry is it that you dont trust us tyekanik asked that is very close to the mark my lord i do not trust either of you and for the simple reason that you do not trust yourselves you walk dangerously close to the edge tyekanik said men have been killed for behavior less abusive than yours faradn nodded said dont tempt us to anger the fatal consequences of corrino anger are well known my lord of salusa secundus the old man said tyekanik put a restraining hand on faradns arm asked are you trying to goad us into killing you faradn had not thought of that felt a chill now as he considered what such behavior might mean was this old man who called himself preacher was he more than he appeared what might be the consequences of his death martyrs could be dangerous creations i doubt that youll kill me no matter what i say the preacher said i think you know my value bashar and your prince now suspects it you absolutely refuse to interpret his dream tyekanik asked i have interpreted it and you will not reveal what you see in it do you blame me my lord how can you be valuable to me faradn asked the preacher held out his right hand if i but beckon with this hand duncan idaho will come to me and he will obey me what idle boast is this faradn asked but tyekanik shook his head recalling his argument with wensicia he said my prince it could be true this preacher has many followers on dune why didnt you tell me he was from that place faradn asked before tyekanik could answer the preacher addressed faradn my lord you must not feel guilty about arrakis you are but a product of your times this is a special pleading which any man may make when his guilts assail him guilts faradn was outraged the preacher only shrugged oddly this shifted faradn from outrage to amusement he laughed throwing his head back drawing a startled glance from tyekanik then i like you preacher this gratifies me prince the old man said suppressing a chuckle faradn said well find you an apartment here in the palace you will be my official interpreter of dreams even though you never give me a word of interpretation and you can advise me about dune i have a great curiosity about that place this i can not do prince an edge of his anger returned faradn glared at the black mask and why not pray tell my prince tyekanik said again touching faradns arm what is it tyek we brought him here under bonded agreement with the guild he is to be returned to dune i am summoned back to arrakis the preacher said who summons you faradn demanded a power greater than thine prince faradn shot a questioning glance at tyekanik is he an atreides spy not likely my prince alia has put a price on his head if its not the atreides then who summons you faradn asked returning his attention to the preacher a power greater than the atreides a chuckle escaped faradn this was only mystic nonsense how could tyek be fooled by such stuff this preacher had been summoned most likely by a dream of what importance were dreams this has been a waste of time tyek faradn said why did you subject me to this this farce there is a double price here my prince tyekanik said this interpreter of dreams promised me to deliver duncan idaho as an agent of house corrino all he asked was to meet you and interpret your dream and tyekanik added to himself or so he told wensicia new doubts assailed the bashar why is my dream so important to you old man faradn asked your dream tells me that great events move toward a logical conclusion the preacher said i must hasten my return mocking faradn said and you will remain inscrutable giving me no advice advice prince is a dangerous commodity but i will venture a few words which you may take as advice or in any other way which pleases you by all means faradn said the preacher held his masked face rigidly confronting faradn governments may rise and fall for reasons which appear insignificant prince what small events an argument between two women which way the wind blows on a certain day a sneeze a cough the length of a garment or the chance collision of a fleck of sand and a courtiers eye it is not always the majestic concerns of imperial ministers which dictate the course of history nor is it necessarily the pontifications of priests which move the hands of god faradn found himself profoundly stirred by these words and could not explain his emotion tyekanik however had focused on one phrase why did this preacher speak of a garment tyekaniks mind focused on the imperial costumes dispatched to the atreides twins the tigers trained to attack was this old man voicing a subtle warning how much did he know how is this advice faradn asked if you would succeed the preacher said you must reduce your strategy to its point of application where does one apply strategy at a particular place and with a particular people in mind but even with the greatest concern for minutiae some small detail with no significance attached to it will escape you can your strategy prince be reduced to the ambitions of a regional governors wife his voice cold tyekanik interrupted why do you harp upon strategy preacher what is it you think my prince will have he is being led to desire a throne the preacher said i wish him good luck but he will need much more than luck these are dangerous words faradn said how is it you dare such words ambitions tend to remain undisturbed by realities the preacher said i dare such words because you stand at a crossroad you could become admirable but now you are surrounded by those who do not seek moral justifications by advisers who are strategy oriented you are young and strong and tough but you lack a certain advanced training by which your character might evolve this is sad because you have weaknesses whose dimensions i have described what do you mean tyekanik demanded have a care when you speak faradn said what is this weakness youve given no thought to the kind of society you might prefer the preacher said you do not consider the hopes of your subjects even the form of the imperium which you seek has little shape in your imaginings he turned his masked face toward tyekanik your eye is upon the power not upon its subtle uses and its perils your future is filled thus with manifest unknowns with arguing women with coughs and windy days how can you create an epoch when you can not see every detail your tough mind will not serve you this is where you are weak faradn studied the old man for a long space wondering at the deeper issues implied by such thoughts at the persistence of such discredited concepts morality social goals these were myths to put beside belief in an upward movement of evolution tyekanik said weve had enough words what of the price agreed upon preacher duncan idaho is yours the preacher said have a care how you use him he is a jewel beyond price oh weve a suitable mission for him tyekanik said he glanced at faradn by your leave my prince send him packing before i change my mind faradn said then glaring at tyekanik i dont like the way youve used me tyek forgive him prince the preacher said your faithful bashar does gods will without even knowing it bowing the preacher departed and tyekanik hurried to see him away faradn watched the retreating backs thought i must look into this religion which tyek espouses and he smiled ruefully what a dream interpreter but what matter my dream was not an important thing and he saw a vision of armor the armor was not his own skin it was stronger than plasteel nothing penetrated his armor not knife or poison or sand not the dust of the desert or its desiccating heat in his right hand he carried the power to make the coriolis storm to shake the earth and erode it into nothing his eyes were fixed upon the golden path and in his left hand he carried the scepter of absolute mastery and beyond the golden path his eyes looked into eternity which he knew to be the food of his soul and of his everlasting flesh heighia my brothers dream from the book of ghanima itd be better for me never to become emperor leto said oh i dont imply that ive made my fathers mistake and peered into the future with a glass of spice i say this thing out of selfishness my sister and i desperately need a time of freedom when we can learn how to live with what we are he fell silent stared questioningly at the lady jessica hed spoken his piece as he and ghanima had agreed now what would be their grandmothers response jessica studied her grandson in the low light of glowglobes which illuminated her quarters in sietch tabr it was still early morning of her second day here and shed already had disturbing reports that the twins had spent a night of vigil outside the sietch what were they doing she had not slept well and she felt fatigue acids demanding that she come down from the hyperlevel which had sustained her through all the demanding necessities since that crucial performance at the spaceport this was the sietch of her nightmares but outside that was not the desert she remembered where have all the flowers come from and the air around her felt too damp stillsuit discipline was lax among the young what are you child that you need time to learn about yourself she asked he shook his head gently knowing it to be a bizarre gesture of adulthood on a childs body reminding himself that he must keep this woman off balance first i am not a child oh he touched his chest this is a childs body no doubt of that but i am not a child jessica chewed her upper lip disregarding what this betrayed her duke so many years dead on this accursed planet had laughed at her when she did this your one unbridled response hed called that chewing of the lip it tells me that youre disturbed and i must kiss those lips to still their fluttering now this grandson who bore the name of her duke shocked her into heartpounding stillness merely by smiling and saying you are disturbed i see it by the fluttering of those lips it required the most profound discipline of her bene gesserit training to restore a semblance of calm she managed do you taunt me taunt you never but i must make it clear to you how much we differ let me remind you of that sietch orgy so long ago when the old reverend mother gave you her lives and her memories she tuned herself to you and gave you that that long chain of sausages each one a person you have them yet so you know something of what ghanima and i experience and alia jessica asked testing him didnt you discuss that with ghani i wish to discuss it with you very well alia denied what she was and became that which she most feared the pastwithin can not be relegated to the unconscious that is a dangerous course for any human but for us who are preborn it is worse than death and that is all i will say about alia so youre not a child jessica said im millions of years old that requires adjustments which humans have never before been called upon to make jessica nodded calmer now much more cautious than shed been with ghanima and where was ghanima why had leto come here alone well grandmother he said are we abominations or are we the hope of the atreides jessica ignored the question where is your sister she distracts alia to keep us from being disturbed it is necessary but ghani would say nothing more to you than ive said didnt you observe that yesterday what i observed yesterday is my affair why do you prattle about abomination prattle dont give me your bene gesserit cant grandmother ill feed it back to you word for word right out of your own memories i want more than the fluttering of your lips jessica shook her head feeling the coldness of this person who carried her blood the resources at his disposal daunted her she tried to match his tone asked what do you know of my intentions he sniffed you neednt inquire whether ive made the mistake my father made ive not looked outside our garden of time at least not by seeking it out leave absolute knowledge of the future to those moments of deja vu which any human may experience i know the trap of prescience my fathers life tells me what i need to know about it no grandmother to know the future absolutely is to be trapped into that future absolutely it collapses time present becomes future i require more freedom than that jessica felt her tongue twitch with unspoken words how could she respond to him with something he didnt already know this was monstrous hes me hes my beloved leto this thought shocked her momentarily she wondered if the childish mask might not lapse into those dear features and resurrect no leto lowered his head looked upward to study her yes she could be maneuvered after all he said when you think of prescience which i hope is rarely youre probably no different from any other most people imagine how nice it would be to know tomorrows quotation on the price of whale fur or whether a harkonnen will once more govern their homeworld of giedi prime but of course we know the harkonnens without prescience dont we grandmother she refused to rise to his baiting of course he would know about the cursed harkonnen blood in his ancestry who is a harkonnen he asked goading who is beast rabban any one of us eh but i digress i speak the popular myth of prescience to know the future absolutely all of it what fortunes could be made and lost on such absolute knowledge eh the rabble believes this they believe that if a little bit is good more must be better how excellent and if you handed one of them the complete scenario of his life the unvarying dialogue up to his moment of death what a hellish gift thatd be what utter boredom every living instant hed be replaying what he knew absolutely no deviation he could anticipate every response every utterance over and over and over and over and over and leto shook his head ignorance has its advantages a universe of surprises is what i pray for it was a long speech and as she listened jessica marveled at how his mannerisms his intonations echoed his father her lost son even the ideas these were things paul might have said you remind me of your father she said is that hurtful to you in a way but its reassuring to know he lives on in you how little you understand of how he lives on in me jessica found his tone flat but dripping bitterness she lifted her chin to look directly at him or how your duke lives in me leto said grandmother ghanima is you shes you to such an extent that your life holds not a single secret from her up to the instant you bore our father and me what a catalogue of fleshly recordings am i there are moments when it is too much to bear you come here to judge us you come here to judge alia better that we judge you jessica demanded answer of herself and found none what was he doing why this emphasis on his difference did he court rejection had he reached alias condition abomination this disturbs you he said it disturbs me she permitted herself a futile shrug yes it disturbs me and for reasons you know full well im sure youve reviewed my bene gesserit training ghanima admits it i know alia did you know the consequences of your difference he peered upward at her with disturbing intensity almost we did not take this tack with you he said and there was a sense of her own fatigue in his voice we know the fluttering of your lips as your lover knew them any bedchamber endearment your duke whispered is ours to recall at will youve accepted this intellectually no doubt but i warn you that intellectual acceptance is not enough if any of us becomes abomination it could be you within us who creates it or my father or mother your duke any one of you could possess us and the condition would be the same jessica felt a burning in her chest dampness in her eyes leto she managed allowing herself to use his name at last she found the pain less than shed imagined it would be forced herself to continue what is it you want of me i would teach my grandmother teach me what last night ghani and i played the motherfather roles almost to our destruction but we learned much there are things one can know given an awareness of conditions actions can be predicted alia now its well nigh certainty that shes plotting to abduct you jessica blinked shocked by the swift accusation she knew this trick well had employed it many times set a person up along one line of reasoning then introduce the shocker from another line she recovered with a sharp intake of breath i know what alia has been doing what she is but grandmother pity her use your heart as well as your intelligence youve done that before you pose a threat and alia wants the imperium for her own at least the thing she has become wants this how do i know this isnt another abomination speaking he shrugged thats where your heart comes in ghani and i know how she fell it isnt easy to adjust to the clamor of that inner multitude suppress their egos and they will come crowding back every time you invoke a memory one day he swallowed in a dry throat a strong one from that inner pack decides its time to share the flesh and theres nothing you can do she asked the question although she feared the answer we believe there is something yes we can not succumb to the spice thats paramount and we must not suppress the past entirely we must use it make an amalgam of it finally we will mix them all into ourselves we will no longer be our original selves but we will not be possessed you speak of a plot to abduct me its obvious wensicia is ambitious for her son alia is ambitious for herself and alia and faradn thats not indicated he said but alia and wensicia run parallel courses right now wensicia has a sister in alias house what simpler thing than a message to you know of such a message as though id seen it and read its every word but youve not seen such a message no need i have only to know that the atreides are all here together on arrakis all of the water in one cistern he gestured to encompass the planet house corrino wouldnt dare attack us here alia would profit if they did a sneer in his voice provoked her i wont be patronized by my own grandson she said then dammit woman stop thinking of me as your grandson think of me as your duke leto tone and facial expression even the abrupt hand gesture were so exact that she fell silent in confusion in a dry remote voice leto said i tried to prepare you give me that at least why would alia abduct me to blame it on house corrino of course i dont believe it even for her this would be monstrous too dangerous how could she do it without i can not believe this when it happens youll believe ahh grandmother ghani and i have but to eavesdrop within ourselves and we know its simple selfpreservation how else can we even guess at the mistakes being made around us i do not for a minute accept that abduction is part of alias gods below how can you a bene gesserit be this dense the whole imperium suspects why youre here wensicias propagandists are all prepared to discredit you alia cant wait for that to happen if you go down house atreides could suffer a mortal blow what does the whole imperium suspect she measured out the words as coldly as possible knowing she could not sway this unchild with any wile of voice the lady jessica plans to breed those twins together he rasped thats what the sisterhood wants incest she blinked idle rumor she swallowed the bene gesserits will not let such a rumor run wild in the imperium we still have some influence remember that rumor what rumor youve certainly held your options open on interbreeding us he shook his head as she started to speak dont deny it let us pass puberty still living in the same household and you in that household and your influence will be no more than a rag waved in the face of a sandworm do you believe us to be such utter fools jessica asked indeed i do your sisterhood is nothing but a bunch of damn fool old women who havent thought beyond their precious breeding program ghani and i know the leverage they have do you think us fools leverage they know youre a harkonnen itll be in their breeding records jessica out of tanidia nerus by the baron vladimir harkonnen that record accidentally made public would pull your teeth to you think the sisterhood would stoop to blackmail i know they would oh they coated it sweetly they told you to investigate the rumors about your daughter they fed your curiosity and your fears they invoked your sense of responsibility made you feel guilty because youd fled back to caladan and they offered you the prospect of saving your grandchildren jessica could only stare at him in silence it was as though hed eavesdropped on the emotional meetings with her proctors from the sisterhood she felt completely subdued by his words and now began to accept the possibility that he spoke truth when he said alia planned abduction you see grandmother i have a difficult decision to make he said do i follow the atreides mystique do i live for my subjects and die for them or do i choose another course one which would permit me to live thousands of years jessica recoiled involuntarily these words spoken so easily touched on a subject the bene gesserits made almost unthinkable many reverend mothers could choose that course or try it the manipulation of internal chemistry was available to initiates of the sisterhood but if one did it sooner or later all would try it there could be no concealing such an accumulation of ageless women they knew for a certainty that this course would lead them to destruction shortlived humanity would turn upon them no it was unthinkable i dont like the trend of your thoughts she said you dont understand my thoughts he said ghani and i he shook his head alia had it in her grasp and threw it away are you sure of that ive already sent word to the sisterhood that alia practices the unthinkable look at her shes not aged a day since last i oh that he dismissed bene gesserit body balance with a wave of his hand im speaking of something else a perfection of being far beyond anything humans have ever before achieved jessica remained silent aghast at how easily hed lifted her disclosure from her hed know surely that such a message represented a death sentence on alia and no matter how he changed the words he could only be talking about committing the same offense didnt he know the peril of his words you must explain she said finally how he asked unless you understand that time isnt what it appears i cant even begin to explain my father suspected it he stood at the edge of realization but fell back now its up to ghani and me i insist that you explain jessica said and she fingered the poisoned needle she held beneath a fold of her robe it was the gom jabbar so deadly that the slightest prick of it killed within seconds and she thought they warned me i might have to use it the thought sent the muscles of her arm trembling in waves and she was thankful for the concealing robe very well he sighed first as to time there is no difference between ten thousand years and one year no difference between one hundred thousand years and a heartbeat no difference that is the first fact about time and the second fact the entire universe with all of its time is within me what nonsense is this she demanded you see you dont understand i will try to explain in another way then he raised his right hand to illustrate moving it as he spoke we go forward we come back those words explain nothing that is correct he said there are things which words can not explain you must experience them without words but you are not prepared for such a venture just as when you look at me you do not see me but im looking directly at you of course i see you she glared at him his words reflected knowledge of the zensunni codex as shed been taught it in the bene gesserit schools play of words to confuse ones understanding of philosophy some things occur beyond your control he said how does that explain this this perfection which is so far beyond other human experiences he nodded if one delays old age or death by the use of melange or by that learned adjustment of fleshly balance which you bene gesserits so rightly fear such a delay invokes only an illusion of control whether one walks rapidly through the sietch or slowly one traverses the sietch and that passage of time is experienced internally why do you bandy words this way i cut my wisdom teeth on such nonsense long before even your father was born but only the teeth grew he said words words ahhh youre very close hah grandmother yes he held his silence for a long space then you see you can still respond as yourself he smiled at her but you can not see past the shadows i am here again he smiled my father came very near to this when he lived he lived but when he died he failed to die whatre you saying show me his body do you think this preacher possible but even so that is not his body youve explained nothing she accused just as i warned you then why you asked you had to be shown now let us return to alia and her plan of abduction for are you planning the unthinkable she demanded holding the poisonous gom jabbar at the ready beneath her robe will you be her executioner he asked his voice deceptively mild he pointed a finger at the hand beneath her robe do you think shell permit you to use that or do you think id let you use it jessica found she could not swallow in answer to your question he said i do not plan the unthinkable i am not that stupid but i am shocked at you you dare judge alia of course shes broken the precious bene gesserit commandment whatd you expect you ran out on her left her as queen here in all but name all of that power so you ran back to caladan to nurse your wounds in gurneys arms good enough but who are you to judge alia i tell you i will not dis oh shut up he looked away from her in disgust but his words had been uttered in that special bene gesserit way the controlling voice it silenced her as though a hand had been clapped over her mouth she thought whod know how to hit me with voice better than this one it was a mitigating argument which eased her wounded feelings as many times as shed used voice on others shed never expected to be susceptible to it not ever again not since the school days when he turned back to her im sorry i just happen to know how blindly you can be expected to react when blindly me she was more outraged by this than shed been by his exquisite use of voice against her you he said blindly if youve any honesty left in you at all youll recognize your own reactions i call your name and you say yes i silence your tongue i invoke all your bene gesserit myths look inward the way you were taught that at least is something you can do for your how dare you what do you know of her voice trailed off of course he knew look inward i say his voice was imperious again his voice enthralled her she found her senses stilled felt a quickening of breath just beyond awareness lurked a pounding heart the panting of abruptly she realized that the quickened breath the pounding heart were not latent not held at bay by her bene gesserit control eyes widening in shocked awareness she felt her own flesh obeying other commands slowly she recovered her poise but the realization remained this unchild had been playing her like a fine instrument throughout their interview now you know how profoundly you were conditioned by your precious bene gesserits he said she could only nod her belief in words lay shattered leto had forced her to look her physical universe squarely in the face and shed come away shaken her mind running with a new awareness show me his body hed shown her her own body as though it were newborn not since her earliest schooling days on wallach not since those terrifying days before the dukes buyers came for her not since then had she felt such trembling uncertainty about her next moments you will allow yourself to be abducted leto said but im not asking for discussion on this point he said you will allow it think of this as a command from your duke youll see the purpose when its done youre going to confront a very interesting student leto stood nodded he said some actions have an end but no beginning some begin but do not end it all depends upon where the observer is standing turning he left her chambers in the second anteroom leto met ghanima hurrying into their private quarters she stopped as she saw him said alias busy with the convocation of the faith she looked a question at the passage which led to jessicas quarters atrocity is recognized as such by victim and perpetrator alike by all who learn about it at whatever remove atrocity has no excuses no mitigating argument atrocity never balances or rectifies the past atrocity merely arms the future for more atrocity it is selfperpetuating upon itself a barbarous form of incest whoever commits atrocity also commits those future atrocities thus bred the apocrypha of muaddib shortly after noon when most of the pilgrims had wandered off to refresh themselves in whatever cooling shade and source of libation they could find the preacher entered the great square below alias temple he came on the arm of his surrogate eyes young assan tariq in a pocket beneath his flowing robe the preacher carried the black gauze mask hed worn on salusa secundus it amused him to think that the mask and the boy served the same purpose disguise while he needed surrogate eyes doubts remained alive let the myth grow but keep doubts alive he thought no one must discover that the mask was merely cloth not an ixian artifact at all his hand must not slip from assan tariqs bony shoulder let the preacher once walk as the sighted despite his eyeless sockets and all doubts would dissolve the small hope he nursed would be dead each day he prayed for a change something different over which he might stumble but even salusa secundus had been a pebble every aspect known nothing changed nothing could be changed yet many people marked his passage past the shops and arcades noting the way he turned his head from side to side holding it centered on a doorway or a person the movements of his head were not always blindnatural and this added to the growing myth alia watched from a concealed slit in the towering battlement of her temple she searched that scarred visage far below for some sign a sure sign of identity every rumor was reported to her each new one came with its thrill of fear shed thought her order to take the preacher captive would remain secret but that too came back to her now as a rumor even among her guards someone could not remain silent she hoped now that the guards would follow her new orders and not take this robed mystery captive in a public place where it could be seen and reported it was dusty hot in the square the preachers young guide had pulled the veil of his robe up around his nose leaving only the dark eyes and a thin patch of forehead exposed the veil bulged with the outline of a stillsuits catchtube this told alia that theyd come in from the desert where did they hide out there the preacher wore no veil protection from the searing air he had even dropped the catchtube flap of his stillsuit his face lay open to the sunlight and the heat shiverings which lifted off the squares paving blocks in visible waves at the temple steps there stood a group of nine pilgrims making their departure obeisance the shadowed edge of the square held perhaps fifty more persons mostly pilgrims devoting themselves to various penances imposed by the priesthood among the onlookers could be seen messengers and a few merchants whod not yet made enough sales to close up for the worst of the days heat watching from the open slit alia felt the drenching heat and knew herself to be caught between thinking and sensation the way shed often seen her brother caught the temptation to consult within herself rang like an ominous humming in her head the baron was there dutiful but always ready to play upon her terrors when rational judgment failed and the things around her lost their sense of past present and future what if thats paul down there she asked herself nonsense the voice within her said but the reports of the preachers words could not be doubted heresy it terrified her to think that paul himself might bring down the structure built on his name why not she thought of what shed said in council just that morning turning viciously upon irulan whod urged acceptance of the gift of clothing from house corrino all gifts to the twins will be examined thoroughly just as always irulan had argued and when we find the gift harmless alia had cried somehow that had been the most frightening thing of all to find that the gift carried no threat in the end theyd accepted the fine clothing and had gone on to the other issue was the lady jessica to be given a position on the council alia had managed to delay a vote she thought of this as she stared down at the preacher things which happened to her regency now were like the underside of that transformation they inflicted upon this planet dune had once symbolized the power of ultimate desert that power dwindled physically but the myth of its power grew apace only the oceandesert remained the great mother desert of the inner planet with its rim of thorn bushes which fremen still called queen of night behind the thorn bushes arose soft green hills bending down to the sand all the hills were manmade every last one of them had been planted by men who had labored like crawling insects the green of those hills was almost overpowering to someone raised as alia had been in the tradition of dunshaded sand in her mind as in the minds of all fremen the oceandesert still held dune in a grip which would never relax she had only to close her eyes and she would see that desert open eyes at the desert edge saw now the verdant hills marsh slime reaching out green pseudopods toward the sand but the other desert remained as powerful as ever alia shook her head stared down at the preacher he had mounted the first of the terraced steps below the temple and turned to face the almost deserted square alia touched the button beside her window which would amplify voices from below she felt a wave of selfpity seeing herself held here in loneliness whom could she trust shed thought stilgar remained reliable but stilgar had been infected by this blind man you know how he counts stilgar had asked her i heard him counting coins as he paid his guide its very strange to my fremen ears and thats a terrible thing he counts shuc ishcai qimsa chuascu picha sucta and so on ive not heard counting like that since the old days in the desert from this alia knew that stilgar could not be sent to do the job which must be done and she would have to be circumspect with her guards where the slightest emphasis from the regency tended to be taken as absolute command what was he doing down there this preacher the surrounding marketplace beneath its protective balconies and arched arcade still presented a gaudy face merchandise left on display with a few boys to watch over it some few merchants remained awake there sniffing for the spicebiscuit money of the back country or the jingle in a pilgrims purse alia studied the preachers back he appeared poised for speech but something withheld his voice why do i stand here watching that ruin in ancient flesh she asked herself that mortal wreckage down there can not he the vessel of magnificence which once was my brother frustration bordering on anger filled her how could she find out about the preacher find out for certain without finding out she was trapped she dared not reveal more than a passing curiosity about this heretic irulan felt it shed lost her famous bene gesserit poise and screamed in council weve lost the power to think well of ourselves even stilgar had been shocked javid had brought them back to their senses we dont have time for such nonsense javid was right what did it matter how they thought of themselves all that concerned them was holding onto the imperial power but irulan recovering her poise had been even more devastating weve lost something vital i tell you when we lost it we lost the ability to make good decisions we fall upon decisions these days the way we fall upon an enemy or wait and wait which is a form of giving up and we allow the decisions of others to move us have we forgotten that we were the ones who set this current flowing and all over the question of whether to accept a gift from house corrino irulan will have to be disposed of alia decided what was that old man down there waiting for he called himself a preacher why didnt he preach irulan was wrong about our decisionmaking alia told herself i can still make proper decisions the person with lifeanddeath decisions to make must make decisions or remain caught in the pendulum paul had always said that stasis was the most dangerous of those things which were not natural the only permanence was fluid change was all that mattered ill show them change alia thought the preacher raised his arms in benediction a few of those remaining in the square moved closer to him and alia noted the slowness of that movement yes the rumors were out that the preacher had aroused alias displeasure she bent closer to the ixian speaker beside her spy hole the speaker brought her the murmurings of the people in the square the sound of wind the scratching of feet on sand i bring you four messages the preacher said his voice blared from alias speaker and she turned down the volume each message is for a certain person the preacher said the first message is for alia the suzerain of this place he pointed behind him toward her spy hole i bring her a warning you who held the secret of duration in your loins have sold your future for an empty purse how dare he alia thought but his words froze her my second message the preacher said is for stilgar the fremen naib who believes he can translate the power of the tribes into the power of the imperium my warning to you stilgar the most dangerous of all creations is a rigid code of ethics it will turn upon you and drive you into exile he has gone too far alia thought i must send the guards for him no matter the consequences but her hands remained at her sides the preacher turned to face the temple climbed to the second step and once more whirled to face the square all the time keeping his left hand upon the shoulder of his guide he called out now my third message is for the princess irulan princess humiliation is a thing which no person can forget i warn you to flee whats he saying alia asked herself we humiliated irulan but why does he warn her to flee my decision was just made a thrill of fear shot through alia how did the preacher know my fourth message is for duncan idaho he shouted duncan you were taught to believe that loyalty buys loyalty ohh duncan do not believe in history because history is impelled by whatever passes for money duncan take your horns and do what you know best how to do alia chewed the back of her right hand horns she wanted to reach out and press the button which would summon guards but her hand refused to move now i will preach to you the preacher said this is a sermon of the desert i direct it to the ears of muaddibs priesthood those who practice the ecumenism of the sword ohhh you believers in manifest destiny know you not that manifest destiny has its demoniac side you cry out that you find yourselves exalted merely to have lived in the blessed generations of muaddib i say to you that you have abandoned muaddib holiness has replaced love in your religion you court the vengeance of the desert the preacher lowered his head as though in prayer alia felt herself shivering with awareness gods below that voice it had been cracked by years in the burning sands but it could be the remnant of pauls voice once more the preacher raised his head his voice boomed out over the square where more people had begun to gather attracted by this oddity out of the past thus it is written the preacher shouted they who pray for dew at the deserts edge shall bring forth the deluge they shall not escape their fate through powers of reason reason arises from pride that a man may not know in this way when he has done evil he lowered his voice it was said of muaddib that he died of prescience that knowledge of the future killed him and he passed from the universe of reality into the alam almythal i say to you that this is the illusion of maya such thoughts have no independent reality they can not go out from you and do real things muaddib said of himself that he possessed no rihani magic with which to encipher the universe do not doubt him again the preacher raised his arms lifted his voice in a stentorian bellow i warn the priesthood of muaddib the fire on the cliff shall burn you they who learn the lesson of selfdeception too well shall perish by that deception the blood of a brother can not be cleansed away he had lowered his arms found his young guide and was leaving the square before alia could break herself from the trembling immobility which had overcome her such fearless heresy it must be paul she had to warn her guards they dared not move against this preacher openly the evidence in the square below her confirmed this despite the heresy no one moved to stop the departing preacher no temple guard leaped to pursue him no pilgrim tried to stop him that charismatic blind man everyone who saw or heard him felt his power the reflection of divine talent in spite of the days heat alia felt suddenly cold she felt the thin edge of her grip on the imperium as a physical thing she gripped the edge of her spy hole window as though to hold her power thinking of its fragility the balance of landsraad choam and fremen arms held the core of power while spacing guild and bene gesserit dealt silently in the shadows the forbidden seepage of technological development which came from the edges of humankinds farthest migrations nibbled at the central power products permitted the ixian and tleilaxu factories could not relieve the pressure and always in the wings there stood faradn of house corrino inheritor of shaddam tvs titles and claims without the fremen without house atreides monopoly on the geriatric spice her grip would loosen all the power would dissolve she could feel it slipping from her right now people heeded this preacher it would be dangerous to silence him just as dangerous as it was to let him continue preaching such words as hed shouted across her square today she could see the first omens of her own defeat and the pattern of the problem stood out clearly in her mind the bene gesserits had codified the problem a large populace held in check by a small but powerful force is quite a common situation in our universe and we know the major conditions wherein this large populace may turn upon its keepers one when they find a leader this is the most volatile threat to the powerful they must retain control of leaders two when the populace recognizes its chains keep the populace blind and unquestioning three when the populace perceives a hope of escape from bondage they must never even believe that escape is possible alia shook her head feeling her cheeks tremble with the force of movement the signs were here in her populace every report she received from her spies throughout the imperium reinforced her certain knowledge unceasing warfare of the fremen jihad left its mark everywhere wherever the ecumenism of the sword had touched people retained the attitude of a subject population defensive concealing evasive all manifestations of authority and this meant essentially religious authority became subject to resentment oh pilgrims still came in their thronging millions and some among them were probably devout but for the most part pilgrimage had other motivations than devotion most often it was a canny surety for the future it emphasized obedience and gained a real form of power which was easily translated into wealth the hajji who returned from arrakis came home to new authority new social status the hajji could make profitable economic decisions which the planetbound of his homeworld dared not challenge alia knew the popular riddle what do you see inside the empty purse brought home from dune and the answer the eyes of muaddib fire diamonds the traditional ways to counter growing unrest paraded themselves before alias awareness people had to be taught that opposition was always punished and assistance to the ruler was always rewarded imperial forces must be shifted in random fashion major adjuncts to imperial power had to be concealed every movement by which the regency countered potential attack required delicate timing to keep the opposition off balance have i lost my sense of timing she wondered what idle speculation is this a voice within her asked she felt herself growing calmer yes the barons plan was a good one we eliminate the threat of the lady jessica and at the same time we discredit house corrino yes the preacher could be dealt with later she understood his posture the symbolism was clear he was the ancient spirit of unbridled speculation the spirit of heresy alive and functioning in her desert of orthodoxy that was his strength it didnt matter whether he was paul as long as that could be kept in doubt but her bene gesserit knowledge told alia that his strength would contain the key to his weakness the preacher has a flaw which we will find i will have him spied upon watched every moment and if the opportunity arises he will be discredited i will not argue with the fremen claims that they are divinely inspired to transmit a religious revelation it is their concurrent claim to ideological revelation which inspires me to shower them with derision of course they make the dual claim in the hope that it will strengthen their mandarinate and help them to endure in a universe which finds them increasingly oppressive it is in the name of all those oppressed people that i warn the fremen shortterm expediency always fails in the long term the preacher at arrakeen leto had come up in the night with stilgar to the narrow ledge at the crest of the low rock outcropping which sietch tabr called the attendant under the waning light of second moon the ledge gave them a panoramic view the shield wall with mount idaho to the north the great flat to the south and rolling dunes eastward toward habbanya ridge winding dust the aftermath of a storm hid the southern horizon moonlight frosted the rim of the shield wall stilgar had come against his will joining the secretive venture finally because leto aroused his curiosity why was it necessary to risk a sand crossing in the night the lad had threatened to sneak away and make the journey alone if stilgar refused the way of it bothered him profoundly though two such important targets alone in the night leto squatted on the ledge facing south toward the flat occasionally he pounded his knee as though in frustration stilgar waited he was good at silent waiting and stood two paces to one side of his charge arms folded his robe moving softly in the night breeze for leto the sand crossing represented a response to inner desperation a need to seek a new alignment for his life in a silent conflict which ghanima could no longer risk he had maneuvered stilgar into sharing the journey because there were things stilgar had to know in preparation for the days ahead again leto pounded his knee it was difficult to know a beginning he felt at times like an extension of those countless other lives all as real and immediate as his own in the flow of those lives there was no ending no accomplishment only eternal beginning they could be a mob too clamoring at him as though he were a single window through which each desired to peer and there lay the peril which had destroyed alia leto stared outward at the moonlight silvering the storm remnants folds and overfolds of dunes spread across the flat silica grit measured out by the winds mounded into waves pea sand grit sand pebbles he felt himself caught in one of those poised moments just before dawn time pressed at him it was already the month of akkad and behind him lay the last of an interminable waiting time long hot days and hot dry winds nights like this one tormented by gusts and endless blowings from the furnace lands of the hawkbled he glanced over his shoulder toward the shield wall a broken line in starlight beyond that wall in the northern sink lay the focus of his problems once more he looked to the desert as he stared into the hot darkness day dawned the sun rising out of dust scarves and placing a touch of lime into the storms red streamers he closed his eyes willing himself to see how this day would appear from arrakeen and the city lay there in his consciousness caught up like a scattering of boxes between the light and the new shadows desert boxes desert boxes when he opened his eyes the desert remained a spreading curry expanse of windkicked sand oily shadows along the base of each dune reached out like rays of the night just past they linked one time with the other he thought of the night squatting here with stilgar restless beside him the older man worried at the silence and the unexplained reasons for coming to this place stilgar must have many memories of passing this way with his beloved muaddib even now stilgar was moving scanning all around alert for dangers stilgar did not like the open in daylight he was pure old fremen in that letos mind was reluctant to leave the night and the clean exertions of a sand crossing once here in the rocks the night had taken on its black stillness he sympathized with stilgars daylight fears black was a single thing even when it contained boiling terrors light could be many things night held its fear smells and its things which came with slithering sounds dimensions separated in the night everything amplified thorns sharper blades more cutting but terrors of the day could be worse stilgar cleared his throat leto spoke without turning i have a very serious problem stil so i surmised the voice beside leto came low and wary the child had sounded disturbingly of the father it was a thing of forbidden magic which touched a cord of revulsion in stilgar fremen knew the terrors of possession those found possessed were rightfully killed and their water cast upon the sand lest it contaminate the tribal cistern the dead should remain dead it was correct to find ones immortality in children but children had no right to assume too exact a shape from their past my problem is that my father left so many things undone leto said especially the focus of our lives the empire can not go on this way stil without a proper focus for human life i am speaking of life you understand life not death once when he was troubled by a vision your father spoke in this vein to me stilgar said leto found himself tempted to pass off that questioning fear beside him with a light response perhaps a suggestion that they break their fast he realized that he was very hungry they had eaten the previous noon and leto had insisted on fasting through the night but another hunger drew him now the trouble with my life is the trouble with this place leto thought no preliminary creation i just go back and back and back until distances fade away i can not see the horizon i can not see habbanya ridge i cant find the original place of testing theres really no substitute for prescience leto said perhaps i should risk the spice and be destroyed as your father was a dilemma leto said once your father confided in me that knowing the future too well was to be locked into that future to the exclusion of any freedom to change the paradox which is our problem leto said its a subtle and powerful thing prescience the future becomes now to be sighted in the land of the blind carries its own perils if you try to interpret what you see for the blind you tend to forget that the blind possess an inherent movement conditioned by their blindness they are like a monstrous machine moving along its own path they have their own momentum their own fixations i fear the blind stil i fear them they can so easily crush anything in their path stilgar stared at the desert lime dawn had become steel day he said why have we come to this place because i wanted you to see the place where i may die stilgar tensed then so you have had a vision perhaps it was only a dream why do we come to such a dangerous place stilgar glared down at his charge we will return at once i wont die today stil no what was this vision i saw three paths leto said his voice came out with the sleepy sound of remembrance one of those futures requires me to kill our grandmother stilgar shot a sharp glance back toward sietch tabr as though he feared the lady jessica could hear them across the sandy distance why to keep from losing the spice monopoly i dont understand nor do i but that is the thought of my dream when i use the knife oh stilgar understood the use of a knife he drew a deep breath what is the second path ghani and i marry to seal the atreides bloodline ghaaa stilgar expelled his breath in a violent expression of distaste it was usual in ancient times for kings and queens to do this leto said ghani and i have decided we will not breed i warn you to hold fast in that decision there was death in stilgars voice by fremen law incest was punishable by death on the hanging tripod he cleared his throat asked and the third path i am called to reduce my father to human stature he was my friend muaddib stilgar muttered he was your god i must undeify him stilgar turned his back on the desert stared toward the oasis of his beloved sietch tabr such talk always disturbed him leto sensed the sweaty smell of stilgars movement it was such a temptation to avoid the purposeful things which had to be said here they could talk half the day away moving from the specific to the abstract as through drawn away from real decisions from those immediate necessities which confronted them and there was no doubt that house corrino posed a real threat to real lives his own and ghanis but everything he did now had to be weighed and tested against the secret necessities stilgar once had voted to have faradn assassinated holding out for the subtle application of chaumurky poison administered in a drink faradn was known to be partial to certain sweet liquors that could not be permitted if i die here stil leto said you must beware of alia she is no longer your friend what is this talk of death and your aunt now stilgar was truly outraged kill the lady jessica beware of alia die in this place small men change their faces at her command leto said a ruler need not be a prophet stil nor even godlike a ruler need only be sensitive i brought you here with me to clarify what our imperium requires it requires good government that does not depend upon laws or precedent but upon the personal qualities of whoever governs the regency handles its imperial duties quite well stilgar said when you come of age i am of age im the oldest person here youre a puling infant beside me i can remember times more than fifty centuries past hah i can even remember when we fremen were on thurgrod why do you play with such fancies stilgar demanded his tone peremptory leto nodded to himself why indeed why recount his memories of those other centuries todays fremen were his immediate problem most of them still only halftamed savages prone to laugh at unlucky innocence the crysknife dissolves at the death of its owner leto said muaddib has dissolved why are the fremen still alive it was one of those abrupt thought changes which so confounded stilgar he found himself temporarily dumb such words contained meaning but their intent eluded him i am expected to be emperor but i must be the servant leto said he glanced across his shoulder at stilgar my grandfather for whom i was named added new words to his coat of arms when he came here to dune here i am here i remain he had no choice stilgar said very good stil nor have i any choice i should be the emperor by birth by the fitness of my understanding by all that has gone into me i even know what the imperium requires good government naib has an ancient meaning stilgar said it is servant of the sietch i remember your training stil leto said for proper government the tribe must have ways to choose men whose lives reflect the way a government should behave from the depths of his fremen soul stilgar said youll assume the imperial mantle if its meet first you must prove that you can behave in the fashion of a ruler unexpectedly leto laughed then do you doubt my sincerity stil of course not my birthright you are who you are and if i do what is expected of me that is the measure of my sincerity eh it is the fremen practice then i can not have inner feelings to guide my behavior i dont understand what if i always behave with propriety no matter what it costs me to suppress my own desires then that is the measure of me such is the essence of selfcontrol youngster youngster leto shook his head ahhh stil you provide me with the key to a rational ethic of government i must be constant every action rooted in the traditions of the past that is proper but my past goes deeper than yours what difference i have no first person singular stil i am a multiple person with memories of traditions more ancient than you could imagine thats my burden stil im pastdirected im abrim with innate knowledge which resists newness and change yet muaddib changed all this he gestured at the desert his arm sweeping to encompass the shield wall behind him stilgar turned to peer at the shield wall a village had been built beneath the wall since muaddibs time houses to shelter a planetology crew helping spread plant life into the desert stilgar stared at the manmade intrusion into the landscape change yes there was an alignment to the village a trueness which offended him he stood silently ignoring the itching of grit particles under his stillsuit that village was an offense against the thing this planet had been suddenly stilgar wanted a circular howling of wind to leap over the dunes and obliterate that place the sensation left him trembling leto said have you noticed stil that the new stillsuits are of sloppy manufacture our water loss is too high stilgar stopped himself on the point of asking have i not said it instead he said our people grow increasingly dependent upon the pills leto nodded the pills shifted body temperature reduced water loss they were cheaper and easier than stillsuits but they inflicted the user with other burdens among them a tendency to slowed reaction time occasional blurred vision is that why we came out here stilgar asked to discuss stillsuit manufacture why not leto asked since you will not face what i must talk about why must i beware of your aunt anger edged his voice because she plays upon the old fremen desire to resist charge yet would bring more terrible change than you can imagine you make much out of little shes a proper fremen ahhh then the proper fremen holds to the ways of the past and i have an ancient past stil were i to give free reign to this inclination i would demand a closed society completely dependent upon the sacred ways of the past i would control migration explaining that this fosters new ideas and new ideas are a threat to the entire structure of life each little planetary polis would go its own way becoming what it would finally the empire would shatter under the weight of its differences stilgar tried to swallow in a dry throat these were words which muaddib might have produced they had his ring to them they were paradox frightening but if one allowed any change he shook his head the past may show the right way to behave if you live in the past stil but circumstances change stilgar could only agree that circumstances did change how must one behave then he looked beyond leto seeing the desert and not seeing it muaddib had walked there the flat was a place of golden shadows as the sun climbed purple shadows gritty rivulets crested in dust vapors the dust fog which usually hung over habbanya ridge was visible in the far distance now and the desert between presented his eyes with dunes diminishing one curve into another through the smoky shimmer of heat he saw the plants which crept out from the desert edge muaddib had caused life to sprout in that desolate place copper gold red flowers yellow flowers rust and russet greygreen leaves spikes and harsh shadows beneath bushes the motion of the days heat set shadows quivering vibrating in the air presently stilgar said i am only a leader of fremen you are the son of a duke not knowing what you said you said it leto said stilgar scowled once long ago muaddib had chided him thus you remember it dont you stil leto asked we were under habbanya ridge and the sardaukar captain remember him aramsham he killed his friend to save himself and you warned several times that day about preserving the lives of sardaukar whod seen our secret ways finally you said they would surely reveal what theyd seen they must be killed and my father said not knowing what you said you said it and you were hurt you told him you were only a simple leader of fremen dukes must know more important things stilgar stared down at leto we were under habbanya ridge we this this child not even conceived on that day knew what had taken place in exact detail the kind of detail which could only be known to someone who had been there it was only another proof that these atreides children could not be judged by ordinary standards now you will listen to me leto said if i die or disappear in the desert you are to flee from sietch tabr i command it you are to take ghani and you are not yet my duke youre a a child im an adult in a childs flesh leto said he pointed down to a narrow crack in the rocks below them if i die here it will be in that place you will see the blood you will know then take my sister and im doubling your guard stilgar said youre not coming out here again we are leaving now and you stil you can not hold me turn your mind once more to that time at habbanya ridge remember the factory crawler was out there on the sand and a big maker was coming there was no way to save the crawler from the worm and my father was annoyed that he couldnt save that crawler but gurney could think only of the men hed lost in the sand remember what he said your father wouldve been more concerned for the men he couldnt save stil i charge you to save people theyre more important than things and ghani is the most precious of all because without me she is the only hope for the atreides i will hear no more stilgar said he turned and began climbing down the rocks toward the oasis across the sand he heard leto following presently leto passed him and glancing back said have you noticed stil how beautiful the young women are this year the life of a single human as the life of a family or an entire people persists as memory my people must come to see this as part of their maturing process they are people as organism and in this persistent memory they store more and more experiences in a subliminal reservoir humankind hopes to call upon this material if it is needed for a changing universe but much that is stored can be lost in that chance play of accident which we call fate much may not be integrated into evolutionary relationships and thus may not be evaluated and keyed into activity by those ongoing environmental changes which inflict themselves upon flesh the species can forget this is the special value of the kwisatz haderach which the bene gesserits never suspected the kwisatz haderach can not forget the book of leto after harq alada stilgar could not explain it but he found letos casual observation profoundly disturbing it ground through his awareness all the way back across the sand to sietch tabr taking precedence over everything else leto had said out there on the attendant indeed the young women of arrakis were very beautiful that year and the young men too their faces glowed serenely with waterrichness their eyes looked outward and far they exposed their features often without any pretense of stillsuit masks and the snaking lines of catchtubes frequently they did not even wear stillsuits in the open preferring the new garments which as they moved offered flickering suggestions of the lithe young bodies beneath such human beauty was set off against the new beauty of the landscape by contrast with the old arrakis the eye could be spellbound by its collision with a tiny clump of green twigs growing among redbrown rocks and the old sietch warrens of the cavemetropolis culture complete with elaborate seals and moisture traps at every entrance were giving way to open villages built often of mud bricks mud bricks why did i want the village destroyed stilgar wondered and he stumbled as he walked he knew himself to be of a dying breed old fremen gasped in wonder at the prodigality of their planet water wasted into the air for no more than its ability to mold building bricks the water for a single onefamily dwelling would keep an entire sietch alive for a year the new buildings even had transparent windows to let in the suns heat and to desiccate the bodies within such windows opened outward new fremen within their mud homes could look out upon their landscape they no longer were enclosed and huddling in a sietch where the new vision moved there also moved the imagination stilgar could feel this the new vision joined fremen to the rest of the imperial universe conditioned them to unbounded space once theyd been tied to waterpoor arrakis by their enslavement to its bitter necessities theyd not shared that openmindedness which conditioned inhabitants on most planets of the imperium stilgar could see the changes contrasting with his own doubts and fears in the old days it had been a rare fremen who even considered the possibility that he might leave arrakis to begin a new life on one of the waterrich worlds theyd not even been permitted the dream of escape he watched letos moving back as the youth walked ahead leto had spoken of prohibitions against movement offplanet well that had always been a reality for most otherworlders even where the dream was permitted as a safety valve but planetary serfdom had reached its peak here on arrakis fremen had turned inward barricaded in their minds as they were barricaded in their cave warrens the very meaning of sietch a place of sanctuary in times of trouble had been perverted here into a monstrous confinement for an entire population leto spoke the truth muaddib had changed all that stilgar felt lost he could feel his old beliefs crumbling the new outward vision produced life which desired to move away from containment how beautiful the young women are this year the old ways my ways he admitted had forced his people to ignore all history except that which turned inward onto their own travail the old fremen had read history out of their own terrible migrations their flights from persecution into persecution the old planetary government had followed the stated policy of the old imperium they had suppressed creativity and all sense of progress of evolution prosperity had been dangerous to the old imperium and its holders of power with an abrupt shock stilgar realized that these things were equally dangerous to the course which alia was setting again stilgar stumbled and fell farther behind leto in the old ways and old religions thered been no future only an endless now before muaddib stilgar saw the fremen had been conditioned to believe in failure never in the possibility of accomplishment well theyd believed lietkynes but hed set a fortygeneration timescale that was no accomplishment that was a dream which he saw now had also turned inward muaddib had changed that during the jihad fremen had learned much about the old padishah emperor shaddam iv the eightyfirst padishah of house corrino to occupy the golden lion throne and reign over this imperium of uncounted worlds had used arrakis as a testing place for those policies which he hoped to implement in the rest of his empire his planetary governors on arrakis had cultivated a persistent pessimism to bolster their power base theyd made sure that everyone on arrakis even the freeroaming fremen became familiar with numerous cases of injustice and insoluble problems they had been taught to think of themselves as a helpless people for whom there was no succor how beautiful the young women are this year as he watched letos retreating back stilgar began to wonder how the youth had set these thoughts flowing and just by uttering a seemingly simple statement because of that statement stilgar found himself viewing alia and his own role on the council in an entirely different way alia was fond of saying that old ways gave ground slowly stilgar admitted to himself that hed always found this statement vaguely reassuring change was dangerous invention must be suppressed individual willpower must be denied what other function did the priesthood serve than to deny individual will alia kept saying that opportunities for open competition had to be reduced to manageable limits but that meant the recurrent threat of technology could only be used to confine populations just as it had served its ancient masters any permitted technology had to be rooted in ritual otherwise otherwise again stilgar stumbled he was at the qanat now and saw leto waiting beneath the apricot orchard which grew along the flowing water stilgar heard his feet moving through uncut grass uncut grass what can i believe stilgar asked himself it was proper for a fremen of his generation to believe that individuals needed a profound sense of their own limitations traditions were surely the most controlling element in a secure society people had to know the boundaries of their time of their society of their territory what was wrong with the sietch as a model for all thinking a sense of enclosure should pervade every individual choice should fence in the family the community and every step taken by a proper government stilgar came to a stop and stared across the orchard at leto the youth stood there regarding him with a smile does he know the turmoil in my head stilgar wondered and the old fremen naib tried to fall back on the traditional catechism of his people each aspect of life required a single form its inherent circularity based on secret inner knowledge of what will work and what will not work the model for life for the community for every element of the larger society right up to and beyond the peaks of government that model had to be the sietch and its counterpart in the sand shaihulud the giant sandworm was surely a most formidable creature but when threatened it hid in the impenetrable deeps change is dangerous stilgar told himself sameness and stability were the proper goals of government but the young men and women were beautiful and they remembered the words of muaddib as he deposed shaddam iv its not long life to the emperor that i seek its long life to the imperium isnt that what ive been saying to myself stilgar wondered he resumed walking headed toward the sietch entrance slightly to letos right the youth moved to intercept him muaddib had said another thing stilgar reminded himself just as individuals are born mature breed and die so do societies and civilizations and governments dangerous or not there would be change the beautiful young fremen knew this they could look outward and see it prepare for it stilgar was forced to stop it was either that or walk right over leto the youth peered up at him owlishly said you see stil tradition isnt the absolute guide you thought it was a fremen dies when he is too long from the desert this we call the water sickness stilgar the commentaries it is difficult for me asking you to do this alia said but i must insure that theres an empire for pauls children to inherit theres no other reason for the regency alia turned from where she was seated at a mirror completing her morning toilet she looked at her husband measuring how he absorbed these words duncan idaho deserved careful study in these moments there was no doubt that hed become something far more subtle and dangerous than the onetime swordmaster of house atreides the outer appearance remained similar the black goat hair over sharp dark features but in the long years since his awakening from the ghola state he had undergone an inner metamorphosis she wondered now as she had wondered many times what the ghola rebirthafterdeath might have hidden in the secret loneliness of him before the tleilaxu had worked their subtle science on him duncans reactions had borne clear labels for the atreides loyalty fanatic adherence to the moral code of his mercenary forebears swift to anger and swift to recover he had been implacable in his resolve for revenge against house harkonnen and he had died saving paul but the tleilaxu had bought his body from the sardaukar and in their regeneration vats they had grown a zombiekatrundo the flesh of duncan idaho but none of his conscious memories hed been trained as a mentat and sent as a gift a human computer for paul a fine tool equipped with a hypnotic compulsion to slay his owner the flesh of duncan idaho had resisted that compulsion and in the intolerable stress his cellular past had come back to him alia had decided long ago that it was dangerous to think of him as duncan in the privacy of her thoughts better to think of him by his ghola name hayt far better and it was essential that he get not the slightest glimpse of the old baron harkonnen sitting there in her mind duncan saw alia studying him turned away love could not hide the changes in her nor conceal from him the transparency of her motives the manyfaceted metal eyes which the tleilaxu had given him were cruel in their ability to penetrate deception they limned her now as a gloating almost masculine figure and he could not stand to see her thus why do you turn away alia asked i must think about this thing he said the lady jessica is an atreides and your loyalty is to house atreides not to me alia pouted dont put such fickle interpretations into me he said alia pursed her lips had she moved too rapidly duncan crossed to the chambered opening which looked down on a corner of the temple plaza he could see pilgrims beginning to gather there the arrakeen traders moving in to feed on the edges like a pack of predators upon a herd of beasts he focused on a particular group of tradesmen spicefiber baskets over their arms fremen mercenaries a pace behind them they moved with a stolid force through the gathering throng they sell pieces of etched marble he said pointing did you know that they set the pieces out in the desert to be etched by stormsands sometimes they find interesting patterns in the stone they call it a new art form very popular genuine stormetched marble from dune i bought a piece of it last week a golden tree with five tassels lovely but very fragile dont change the subject alia said i havent changed the subject he said its beautiful but its not art humans create art by their own violence by their own volition he put his right hand on the windowsill the twins detest this city and im afraid i see their point i fail to see the association alia said the abduction of my mother is not a real abduction she will be safe as your captive this city was built by the blind he said did you know that leto and stilgar went out from sietch tabr into the desert last week they were gone the whole night it was reported to me she said these baubles from the sand would you have me prohibit their sale thatd be bad for business he said turning do you know what stilgar said when i asked why they went out on the sand that way he said leto wished to commune with the spirit of muaddib alia felt the sudden coldness of panic looked in the mirror a moment to recover leto would not venture from the sietch at night for such nonsense was it a conspiracy idaho put a hand over his eyes to blot out the sight of her said stilgar told me he went along with leto because he still believes in muaddib of course he does idaho chuckled a hollow sound he said he still believes because muaddib was always for the little people what did you say to that alia asked her voice betraying her fear idaho dropped his hand from his eyes i said that must make you one of the little people duncan thats a dangerous game bait that fremen naib and you could awaken a beast to destroy us all he still believes in muaddib idaho said thats our protection what was his reply he said he knew his own mind i see no i dont believe you do things that bite have longer teeth than stilgars i dont understand you today duncan i ask you to do a very important thing a thing vital to what is all of this rambling how petulant she sounded he turned back to the chambered window when i was trained as a mentat it is very difficult alia to learn how to work your own mind you learn first that the mind must be allowed to work itself thats very strange you can work your own muscles exercise them strengthen them but the mind acts of itself sometimes when you have learned this about the mind it shows you things you do not want to see and thats why you tried to insult stilgar stilgar doesnt know his own mind he doesnt let it run free except in the spice orgy not even there thats what makes him a naib to be a leader of men he controls and limits his reactions he does what is expected of him once you know this you know stilgar and you can measure the length of his teeth thats the fremen way she said well duncan will you do it or wont you she must be taken and it must be made to look like the work of house corrino he remained silent weighing her tone and arguments in his mentat way this abduction plan spoke of a coldness and a cruelty whose dimensions thus revealed shocked him risk her own mothers life for the reasons thus far produced alia was lying perhaps the whisperings about alia and javid were true this thought produced an icy hardness in his stomach youre the only one i can trust for this alia said i know that he said she took this as acceptance smiled at herself in the mirror you know idaho said the mentat learns to look at every human as a series of relationships alia did not respond she sat caught in a personal memory which drew a blank expression on her face idaho glancing over his shoulder at her saw the expression and shuddered it was as though she communed with voices heard only by herself relationships he whispered and he thought one must cast off old agonies as a snake casts off its skin only to grow a new set and accept all of their limitations it was the same with governments even the regency old governments can be traced like discarded molts i must carry out this scheme but not in the way alia commands presently alia shook her shoulders said leto should not be going out like that in these times i will reprimand him not even with stilgar not even with him she arose from her mirror crossed to where idaho stood beside the window put a hand on his arm he repressed a shiver reduced this reaction to a mentat computation something in her revolted him something in her he could not bring himself to look at her he smelled the melange of her cosmetics cleared his throat she said i will be busy today examining faradns gifts the clothing yes nothing he does is what it seems and we must remember that his bashar tyekanik is an adept of chaumurky chaumas and all the other subtleties of royal assassination the price of power he said pulling away from her but were still mobile and faradn is not she studied his chiseled profile sometimes the workings of his mind were difficult to fathom was he thinking only that freedom of action gave life to a military power well life on arrakis had been too secure for too long senses once whetted by omnipresent dangers could degenerate when not used yes she said we still have the fremen mobility he repeated we can not degenerate into infantry thatd be foolish his tone annoyed her and she said faradn will use any means to destroy us ahhh thats it he said thats a form of initiative a mobility which we didnt have in the old days we had a code the code of house atreides we always paid our way and let the enemy be the pillagers that restriction no longer holds of course were equally mobile house atreides and house corrino we abduct my mother to save her from harm as much as for any other reason alia said we still live by the code he looked down at her she knew the dangers of inciting a mentat to compute didnt she realize what he had computed yet he still loved her he brushed a hand across his eyes how youthful she looked the lady jessica was correct alia gave the appearance of not having aged a day in their years together she still possessed the soft features of her bene gesserit mother but her eyes were atreides measuring demanding hawklike and now something possessed of cruel calculation lurked behind those eyes idaho had served house atreides for too many years not to understand the familys strengths as well as their weaknesses but this thing in alia this was new the atreides might play a devious game against enemies but never against friends and allies and not at all against family it was ground into the atreides manner support your own populace to the best of your ability show them how much better they lived under the atreides demonstrate your love for your friends by the candor of your behavior with them what alia asked now though was not atreides he felt this with all of his bodys flesh and nerve structure he was a unit indivisible feeling this alien attitude in alia abruptly his mentat sensorium clicked into full awareness and his mind leaped into the frozen trance where time did not exist only the computation existed alia would recognize what had happened to him but that could not be helped he gave himself up to the computation computation a reflected lady jessica lived out a pseudolife in alias awareness he saw this as he saw the reflected preghola duncan idaho which remained a constant in his own awareness alia had this awareness by being one of the preborn he had it out of the tleilaxu regeneration tanks yet alia denied that reflection risked her mothers life therefore alia was not in contact with that pseudojessica within therefore alia was completely possessed by another pseudolife to the exclusion of all others possessed alien abomination mentat fashion he accepted this turned to other facets of his problem all of the atreides were on this one planet would house corrino risk attack from space his mind flashed through the review of those conventions which had ended primitive forms of warfare one all planets were vulnerable to attack from space ergo retaliation revenge facilities were set up offplanet by every house major faradn would know that the atreides had not omitted this elementary precaution two force shields were a complete defense against projectiles and explosives of nonatomic type the basic reason why handtohand conflict had reentered human combat but infantry had its limits house corrino might have brought their sardaukar back to a prearrakeen edge but they still could be no match for the abandoned ferocity of fremen three planetary feudalism remained in constant danger from a large technical class but the effects of the butlerian jihad continued as a damper on technological excesses ixians tleilaxu and a few scattered outer planets were the only possible threat in this regard and they were planetvulnerable to the combined wrath of the rest of the imperium the butlerian jihad would not be undone mechanized warfare required a large technical class the atreides imperium had channeled this force into other pursuits no large technical class existed unwatched and the empire remained safely feudalist naturally since that was the best social form for spreading over widely dispersed wild frontiers new planets duncan felt his mentat awareness coruscate as it shot through memory data of itself completely impervious to the passage of time arriving at the conviction that house corrino would not risk an illegal atomic attack he did this in flashcomputation the main decisional pathway but he was perfectly aware of the elements which went into this conviction the imperium commanded as many nuclear and allied weapons as all the great houses combined at least half the great houses would react without thinking if house corrino broke the convention the atreides offplanet retaliation system would be joined by overwhelming force and no need to summon any of them fear would do the calling salusa secundus and its allies would vanish in hot clouds house corrino would not risk such a holocaust they were undoubtedly sincere in subscribing to the argument that nuclear weapons were a reserve held for one purpose defense of humankind should a threatening other intelligence ever be encountered the computational thoughts had clean edges sharp relief there were no blurred betweenplaces alia chose abduction and terror because she had become alien nonatreides house corrino was a threat but not in the ways which alia argued in council alia wanted the lady jessica removed because that searing bene gesserit intelligence had seen what only now had become clear to him idaho shook himself out of the mentat trance saw alia standing in front of him a coldly measuring expression on her face wouldnt you rather the lady jessica were killed he asked the alienflash of her joy lay exposed before his eyes for a brief instant before being covered by false outrage duncan yes this alienalia preferred matricide you are afraid of your mother not for her he said she spoke without a change in her measuring stare of course i am she has reported about me to the sisterhood what do you mean dont you know the greatest temptation for a bene gesserit she moved closer to him seductive looked upward at him through her lashes i thought only to keep myself strong and alert for the sake of the twins you speak of temptation he said his voice mentatflat its the thing which the sisterhood hides most deeply the thing they most fear its why they call me abomination they know their inhibitions wont hold me back temptation they always speak with heavy emphasis great temptation you see we who employ the bene gesserit teachings can influence such things as the internal adjustment of enzyme balance within our bodies it can prolong youth far longer than with melange do you see the consequences should many bene gesserits do this it would be noticed im sure you compute the accuracy of what im saying melange is what makes us the target for so many plots we control a substance which prolongs life what if it became known that bene gesserits controlled an even more potent secret you see not one reverend mother would be safe abduction and torture of bene gesserits would become a most common activity youve accomplished this enzyme balancing it was a statement not a question ive defied the sisterhood my mothers reports to the sisterhood will make the bene gesserits unswerving allies of house corrino how very plausible he thought he tested but surely your own mother would not turn against you she was bene gesserit long before she was my mother duncan she permitted her own son my brother to undergo the test of the gom jabbar she arranged it and she knew he might not survive it bene gesserits have always been short on faith and long on pragmatism shell act against me if she believes its in the best interests of the sisterhood he nodded how convincing she was it was a sad thought we must hold the initiative she said thats our sharpest weapon theres the problem of gurney halleck he said do i have to kill my old friend gurneys off on some spy errand in the desert she said knowing idaho already was aware of this hes safely out of the way very odd he said the regent governor of caladan running errands here on arrakis why not alia demanded hes her lover in his dreams if not in fact yes of course and he wondered that she did not hear the insincerity in his voice when will you abduct her alia asked its better that you dont know yes yes i see wherell you take her where she can not be found depend upon it she wont be left here to threaten you the glee in alias eyes could not be mistaken but where will if you do not know then you can answer before a truthsayer if necessary that you do not know where she is ahhh clever duncan now she believes i will kill the lady jessica he thought and he said goodbye beloved she did not hear the finality in his voice even kissed him lightly as he left and all the way down through the sietchlike maze of temple corridors idaho brushed at his eyes tleilaxu eyes were not immune to tears you have loved caladan and lamented its lost host but pain discovers new lovers can not erase those forever ghost refrain from the habbanya lament stilgar quadrupled the sietch guard around the twins but he knew it was useless the lad was like his atreides namesake the grandfather leto everyone whod known the original duke remarked on it leto had the measuring look about him and caution yes but all of it had to be evaluated against that latent wildness the susceptibility to dangerous decisions ghanima was more like her mother there was chanis red hair the set of chanis eyes and a calculating way about her when she adjusted to difficulties she often said that she only did what she had to do but where leto led she would follow and leto was going to lead them into danger not once did stilgar think of taking his problem to alia that ruled out irulan who ran to alia with anything and everything in coming to his decision stilgar realized he had accepted the possibility that leto judged alia correctly she uses people in a casual and callous way he thought she even uses duncan that way it isnt so much that shed turn on me and kill me shed discard me meanwhile the guard was strengthened and stilgar stalked his sietch like a robed specter prying everywhere all the time his mind seethed with the doubts leto had planted there if one could not depend upon tradition then where was the rock upon which to anchor his life on the afternoon of the convocation of welcome for the lady jessica stilgar spied ghanima standing with her grandmother at the entrance lip to the sietchs great assembly chamber it was early and alia had not yet arrived but people already were thronging into the chamber casting surreptitious glances at the child and adult as they passed stilgar paused in a shadowed alcove out of the crowd flow and watched the pair of them unable to hear their words above the murmuring throb of an assembling multitude the people of many tribes would be here today to welcome back their old reverend mother but he stared at ghanima her eyes the way they danced when she spoke the movement fascinated him those deep blue steady demanding measuring eyes and that way of throwing her redgold hair off her shoulder with a twist of the head that was chani it was a ghostly resurrection an uncanny resemblance slowly stilgar drew closer and took up his station in another alcove he could not associate ghanimas observing manner with any other child of his experience except her brother where was leto stilgar glanced back up the crowded passage his guards would have spread an alarm if anything were amiss he shook his head these twins assaulted his sanity they were a constant abrasion against his peace of mind he could almost hate them kin were not immune from ones hatred but blood and its precious water carried demands for ones countenance which transcended most other concerns these twins existed as his greatest responsibility dustfiltered brown light came from the cavernous assembly chamber beyond ghanima and jessica it touched the childs shoulders and the new white robe she wore backlighting her hair as she turned to peer into the passage at the people thronging past why did leto afflict me with these doubts he wondered there was no doubt that it had been done deliberately perhaps leto wanted me to have a small share of his own mental experience stilgar knew why the twins were different but had always found his reasoning processes unable to accept what he knew he had never experienced the womb as prison to an awakened consciousness a living awareness from the second month of gestation so it was said leto had once said that his memory was like an internal holograph expanding in size and in detail from that original shocked awakening but never changing shape or outline for the first time as he watched ghanima and the lady jessica stilgar began to understand what it must be like to live in such a scrambled web of memories unable to retreat or find a sealed room of the mind faced with such a condition one had to integrate madness to select and reject from a multitude of offerings in a system where answers changed as fast as the question there could be no fixed tradition there could be no absolute answers to doublefaced questions what works that which does not work what does not work that which works he recognized this pattern it was the old fremen game of riddles question it brings death and life answer the coriolis wind why did leto want me to understand this stilgar asked himself from his cautious probings stilgar knew that the twins shared a common view of their difference they thought of it as affliction the birth canal would be a draining place to such a one he thought ignorance reduces the shock of some experiences but they would have no ignorance about birth what would it be like to live a life where you knew all of the things that could go wrong you would face a constant war with doubts you would resent your difference from your fellows it would be pleasant to inflict others with even a taste of that difference why me would be your first unanswered question and what have i been asking myself stilgar thought a wry smile touched his lips why me seeing the twins in this new way he understood the dangerous chances they took with their uncompleted bodies ghanima had put it to him succinctly once after hed berated her for climbing the precipitous west face to the rim above sietch tabr why should i fear death ive been there before many times how can i presume to teach such children stilgar wondered how can anyone presume oddly jessicas thoughts were moving in a similar vein as she talked to her granddaughter shed been thinking how difficult it must be to carry mature minds in immature bodies the body would have to learn what the mind already knew it could do aligning responses and reflexes the old bene gesserit pranabindu regimen would be available to them but even there the mind would run where the flesh could not gurney had a supremely difficult task carrying out her orders stilgar is watching us from an alcove back there ghanima said jessica did not turn but she found herself confounded by what she heard in ghanimas voice ghanima loved the old fremen as one would love a parent even while she spoke lightly of him and teased him she loved him the realization forced jessica to see the old naib in a new light understanding in a gestalten revelation what the twins and stilgar shared this new arrakis did not fit stilgar well jessica realized no more than this new universe fitted her grandchildren unwanted and undemanded a bene gesserit saying flowed through jessicas mind to suspect your own mortality is to know the beginning of terror to learn irrefutably that you are mortal is to know the end of terror yes death would not be a hard yoke to wear but life was a slow fire to stilgar and the twins each found an ill fitting world and longed for other ways where variations might be known without threat they were children of abraham learning more from a hawk stooping over the desert than from any book yet written leto had confounded jessica only that morning as theyd stood beside the qanat which flowed below the sietch hed said water traps us grandmother wed be better off living like dust because then the wind could carry us higher than the highest cliffs of the shield wall although she was familiar with such devious maturity from the mouths of these children jessica had been caught by this utterance but had managed your father mightve said that and leto throwing a handful of sand into the air to watch it fall yes he mightve but my father did not consider then how quickly water makes everything fall back to the ground from which it came now standing beside ghanima in the sietch jessica felt the shock of those words anew she turned glanced back at the stillflowing throng let her gaze wander across stilgars shadowy shape in the alcove stilgar was no tame fremen trained only to carry twigs to the nest he was still a hawk when he thought of the color red he did not think of flowers but of blood youre so quiet suddenly ghanima said is something wrong jessica shook her head its something leto said this morning thats all when you went out to the plantings whatd he say jessica thought of the curious look of adult wisdom which had come over letos face out there in the morning it was the same look which came over ghanimas face right now he was recalling the time when gurney came back from the smugglers to the atreides banner jessica said then you were talking about stilgar ghanima said jessica did not question how this insight occurred the twins appeared capable of reproducing each others thought trains at will yes we were jessica said stilgar didnt like to hear gurney calling paul his duke but gurneys presence forced this upon all of the fremen gurney kept saying my duke i see ghanima said and of course leto observed that he was not yet stilgars duke thats right you know what he was doing to you of course ghanima said im not sure i do jessica admitted and she found this admission particularly disturbing because it had not occurred to her that leto was doing anything at all to her he was trying to ignite your memories of our father ghanima said letos always hungry to know our father from the viewpoints of others who knew him but doesnt leto have oh he can listen to the inner life certainly but thats not the same you spoke about him of course our father i mean you spoke of him as your son yes jessica clipped it off she did not like the feeling that these twins could turn her on and off at will open her memories for observation touch any emotion which attracted their interest ghanima might be doing that right now leto said something to disturb you ghanima said jessica found herself shocked at the necessity to suppress anger yes he did you dont like the fact that he knows our father as our mother knew him and knows our mother as our father knew her ghanima said you dont like what that implies what we may know about you id never really thought about it that way before jessica said finding her voice stiff its the knowledge of sensual things which usually disturbs ghanima said its your conditioning you find it extremely difficult to think of us as anything but children but theres nothing our parents did together in public or in private that we would not know for a brief instant jessica found herself returning to the reaction which had come over her out there beside the qanat but now she focused that reaction upon ghanima he probably spoke of your dukes rutting sensuality ghanima said sometimes leto needs a bridle on his mouth is there nothing these twins can not profane jessica wondered moving from shock to outrage to revulsion how dared they speak of her letos sensuality of course a man and woman who loved each other would share the pleasure of their bodies it was a private and beautiful thing not to be paraded in casual conversation between a child and an adult child and adult abruptly jessica realized that neither leto nor ghanima had done this casually as jessica remained silent ghanima said weve shocked you i apologize for both of us knowing leto i know he didnt consider apologizing sometimes when hes following a particular scent he forgets how different we are from you for instance jessica thought and that is why you both do this of course you are teaching me and she wondered then who else are you teaching stilgar duncan leto tries to see things as you see them ghanima said memories are not enough when you try the hardest just then you most often fail jessica sighed ghanima touched her grandmothers arm your son left many things unsaid which yet must be said even to you forgive us but he loved you dont you know that jessica turned away to hide the tears glistening in her eyes he knew your fears ghanima said just as he knew stilgars fears dear stil our father was his doctor of beasts and stil was no more than the green snail hidden in its shell she hummed the tune from which shed taken these words the music hurled the lyrics against jessicas awareness without compromise o doctor of beasts to a green snail shell with its timid miracle hidden awaiting death you come as a deity even snails know that gods obliterate and cures bring pain that heaven is seen through a door of flame o doctor of beasts i am the mansnail who sees your single eye peering into my shell why muaddib why ghanima said unfortunately our father left many mansnails in our universe the assumption that humans exist within an essentially impermanent universe taken as an operational precept demands that the intellect become a totally aware balancing instrument but the intellect can not react thus without involving the entire organism such an organism may be recognized by its burning driving behavior and thus it is with a society treated as organism but here we encounter an old inertia societies move to the goading of ancient reactive impulses they demand permanence any attempt to display the universe of impermanence arouses rejection patterns fear anger and despair then how do we explain the acceptance of prescience simply the giver of prescient visions because he speaks of an absolute permanent realization may be greeted with joy by humankind even while predicting the most dire events the book of leto after harq alada its liking fighting in the dark alia said she paced the council chamber in angry strides moving from the tall silvery draperies which softened the morning sun at the eastern windows to the divans grouped beneath decorated wall panels at the rooms opposite end her sandals crossed spicefiber rugs parquet wood tiles of giant garnet and once more rugs at last she stood over irulan and idaho who sat facing each other on divans of grey whale fur idaho had resisted returning from tabr but she had sent peremptory orders the abduction of jessica was more important than ever now but it had to wait idahos mentat perceptions were required these things are cut from the same pattern alia said they stink of a farreaching plot perhaps not irulan ventured but she glanced questioningly at idaho alias face lapsed into an undisguised sneer how could irulan be that innocent unless alia bent a sharp and questioning stare onto the princess irulan wore a simple black aba robe which matched the shadows in her spiceindigo eyes her blonde hair was tied in a tight coil at the nape of her neck accenting a face thinned and toughened by years on arrakis she still retained the haughtiness shed learned in the court of her father shaddam iv and alia often felt that this prideful attitude could mask the thoughts of a conspirator idaho lounged in the blackandgreen uniform of an atreides house guard no insignia it was an affectation which was secretly resented by many of alias actual guards especially the amazons who gloried in insignia of office they did not like the plain presence of the gholaswordmastermentat the more so because he was the husband of their mistress so the tribes want the lady jessica reinstated into the regency council idaho said how can that they make unanimous demand alia said pointing to an embossed sheet of spicepaper on the divan beside irulan faradn is one thing but this this has the stink of other alignments what does stilgar think irulan asked his signatures on that paper alia said but if he how could he deny the mother of his god alia sneered idaho looked up at her thinking thats awfully close to the edge with irulan again he wondered why alia had brought him back here when she knew that he was needed at sietch tabr if the abduction plot were to be carried off was it possible shed heard about the message sent to him by the preacher this thought filled his breast with turmoil how could that mendicant mystic know the secret signal by which paul atreides had always summoned his swordmaster idaho longed to leave this pointless meeting and return to the search for an answer to that question theres no doubt that the preacher has been offplanet alia said the guild wouldnt dare deceive us in such a thing i will have him careful irulan said indeed have a care idaho said half the planet believe him to be he shrugged your brother and idaho hoped he had carried this off with a properly casual attitude how had the man known that signal but if hes a courier or a spy of the hes made contact with no one from choam or house corrino irulan said we can be sure of we can be sure of nothing alia did not try to hide her scorn she turned her back on irulan faced idaho he knew why he was here why didnt he perform as expected he was in council because irulan was here the history which had brought a princess of house corrino into the atreides fold could never be forgotten allegiance once changed could change again duncans mentat powers should be searching for flaws for subtle deviations in irulans behavior idaho stirred glanced at irulan there were times when he resented the straightline necessities imposed on mentat performance he knew what alia was thinking irulan would know it as well but this princesswife to paul muaddib had overcome the decisions which had made her less than the royal concubine chani there could be no doubt of irulans devotion to the royal twins she had renounced family and bene gesserit in dedication to the atreides my mother is part of this plot alia insisted for what other reason would the sisterhood send her back here at a time such as this hysteria isnt going to help us idaho said alia whirled away from him as hed known she would it helped him that he did not have to look at that oncebeloved face which was now so twisted by alien possession well irulan said the guild cant be completely trusted for the guild alia sneered we cant rule out the enmity of the guild or the bene gesserit idaho said but we must assign them special categories as essentially passive combatants the guild will live up to its basic rule never govern theyre a parasitic growth and they know it they wont do anything to kill the organism which keeps them alive their idea of which organism keeps them alive may be different from ours irulan drawled it was the closest she ever came to a sneer that lazy tone of voice which said you missed a point mentat alia appeared puzzled she had not expected irulan to take this tack it was not the kind of view which a conspirator would want examined no doubt idaho said but the guild wont come out overtly against house atreides the sisterhood on the other hand might risk a certain kind of political break which if they do itll be through a front someone or some group they can disavow irulan said the bene gesserit havent existed all of these centuries without knowing the value of selfeffacement they prefer being behind the throne not on it selfeffacement alia wondered was that irulans choice precisely the point i make about the guild idaho said he found the necessities of argument and explanation helpful they kept his mind from other problems alia strode back toward the sunlit windows she knew idahos blind spot every mentat had it they had to make pronouncements this brought about a tendency to depend upon absolutes to see finite limits they knew this about themselves it was part of their training yet they continued to act beyond selflimiting parameters i shouldve left him at sietch tabr alia thought it wouldve been better to just turn irulan over to javid for questioning within her skull alia heard a rumbling voice exactly shut up shut up shut up she thought a dangerous mistake beckoned her in these moments and she could not recognize its outlines all she could sense was the danger idaho had to help her out of this predicament he was a mentat mentats were necessary the humancomputer replaced the mechanical devices destroyed by the butlerian jihad thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind but alia longed now for a compliant machine they could not have suffered from idahos limitations you could never distrust a machine alia heard irulans drawling voice a feint within a feint within a feint within a feint irulan said we all know the accepted pattern of attack upon power i dont blame alia for her suspicions of course she suspects everyone even us ignore that for the moment though what remains as the prime arena of motives the most fertile source of danger to the regency choam idaho said his voice mentatflat alia allowed herself a grim smile the combine honnete ober advancer mercantiles but house atreides dominated choam with fiftyone percent of its shares the priesthood of muaddib held another five percent pragmatic acceptance by the great houses that dune controlled the priceless melange not without reason was the spice often called the secret coinage without melange the spacing guilds heighliners could not move melange precipitated the navigation trance by which a translight pathway could be seen before it was traveled without melange and its amplification of the human immunogenic system life expectancy for the very rich degenerated by a factor of at least four even the vast middle class of the imperium ate diluted melange in small sprinklings with at least one meal a day but alia had heard the mentat sincerity in idahos voice a sound which shed been awaiting with terrible expectancy choam the combine honnete was much more than house atreides much more than dune much more than the priesthood or melange it was inkvines whale fur shigawire ixian artifacts and entertainers trade in people and places the hajj those products which came from the borderline legality of tleilaxu technology it was addictive drugs and medical techniques it was transportation the guild and all of the supercomplex commerce of an empire which encompassed thousands of known planets plus some which fed secretly at the fringes permitted there for services rendered when idaho said choam he spoke of a constant ferment intrigue within intrigue a play of powers where the shift of one duodecimal point in interest payments could change the ownership of an entire planet alia returned to stand over the two seated on the divans something specific about choam bothers you she asked theres always the heavy speculative stockpiling of spice by certain houses irulan said alia slapped her hands against her own thighs then gestured at the embossed spicepaper beside irulan that demand doesnt intrigue you coming as it does all right idaho barked out with it whatre you withholding you know better than to deny the data and still expect me to function as there has been a recent very significant increase in trade for people with four specific specialties alia said and she wondered if this would be truly new information for this pair which specialties irulan asked swordmasters twisted mentats from tleilax conditioned medics from the suk school and fincap accountants most especially the latter why would questionable bookkeeping be in demand right now she directed the question at idaho function as a mentat he thought well that was better than dwelling on what alia had become he focused on her words replaying them in his mind mentat fashion swordmasters that had been his own calling once swordmasters were of course more than personal fighters they could repair force shields plan military campaigns design military support facilities improvise weapons twisted mentats the tleilaxu persisted in this hoax obviously as a mentat himself idaho knew the fragile insecurity of tleilaxu twisting great houses which bought such mentats hoped to control them absolutely impossible even piter de vries whod served the harkonnens in their assault on house atreides had maintained his own essential dignity accepting death rather than surrender his inner core of selfdom at the end suk doctors their conditioning supposedly guaranteed them against disloyalty to their ownerpatients suk doctors came very expensive increased purchase of suks would involve substantial exchanges of funds idaho weighed these facts against an increase in fincap accountants prime computation he said indicating a heavily weighted assurance that he spoke of inductive fact theres been a recent increase in wealth among houses minor some have to be moving quietly toward great house status such wealth could only come from some specific shifts in political alignments we come at last to the landsraad alia said voicing her own belief the next landsraad session is almost two standard years away irulan reminded her but political bargaining never ceases alia said and ill warrant some among those tribal signatories she gestured at the paper beside irulan are among the houses minor whove shifted their alignment perhaps irulan said the landsraad alia said what better front for the bene gesserits and what better agent for the sisterhood than my own mother alia planted herself directly in front of idaho well duncan why not function as a mentat idaho asked himself he saw the tenor of alias suspicions now after all duncan idaho had been personal house guard to the lady jessica for many years duncan alia pressed you should inquire closely after any advisory legislation which may be under preparation for the next session of the landsraad idaho said they might take the legal position that a regency cant veto certain kinds of legislation specifically adjustments of taxation and the policing of cartels there are others but not a very good pragmatic bet on their part if they take that position irulan said i agree alia said the sardaukar have no teeth and we still have our fremen legions careful alia idaho said our enemies would like nothing better than to make us appear monstrous no matter how many legions you command power ultimately rides on popular sufferance in an empire as scattered as this one popular sufferance irulan asked you mean great house sufferance alia said and how many great houses will we face under this new alliance idaho asked money is collecting in strange places the fringes irulan asked idaho shrugged it was an unanswerable question all of them suspected that one day the tleilaxu or technological tinkerers on the imperial fringes would nullify the holtzmann effect on that day shields would be useless the whole precarious balance which maintained planetary feudatories would collapse alia refused to consider that possibility well ride with what we have she said and what we have is a certain knowledge throughout the choam directorate that we can destroy the spice if they force us to it they wont risk that back to choam again irulan said unless someone has managed to duplicate the sandtroutsandworm cycle on another planet idaho said he looked speculatively at irulan excited by this question salusa secundus my contacts there remain reliable irulan said not salusa then my answer stands alia said staring at idaho we ride with what we have my move idaho thought he said whyd you drag me away from important work you couldve worked this out yourself dont take that tone with me alia snapped idahos eyes went wide for an instant hed seen the alien on alias face and it was a disconcerting sight he turned his attention to irulan but she had not seen or gave that appearance i dont need an elementary education alia said her voice still edged with alien anger idaho managed a rueful smile but his breast ached we never get far from wealth and all of its masks when we deal with power irulan drawled paul was a social mutation and as such we have to remember that he shifted the old balance of wealth such mutations are not irreversible alia said turning away from them as though shed not exposed her terrible difference wherever theres wealth in this empire they know this they also know irulan said that there are three people who could perpetuate that mutation the twins and she pointed at alia are they insane this pair idaho wondered they will try to assassinate me alia rasped and idaho sat in shocked silence his mentat awareness whirling assassinate alia why they could discredit her too easily they could cut her out of the fremen pack and hunt her down at will but the twins now he knew he was not in the proper mentat calm for such an assessment but he had to try he had to be as precise as possible at the same time he knew that precise thinking contained undigested absolutes nature was not precise the universe was not precise when reduced to his scale it was vague and fuzzy full of unexpected movements and changes humankind as a whole had to be entered into this computation as a natural phenomenon and the whole process of precise analysis represented a chopping off a remove from the ongoing current of the universe he had to get at that current see it in motion we were right to focus on choam and the landsraad irulan drawled and duncans suggestion offers a first line of inquiry for money as a translation of energy cant be separated from the energy it expresses alia said we all know this but we have to answer three specific questions when using what weapons where the twins the twins idaho thought its the twins whore in danger not alia youre not interested in who or how irulan asked if house corrino or choam or any other group employs human instruments on this planet alia said we stand a better than sixty percent chance of finding them before they act knowing when theyll act and where gives us a bigger leverage on those odds how thats just asking what weapons why cant they see it as i see it idaho wondered all right irulan said when when attention is focused on someone else alia said attention was focused on your mother at the convocation irulan said there was no attempt wrong place alia said what is she doing idaho wondered where then irulan asked right here in the keep alia said its the place where id feel most secure and least on my guard what weapons irulan asked conventional something a fremen might have on his person poisoned crysknife maula pistol a theyve not tried a hunterseeker in a long while irulan said wouldnt work in a crowd alia said therell have to be a crowd biological weapon irulan asked an infectious agent alia asked not masking her incredulity how could irulan think an infectious agent would succeed against the immunological barriers which protected an atreides i was thinking more in the line of some animal irulan said a small pet say trained to bite a specific victim inflicting a poison with its bite the house ferrets will prevent that alia said one of them then irulan asked couldnt be done the house ferrets would reject an outsider kill it you know that i was just exploring possibilities in the hope that ill alert my guards alia said as alia said guards idaho put a hand over his tleilaxu eyes trying to prevent the demanding involvement which swept over him it was rhajia the movement of infinity as expressed by life the latent cup of total immersion in mentat awareness which lay in wait for every mentat it threw his awareness onto the universe like a net falling defining the shapes within it he saw the twins crouching in darkness while giant claws raked the air about them no he whispered what alia looked at him as though surprised to find him still there he took his hand from his eyes the garments that house corrino sent he asked have they been sent on to the twins of course irulan said theyre perfectly safe no ones going to try for the twins at sietch tabr alia said not with all of those stilgartrained guards around idaho stared at her he had no particular datum to reinforce an argument based on mentat computation but he knew he knew this thing hed experienced came very close to the visionary power which paul had known neither irulan nor alia would believe it coming from him id like to alert the port authorities against allowing the importation of any outside animals he said youre not taking irulans suggestion seriously alia protested why take any chances he asked tell that to the smugglers alia said ill put my dependence on the house ferrets idaho shook his head what could house ferrets do against claws the size of those he envisioned but alia was right bribes in the right places one acquiescent guild navigator and anyplace in the empty quarter became a landing port the guild would resist a front position in any attack on house atreides but if the price were high enough well the guild could only be thought of as something like a geological barrier which made attacks difficult but not impossible they could always protest that they were just a transportation agency how could they know to what use a particular cargo would be put alia broke the silence with a purely fremen gesture a raised fist with thumb horizontal she accompanied the gesture with a traditional expletive which meant i give typhoon conflict she obviously saw herself as the only logical target for assassins and the gesture protested a universe full of undigested threats she was saying she would hurl the death wind at anyone who attacked her idaho felt the hopelessness of any protest he saw that she no longer suspected him he was going back to tabr and she expected a perfectly executed abduction of the lady jessica he lifted himself from the divan in an adrenaline surge of anger thinking if only alia were the target if only assassins could get to her for an instant he rested his hand on his own knife but it was not in him to do this far better though that she die a martyr than live to be discredited and bounded into a sandy grave yes alia said misinterpreting his expression as concern for her youd best hurry back to tabr and she thought how foolish of me to suspect duncan hes mine not jessicas it had been the demand from the tribes thatd upset her alia thought she waved an airy goodbye to idaho as he left idaho left the council chamber feeling hopeless not only was alia blind with her alien possession but she became more insane with each crisis shed already passed her danger point and was doomed but what could be done for the twins whom could he convince stilgar and what could stilgar do that he wasnt already doing the lady jessica then yes hed explore that possibility but she too might be far gone in plotting with her sisterhood he carried few illusions about that atreides concubine she might do anything at the command of the bene gesserits even turn against her own grandchildren good government never depends upon laws but upon the personal qualities of those who govern the machinery of government is always subordinate to the will of those who administer that machinery the most important element of government therefore is the method of choosing leaders law and governance the spacing guild manual why does alia wish me to share the morning audience jessica wondered theyve not voted me back into the council jessica stood in the anteroom to the keeps great hall the anteroom itself would have been a great hall anywhere other than arrakis following the atreides lead buildings in arrakeen had become ever more gigantic as wealth and power concentrated and this room epitomized her misgivings she did not like this anteroom with its tiled floor depicting her sons victory over shaddam iv she caught a reflection of her own face in the polished plasteel door which led into the great hall returning to dune forced such comparisons upon her and jessica noted only the signs of aging in her own features the oval face had developed tiny lines and the eyes were more brittle in their indigo reflection she could remember when there had been white around the blue of her eyes only the careful ministrations of a professional dresser maintained the polished bronze of her hair her nose remained small mouth generous and her body was still slender but even the bene gesserittrained muscles had a tendency toward slowing with the passage of time some might not note this and say you havent changed a bit but the sisterhoods training was a twoedged sword small changes seldom escaped the notice of people thus trained and the lack of small changes in alia had not escaped jessicas notice javid the master of alias appointments stood at the great door being very official this morning he was a robed genie with a cynical smile on his round face javid struck jessica as a paradox a wellfed fremen noting her attention upon him javid smiled knowingly shrugged his attendance in jessicas entourage had been short as hed known it would be he hated atreides but he was alias man in more ways than one if the rumors were to be believed jessica saw the shrug thought this is the age of the shrug he knows ive heard all the stories about him and he doesnt care our civilization could well die of indifference within it before succumbing to external attack the guards gurney had assigned her before leaving for the smugglers and the desert hadnt liked her coming here without their attendance but jessica felt oddly safe let someone make a martyr of her in this place alia wouldnt survive it alia would know that when jessica failed to respond to his shrug and smile javid coughed a belching disturbance of his larynx which could only have been achieved with practice it was like a secret language it said we understand the nonsense of all this pomp my lady isnt it wonderful what humans can be made to believe wonderful jessica agreed but her face gave no indication of the thought the anteroom was quite full now all of the mornings permitted supplicants having received their right of entrance from javids people the outer doors had been closed supplicants and attendants kept a polite distance from jessica but observed that she wore the formal black aba of a fremen reverend mother this would raise many questions no mark of muaddibs priesthood could be seen on her person conversations hummed as the people divided their attention between jessica and the small side door through which alia would come to lead them into the great hall it was obvious to jessica that the old pattern which defined where the regencys powers lay had been shaken i did that just by coming here she thought but i came because alia invited me reading the signs of disturbance jessica realized alia was deliberately prolonging this moment allowing the subtle currents to run their course here alia would be watching from a spy hole of course few subtleties of alias behavior escaped jessica and she felt with each passing minute how right shed been to accept the mission which the sisterhood had pressed upon her matters can not be allowed to continue in this way the leader of the bene gesserit delegation had argued surely the signs of decay have not escaped you you of all people we know why you left us but we know also how you were trained nothing was stinted in your education you are an adept of the panoplia prophetica and you must know when the souring of a powerful religion threatens us all jessica had pursed her lips in thought while staring out a window at the soft signs of spring at castle caladan she did not like to direct her thinking in such a logical fashion one of the first lessons of the sisterhood had been to reserve an attitude of questioning distrust for anything which came in the guise of logic but the members of the delegation had known that too how moist the air had been that morning jessica thought looking around alias anteroom how fresh and moist here there was a sweaty dampness to the air which evoked a sense of uneasiness in jessica and she thought ive reverted to fremen ways the air was too moist in this sietchaboveground what was wrong with the master of the stills paul would never have permitted such laxness she noted that javid his shiny face alert and composed appeared not to have noticed the fault of dampness in the anterooms air bad training for one born on arrakis the members of the bene gesserit delegation had wanted to know if she required proofs of their allegations shed given them an angry answer out of their own manuals all proofs inevitably lead to propositions which have no proof all things are known because we want to believe in them but we have submitted these questions to mentats the delegations leader had protested jessica had stared at the woman astonished i marvel that you have reached your present station and not yet learned the limits of mentats jessica had said at which the delegation had relaxed apparently it had all been a test and she had passed theyd feared of course that she had lost all touch with those balancing abilities which were at the core of bene gesserit training now jessica became softly alert as javid left his door station and approached her he bowed my lady it occurred to me that you might notve heard the latest exploit of the preacher i get daily reports on everything which occurs here jessica said let him take that back to alia javid smiled then you know he rails against your family only last night he preached in the south suburb and no one dared touch him you know why of course because they think hes my son come back to them jessica said her voice bored this question has not yet been put to the mentat idaho javid said perhaps that should be done and the thing settled jessica thought heres one who truly doesnt know a mentats limits although he dares put horns on one in his dreams if not in fact mentats share the fallibilities of those who use them she said the human mind as is the case with the mind of any animal is a resonator it responds to resonances in the environment the mentat has learned to extend his awareness across many parallel loops of causality and to proceed along those loops for long chains of consequences let him chew on that this preacher doesnt disturb you then javid asked his voice abruptly formal and portentous i find him a healthy sign she said i dont want him bothered javid clearly had not expected that blunt a response he tried to smile failed then the ruling council of the church which deifies thy son will of course bow to your wishes if you insist but certainly some explanation perhaps youd rather i explained how i fit into your schemes she said javid stared at her narrowly madame i see no logical reason why thou refusest to denounce this preacher he can not be thy son i make a reasonable request denounce him this is a set piece jessica thought alia put him up to it she said no but he defiles the name of thy son he preaches abominable things cries out against thy holy daughter he incites the populace against us when asked he said that even thou possessest the nature of evil and that thy enough of this nonsense jessica said tell alia that i refuse ive heard nothing but tales of this preacher since returning he bores me does it bore thee madame to learn that in his latest defilement he has said that thou wilt not turn against him and here clearly thou evil as i am i still wont denounce him she said it is no joking matter madame jessica waved him away angrily begone she spoke with sufficient carrying power that others heard forcing him to obey his eyes glared with rage but he managed a stiff bow and returned to his position at the door this argument fitted neatly into the observations jessica already had made when he spoke of alia javids voice carried the husky undertones of a lover no mistaking it the rumors no doubt were true alia had allowed her life to degenerate in a terrible way observing this jessica began to harbor the suspicion that alia was a willing participant in abomination was it a perverse will to selfdestruction because surely alia was working to destroy herself and the power base which fed on her brothers teachings faint stirrings of unease began to grow apparent in the anteroom the aficionados of this place would know when alia delayed too long and by now theyd all heard about jessicas peremptory dismissal of alias favorite jessica sighed she felt that her body had walked into this place with her soul creeping behind movements among the courtiers were so transparent the seeking out of important people was a dance like the wind through a field of cereal stalks the cultivated inhabitants of this place furrowed their brows and gave pragmatic rating numbers to the importance of each of their fellows obviously her rebuff of javid had hurt him few spoke to him now but the others her trained eye could read the rating numbers in the satellites attending the powerful they do not attend me because i am dangerous she thought i have the stink of someone alia fears jessica glanced around the room seeing eyes turn away they were such seriously futile people that she found herself wanting to cry out against their readymade justifications for pointless lives oh if only the preacher could see this room as it looked now a fragment of a nearby conversation caught her attention a tall slender priest was addressing his coterie no doubt supplicants here under his auspices often i must speak otherwise than i think he said this is called diplomacy the resultant laughter was too loud too quickly silenced people in the group saw that jessica had overheard my duke would have transported such a one to the farthest available hellhole jessica thought ive returned none too soon she knew now that shed lived on faraway caladan in an insulated capsule which had allowed only the most blatant of alias excesses to intrude i contributed to my own dreamexistence she thought caladan had been something like that insulation provided by a really firstclass frigate riding securely in the hold of a guild heighliner only the most violent maneuvers could be felt and those as mere softened movements how seductive it is to live in peace she thought the more she saw of alias court the more sympathy jessica felt for the words reported as coming from this blind preacher yes paul might have said such words on seeing what had become of his realm and jessica wondered what gurney had found out among the smugglers her first reaction to arrakeen had been the right one jessica realized on that first ride into the city with javid her attention had been caught by armored screens around dwellings the heavily guarded pathways and alleys the patient watchers at every turn the tall walls and indications of deep underground places revealed by thick foundations arrakeen had become an ungenerous place a contained place unreasonable and selfrighteous in its harsh outlines abruptly the anterooms small side door opened a vanguard of priestess amazons spewed into the room with alia shielded behind them haughty and moving with a confined awareness of real and terrible power alias face was composed no emotion betrayed itself as her gaze caught and held her mothers but both knew the battle had been joined at javids command the giant doors into the great hall were opened moving with a silent and inevitable sense of hidden energies alia came to her mothers side as the guards enfolded them shall we go in now mother alia asked its high time jessica said and she thought seeing the sense of gloating in alias eyes she thinks she can destroy me and remain unscathed shes mad and jessica wondered if that might not have been what idaho had wanted hed sent a message but shed been unable to respond such an enigmatic message danger must see you it had been written in a variant of the old chakobsa where the particular word chosen to denote danger signified a plot ill see him immediately when i return to tabr she thought this is the fallacy of power ultimately it is effective only in an absolute a limited universe but the basic lesson of our relativistic universe is that things change any power must always meet a greater power paul muaddib taught this lesson to the sardaukar on the plains of arrakeen his descendants have yet to learn the lesson for themselves the preacher at arrakeen the first supplicant for the morning audience was a kadeshian troubadour a pilgrim of the hajj whose purse had been emptied by arrakeen mercenaries he stood on the watergreen stone of the chamber floor with no air of begging about him jessica admired his boldness from where she sat with alia atop the sevenstep platform identical thrones had been placed here for mother and daughter and jessica made particular note of the fact that alia sat on the right the masculine position as for the kadeshian troubadour it was obvious that javids people had passed him for just this quality he now displayed his boldness the troubadour was expected to provide some entertainment for the courtiers of the great hall it was the payment hed make in lieu of the money he no longer possessed from the report of the priestadvocate who now pled the troubadours case the kadeshian had retained only the clothing on his back and the baliset slung over one shoulder on a leather cord he says he was fed a dark drink the advocate said barely hiding the smile which sought to twist his lips if it please your holiness the drink left him helpless but awake while his purse was cut jessica studied the troubadour while the advocate droned on and on with a false subservience his voice full of mucky morals the kadeshian was tall easily two meters he had a roving eye which showed intelligent alertness and humor his golden hair was worn to the shoulders in the style of his planet and there was a sense of virile strength in the broad chest and neatly tapering body which a grey hajj robe could not conceal his name was given as tagir mohandis and he was descended from merchant engineers proud of his ancestry and himself alia finally cut off the pleading with a hand wave spoke without turning the lady jessica will render first judgment in honor of her return to us thank you daughter jessica said staling the order of ascendancy to all who heard daughter so this tagir mohandis was part of their plan or was he an innocent dupe this judgment was designed to open attack on herself jessica realized it was obvious in alias attitude do you play that instrument well jessica asked indicating the ninestring baliset on the troubadours shoulder as well as the great gurney halleck himself tagir mohandis spoke loudly for all in the hall to hear and his words evoked an interested stir among the courtiers you seek the gift of transport money jessica said where would that money take you to salusa secundus and faradns court mohandis said ive heard he seeks troubadours and minstrels that he supports the arts and builds a great renaissance of cultivated life around him jessica refrained from glancing at alia theyd known of course what mohandis would ask she found herself enjoying this byplay did they think her unable to meet this thrust will you play for your passage jessica asked my terms are fremen terms if i enjoy your music i may keep you here to smooth away my cares if your music offends me i may send you to toil in the desert for your passage money if i deem your playing just right for faradn who is said to be an enemy of the atreides then i will send you to him with my blessing will you play on these terms tagir mohandis he threw his head back in a great roaring laugh his blond hair danced as he unslung the baliset and tuned it deftly to indicate acceptance of her challenge the crowd in the chamber started to press closer but were held back by courtiers and guards presently mohandis strummed a note holding the bass hum of the side strings with a fine attention to their compelling vibration then lifting his voice in a mellow tenor he sang obviously improvising but his touch so deft that jessica was enthralled before she focused on his lyrics you say you long for caladan seas where once you ruled atreides without surcease but exiles dwell in strangerlands you say twere bitter men so rude to sell your dreams of shaihulud for tasteless food and exiles dwell in strangerlands you make arrakis grow infirm silence the passage of the worm and end your term as exiles dwell in strangerlands alia they name you coanteen that spirit who is never seen until enough alia screamed she pushed herself half out of her throne ill have you alia jessica spoke just loud enough voice pitched just right to avoid confrontation while gaining full attention it was a masterful use of voice and all who heard it recognized the trained powers in this demonstration alia sank back into her seat and jessica noted that she showed not the slightest discomfiture this too was anticipated jessica thought how very interesting the judgment on this first one is mine jessica reminded her very well alias words were barely audible i find this one a fitting gift for faradn jessica said he has a tongue which cuts like a crysknife such bloodletting as that tongue can administer would be healthy for our own court but id rather he ministered to house corrino a light rippling of laughter spread through the hall alia permitted herself a snorting exhalation do you know what he called me he didnt call you anything daughter he but reported that which he or anyone else could hear in the streets there they call you coanteen the female deathspirit who walks without feet alia snarled if you put away those who report accurately youll keep only those who know what you want to hear jessica said her voice sweet i can think of nothing more poisonous than to rot in the stink of your own reflections audible gasps came from those immediately below the thrones jessica focused on mohandis who remained silent standing completely uncowed he awaited whatever judgment was passed upon him as though it did not matter mohandis was exactly the kind of man her duke would have chosen to have by his side in troubled times one who acted with confidence of his own judgment but accepted whatever befell even death without berating his fate then why had he chosen this course why did you sing those particular words jessica asked him he lifted his head to speak clearly id heard that the atreides were honorable and openminded id a thought to test it and perhaps to stay here in your service thereby having the time to seek out those who robbed me and deal with them in my own fashion he dares test us alia muttered why not jessica asked she smiled down at the troubadour to signal goodwill he had come into this hall only because it offered him opportunity for another adventure another passage through his universe jessica found herself tempted to bind him to her own entourage but alias reaction boded evil for brave mohandis there were also those signs which said this was the course expected of the lady jessica take a brave and handsome troubadour into her service as shed taken brave gurney halleck best mohandis were sent on his way though it rankled to lose such a fine specimen to faradn he shall go to faradn jessica said see that he gets his passage money let his tongue draw the blood of house corrino and see how he survives it alia glowered at the floor then produced a belated smile the wisdom of the lady jessica prevails she said waving mohandis away that did not go the way she wanted jessica thought but there were indicators in alias manner that a more potent test remained another supplicant was being brought forward jessica noting her daughters reaction felt the gnawing of doubts the lesson learned from the twins was needed here let alia be abomination still she was one of the preborn she could know her mother as she knew herself it did not compute that alia would misjudge her mothers reactions in the matter of the troubadour why did alia stage that confrontation to distract me there was no more time to reflect the second supplicant had taken his place below the twin thrones his advocate at his side the supplicant was a fremen this time an old man with the sand marks of the desertborn on his face he was not tall but had a wiry body and the long dishdasha usually worn over a stillsuit gave him a stately appearance the robe was in keeping with his narrow face and beaked nose the glaring eyes of blueonblue he wore no stillsuit and seemed uncomfortable without it the gigantic space of the audience hall must seem to him like the dangerous open air which robbed his flesh of its priceless moisture under the hood which had been thrown partly back he wore the knotted keffiya headdress of a naib i am ghadhean alfali he said placing one foot on the steps to the thrones to signify his status above that of the mob i was one of muaddibs death commandos and i am here concerning a matter of the desert alia stiffened only slightly a small betrayal alfalis name had been on that demand to place jessica on the council a matter of the desert jessica thought ghadhean alfali had spoken before his advocate could open the pleading with that formal fremen phrase he had placed them on notice that he brought them something of concern to all of dune and that he spoke with the authority of a fedaykin who had offered his life beside that of paul muaddib jessica doubted that this was what ghadhean alfali had told javid or the advocate general in seeking audience here her guess was confirmed as an official of the priesthood rushed forward from the rear of the chamber waving the black cloth of intercession my ladies the official called out do not listen to this man he comes under false jessica watching the priest run toward them caught a movement out of the corners of her eyes saw alias hand signaling in the old atreides battle language now jessica could not determine where the signal was directed but acted instinctively with a lurch to the left taking throne and all she rolled away from the crashing throne as she fell came to her feet as she heard the sharp spat of a maula pistol and again but she was moving with the first sound felt something tug at her right sleeve she dove into the throng of supplicants and courtiers gathered below the dais alia she noted had not moved surrounded by people jessica stopped ghadhean alfali she saw had dodged to the other side of the dais but the advocate remained in his original position it had all happened with the rapidity of an ambush but everyone in the hall knew where trained reflexes should have taken anyone caught by surprise alia and the advocate stood frozen in their exposure a disturbance toward the middle of the room caught jessicas attention and she forced a way through the throng saw four supplicants holding the priest official his black cloth of intercession lay near his feet a maula pistol exposed in its folds alfali thrust his way past jessica looked from the pistol to the priest the fremen let out a cry of rage came up from his belt with an achag blow the fingers of his left hand rigid they caught the priest in the throat and he collapsed strangling without a backward glance at the man he had killed the old naib turned an angry face toward the dais dalalil annubuwwa alfali called placing both palms against his forehead then lowering them the qadis assalaf will not let me be silenced if i do not slay those who interfere others will slay them he thinks he was the target jessica realized she looked down at her sleeve put a finger in the neat hole left by the maula pellet poisoned no doubt the supplicants had dropped the priest he lay writhing on the floor dying with his larynx crushed jessica motioned to a pair of shocked courtiers standing at her left said i want that man saved for questioning if he dies you die as they hesitated peering toward the dais she used voice on them move the pair moved jessica thrust herself to alfalis side nudged him you are a fool naib they were after me not you several people around them heard her in the immediate shocked silence alfali glanced at the dais with its one toppled throne and alia still seated on the other the look of realization which came over his face couldve been read by a novice fedaykin jessica said reminding him of his old service to her family we who have been scorched know how to stand back to back trust me my lady he said taking her meaning immediately a gasp behind jessica brought her whirling and she felt alfali move to stand with his back to her a woman in the gaudy garb of a city fremen was straightening from beside the priest on the floor the two courtiers were nowhere to be seen the woman did not even glance at jessica but lifted her voice in the ancient keening of her people the call for those who serviced the deathstills the call for them to come and gather a bodys water into the tribal cistern it was a curiously incongruous noise coming from one dressed as this woman was jessica felt the persistence of the old ways even as she saw the falseness in this city woman the creature in the gaudy dress obviously had killed the priest to make sure he was silenced why did she bother jessica wondered she had only to wait for the man to die of asphyxiation the act was a desperate one a sign of deep fear alia sat forward on the edge of her throne her eyes aglitter with watchfulness a slender woman wearing the braid knots of alias own guards strode past jessica bent over the priest straightened and looked back at the dais he is dead have him removed alia called she motioned to guards below the dais straighten the lady jessicas chair so youll try to brazen it out jessica thought did alia think anyone had been fooled alfali had spoken of the qadis assalaf calling on the holy fathers of fremen mythology as his protectors but no supernatural agency had brought a maula pistol into this room where no weapons were permitted a conspiracy involving javids people was the only answer and alias unconcern about her own person told everyone she was a part of that conspiracy the old naib spoke over his shoulder to jessica accept my apologies my lady we of the desert come to you as our last desperate hope and now we see that you still have need of us matricide does not sit well on my daughter jessica said the tribes will hear of this alfali promised if you have such desperate need of me jessica asked why did you not approach me at the convocation in sietch tabr stilgar would not permit it ahhh jessica thought the rule of the naibs in tabr stilgars word was law the toppled throne had been straightened alia motioned for her mother to return said all of you please note the death of that traitorpriest those who threaten me die she glanced at alfali my thanks to you naib thanks for a mistake alfali muttered he looked at jessica you were right my rage removed one who shouldve been questioned jessica whispered mark those two courtiers and the woman in the colorful dress fedaykin i want them taken and questioned it will be done he said if we get out of here alive jessica said come let us go back and play our parts as you say my lady together they returned to the dais jessica mounting the steps and resuming her position beside alia alfali remaining in the supplicants position below now alia said one moment daughter jessica said she held up her sleeve exposed the hole with a finger through it the attack was aimed at me the pellet almost found me even as i was dodging you will all note that the maula pistol is no longer down there she pointed who has it there was no response perhaps it could be traced jessica said what nonsense alia said i was the jessica half turned toward her daughter motioned with her left hand someone down there has that pistol dont you have a fear that one of my guards has it alia said then that guard will bring the weapon to me jessica said shes already taken it away how convenient jessica said what are you saying alia demanded jessica allowed herself a grim smile i am saying that two of your people were charged with saving that traitorpriest i warned them that they would die if he died they will die i forbid it jessica merely shrugged we have a brave fedaykin here alia said motioning toward alfali this argument can wait it can wait forever jessica said speaking in chakobsa her words doublebarbed to tell alia that no argument would stop the death command we shall see alia said she turned to alfali why are you here ghadhean alfali to see the mother of muaddib the naib said what is left of the fedaykin that band of brothers who served her son pooled their poor resources to buy my way in here past the avaricious guardians who shield the atreides from the realities of arrakis alia said anything the fedaykin require they have only he came to see me jessica interrupted what is your desperate need fedaykin alia said i speak for the atreides here what is be silent you murderous abomination jessica snapped you tried to have me killed daughter i say it for all here to know you cant have everyone in this hall killed to silence them as that priest was silenced yes the naibs blow wouldve killed the man but he couldve been saved he couldve been questioned you have no concern that he was silenced spray your protests upon us as you will your guilt is written in your actions alia sat in frozen silence face pale and jessica watching the play of emotions across her daughters face saw a terrifyingly familiar movement of alias hands an unconscious response which once had identified a deadly enemy of the atreides alias fingers moved in a tapping rhythm little finger twice index finger three times ring finger twice little finger once ring finger twice and back through the tapping in the same order the old baron the focus of jessicas eyes caught alias attention and she glanced down at her hand held it still looked back at her mother to see the terrible recognition a gloating smile locked alias mouth so you have your revenge upon us jessica whispered have you gone mad mother alia asked i wish i had jessica said and she thought she knows i will confirm this to the sisterhood she knows she may even suspect ill tell the fremen and force her into a trial of possession she can not let me leave here alive our brave fedaykin waits while we argue alia said jessica forced her attention back to the old naib she brought her responses under control said you came to see me ghadhean yes my lady we of the desert see terrible things happening the little makers come out of the sand as was foretold in the oldest prophecies shaihulud no longer can be found except in the deeps of the empty quarter we have abandoned our friend the desert jessica glanced at alia who merely motioned for jessica to continue jessica looked out over the throng in the chamber saw the shocked alertness on every face the import of the fight between mother and daughter had not been lost on this throng and they must wonder why the audience continued she returned her attention to alfali ghadhean what is this talk of little makers and the scarcity of sandworms mother of moisture he said using her old fremen title we were warned of this in the kitab alibar we beseech thee let it not be forgotten that on the day muaddib died arrakis turned by itself we can not abandon the desert hah alia sneered the superstitious riffraff of the inner desert fear the ecological transformation they i hear you ghadhean jessica said if the worms go the spice goes if the spice goes what coin do we have to buy our way sounds of surprise gasps and startled whispers could be heard spreading across the great hall the chamber echoed to the sound alia shrugged superstitious nonsense alfali lifted his right hand to point at alia i speak to the mother of moisture not to the coanteen alias hands gripped the arms of her throne but she remained seated alfali looked at jessica once it was the land where nothing grew now there are plants they spread like lice upon a wound there have been clouds and rain along the belt of dune rain my lady oh precious mother of muaddib as sleep is deaths brother so is rain on the belt of dune it is the death of us all we do only what lietkynes and muaddib himself designed for us to do alia protested what is all of this superstitious gabble we revere the words of lietkynes who told us i wish to see this entire planet caught up in a net of green plants so it will be and what of the worms and the spice jessica asked therell always be some desert alia said the worms will survive shes lying jessica thought why does she lie help us mother of moisture alfali pleaded with an abrupt sensation of double vision jessica felt her awareness lurch propelled by the old naibs words it was the unmistakable adab the demanding memory which came upon one of itself it came without qualifications and held her senses immobile while the lesson of the past was impressed upon her awareness she was caught up in it completely a fish in the net yet she felt the demand of it as a humanmost moment each small part a reminder of creation every element of the lessonmemory was real but insubstantial in its constant change and she knew this was the closest she might ever come to experiencing the prescient dietgrasp which had inflicted itself upon her son alia lied because she was possessed by one who would destroy the atreides she was in herself the first destruction then alfali spoke the truth the sandworms are doomed unless the course of the ecological transformation is modified in the pressure of revelation jessica saw the people of the audience reduced to slow motion their roles identified for her she could pick the ones charged with seeing that she did not leave here alive and the path through them lay there in her awareness as though outlined in bright light confusion among them one of them feinted to stumble into another whole groups tangled she saw also that she might leave this great hall only to fall into other hands alia did not care if she created a martyr no the thing which possessed her did not care now in this frozen time jessica chose a way to save the old naib and send him as messenger the way through the audience remained indelibly clear how simple it was they were buffoons with barricaded eyes their shoulders held in positions of immovable defense each position upon the great floor could be seen as an atropic collision from which dead flesh might slough away to reveal skeletons their bodies their clothes and their faces described individual hells the insucked breast of concealed terrors the glittering hook of a jewel become substitute armor the mouths were judgments full of frightened absolutes cathedral prisms of eyebrows showing lofty and religious sentiments which their loins denied jessica sensed dissolution in the shaping forces loosed upon arrakis alfalis voice had been like a distrans in her soul awakening a beast from the deepest part of her in an eyeblink jessica moved from the adab into the universe of movement but it was a different universe from the one which had commanded her attention only a second before alia was starting to speak but jessica said silence then there are those who fear that i have returned without reservation to the sisterhood but since that day in the desert when the fremen gave the gift of life to me and to my son i have been fremen and she lapsed into the old tongue which only those in this room who could profit by it would understand onsar akhaka zeiiman aw maslumen support your brother in his time of need whether he be just or unjust her words had the desired effect a subtle shifting of positions within the chamber but jessica raged on this ghadhean alfali an honest fremen comes here to tell me what others should have revealed to me let no one deny this the ecological transformation has become a tempest out of control wordless confirmations could be seen throughout the room and my daughter delights in this jessica said mektub almellah you carve wounds upon my flesh and write there in salt why did the atreides find a home here because the mohalata was natural to us to the atreides government was always a protective partnership mohalata as the fremen have always known it now look at her jessica pointed at alia she laughs alone at night in contemplation of her own evil spice production will fall to nothing or at best a fraction of its former level and when word of that gets out well have a corner on the most priceless product in the universe alia shouted well have a corner on hell jessica raged and alia lapsed into the most ancient chakobsa the atreides private language with its difficult glottal stops and clicks now you know mother did you think a granddaughter of baron harkonnen would not appreciate all of the lifetimes you crushed into my awareness before i was even born when i raged against what youd done to me i had only to ask myself what the baron wouldve done and he answered understand me atreides bitch he answered me jessica heard the venom and the confirmation of her guess abomination alia had been overwhelmed within possessed by that cahueit of evil the baron vladimir harkonnen the baron himself spoke from her mouth now uncaring of what was revealed he wanted her to see his revenge wanted her to know that he could not be cast out im supposed to remain here helpless in my knowledge jessica thought with the thought she launched herself onto the path the adab had revealed shouting fedaykin follow me it turned out there were six fedaykin in the room and five of them won through behind her when i am weaker than you i ask you for freedom because that is according to your principles when i am stronger than you i take away your freedom because that is according to my principles words of an ancient philosopher attributed by harq alada to one louis veuillot leto leaned out the covert exit from the sietch saw the bight of the cliff towering above his limited view late afternoon sunlight cast long shadows in the cliffs vertical striations a skeleton butterfly flew in and out of the shadows its webbed wings a transparent lacery against the light how delicate that butterfly was to exist here he thought directly ahead of him lay the apricot orchard with children working there to gather the fallen fruit beyond the orchard was the qanat he and ghanima had given the slip to their guards by losing themselves in a sudden crush of incoming workers it had been a relatively simple matter to worm their way down an air passage to its connection with the steps to the covert exit now they had only to mingle themselves with the children work their way to the qanat and drop into the tunnel there they could move beside the predator fish which kept sandtrout from encysting the tribes irrigation water no fremen would yet think of a human risking accidental immersion in water he stepped out of the protective passages the cliff stretched away on both sides of him turned horizontal just by the act of his own movement ghanima moved closely behind him both carried small fruit baskets woven of spicefiber but each basket carried a sealed package fremkit maula pistol crysknife and the new robes sent by faradn ghanima followed her brother into the orchard mingled with the working children stillsuit masks concealed every face they were just two more workers here but she felt the action drawing her life away from protective boundaries and known ways what a simple step it was that step from one danger into another in their baskets those new garments sent by faradn conveyed a purpose well understood by both of them ghanima had accented this knowledge by sewing their personal motto we share in chakobsa above the hawk crest at each breast it would be twilight soon and beyond the qanat which marked off sietch cultivation there would come a special quality of evening which few places in the universe could match it would be that softly lighted desert world with its persistent solitude its saturated sense that each creature in it was alone in a new universe weve been seen ghanima whispered bending to work beside her brother guards no others good we must move swiftly she said leto acknowledged this by moving away from the cliff through the orchard he thought with his fathers thoughts everything remains mobile in the desert or perishes far out on the sand he could see the attendants outcropping reminder of the need for mobility the rocks lay static and rigid in their watchful enigma fading yearly before the onslaught of winddriven sand one day the attendant would be sand as they neared the qanat they heard music from a high entrance of the sietch it was an oldstyle fremen group twoholed flutes tambourines tympani made on spiceplastic drums with skins stretched taut across one end no one asked what animal on this planet provided that much skin stilgar will remember what i told him about that cleft in the attendant leto thought hell come in the dark when its too late and then hell know presently they were at the qanat they slipped into an open tube climbed down the inspection ladder to the service ledge it was dusky damp and cold in the qanat and they could hear the predator fish splashing any sandtrout trying to steal this water would find its watersoftened inner surface attacked by the fish humans must be wary of them too careful leto said moving down the slippery ledge he fastened his memory to times and places his flesh had never known ghanima followed at the end of the qanat they stripped to their stillsuits and put on the new robes they left the old fremen robes behind as they climbed out another inspection tube wormed their way over a dune and down the far side there they sat shielded from the sietch strapped on maula pistols and crysknives slipped the fremkit packs onto their shoulders they no longer could hear the music leto arose struck out through the valley between the dunes ghanima fell into step behind him moving with practiced unrhythmical quiet over the open sand below the crest of each dune they bent low and crept across into the hidden lee there to pause and peer backward seeking pursuit no hunters had emerged upon the desert by the time they reached the first rocks in the shadows of the rocks they worked their way around the attendant climbed to a ledge looking out upon the desert colors blinked far out on the bled the darkening air held the fragility of fine crystal the landscape which met their gaze was beyond pity nowhere did it pause no hesitations in it at all the gaze stayed upon no single place in its scanning movements across that immensity it is the horizon of eternity leto thought ghanima crouched beside her brother thinking the attack will come soon she listened for the slightest sound her whole body transformed into a single sense of taut probing leto sat equally alert he knew now the culmination of all the training which had gone into the lives he shared so intimately in this wilderness one developed a firm dependence upon the senses all of the senses life became a hoard of stored perceptions each one linked only to momentary survival presently ghanima climbed up the rocks and peered through a notch at the way they had come the safety of the sietch seemed a lifetime away a bulk of dumb cliffs rising out of brownpurple distance dustblurred edges at the rim where the last of the sunlight cast its silver streaks still no pursuit could be seen in the intervening distance she returned to letos side itll be a predatory animal leto said thats my tertiary computation i think you stopped computing too soon ghanima said itll be more than one animal house corrino has learned not to put all of its hopes into a single bag leto nodded agreement his mind felt suddenly heavy with the multitude of lives which his difference provided him all of those lives his even before birth he was saturated with living and wanted to flee from his own consciousness the inner world was a heavy beast which could devour him restlessly he arose climbed to the notch ghanima had used peered at the cliffs of the sietch back there beneath the cliff he could see how the qanat drew a line between life and death on the oasis edge he could see camel sage onion grass gobi feather grass wild alfalfa in the last of the light he could make out the black movements of birds pickhopping in the alfalfa the distant grain tassels were ruffled by a wind which drew shadows that moved right up to the orchard the motion caught at his awareness and he saw that the shadows hid within their fluid form a larger change and that larger change gave ransom to the turning rainbows of a silverdusted sky what will happen out here he asked himself and he knew it would either be death or the play of death himself the object ghanima would be the one to return believing the reality of a death she had seen or reporting sincerely from a deep hypnotic compulsion that her brother was indeed slain the unknowns of this place haunted him he thought how easy it would be to succumb to the demand for prescience to risk launching his awareness into an unchanging absolute future the small vision of his dream was bad enough though he knew he dared not risk the larger vision presently he returned to ghanimas side no pursuit yet he said the beasts they send for us will be large ghanima said we may have time to see them coming not if they come in the night itll be dark very soon she said yes its time we went down into our place he indicated the rocks to their left and below them where windsand had eaten a tiny cleft in the basalt it was large enough to admit them but small enough to keep out large creatures leto felt himself reluctant to go there but knew it must be done that was the place hed pointed out to stilgar they may really kill us he said this is the chance we have to take she said we owe it to our father im not arguing and he thought this is the correct path we do the right thing but he knew how dangerous it was to be right in this universe their survival now demanded vigor and fitness and an understanding of the limitations in every moment fremen ways were their best armor and the bene gesserit knowledge was a force held in reserve they were both thinking now as atreidestrained battle veterans with no other defenses than a fremen toughness which was not even hinted at by their childish bodies and their formal attire leto fingered the hilt of the poisontipped crysknife at his waist unconsciously ghanima duplicated the gesture shall we go down now ghanima asked as she spoke she saw the movement far below them small movement made less threatening by distance her stillness alerted leto before she could utter a warning tigers he said laza tigers she corrected him they see us he said wed better hurry she said a maula would never stop those creatures they willve been well trained for this theyll have a human director somewhere around he said leading the way at a fast lope down the rocks to the left ghanima agreed but kept it to herself saving her strength thered be a human around somewhere those tigers couldnt be allowed to run free until the proper moment the tigers moved fast in the last of the light leaping from rock to rock they were eyeminded creatures and soon it would be night the time of the earminded the bellcall of a nightbird came from the attendants rocks to emphasize the change creatures of the darkness already were hustling in the shadows of the etched crevasses still the tigers remained visible to the running twins the animals flowed with power a rippling sense of golden sureness in every movement leto felt that he had stumbled into this place to free himself from his soul he ran with the sure knowledge that he and ghanima could reach their narrow notch in time but his gaze kept returning with fascination to the oncoming beasts one stumble and were lost he thought that thought reduced the sureness of his knowledge and he ran faster you bene gesserit call your activity of the panoplia prophetica a science of religion very well i a seeker after another kind of scientist find this an appropriate definition you do indeed build your own myths but so do all societies you i must warn however you are behaving as so many other misguided scientists have behaved your actions reveal that you wish to take something out of away from life it is time you were reminded of that which you so often profess one can not have a single thing without its opposite the preacher at arrakeen a message to the sisterhood in the hour before dawn jessica sat immobile on a worn rug of spicecloth around her were the bare rocks of an old and poor sietch one of the original settlements it lay below the rim of red chasm sheltered from the westerlies of the desert alfali and his brothers had brought her here now they awaited word from stilgar the fedaykin had moved cautiously in the matter of communication however stilgar was not to know their location the fedaykin already knew they were under a procesverbal an official report of crimes against the imperium alia was taking the tack that her mother had been suborned by enemies of the realm although the sisterhood had not yet been named the highhanded tyrannical nature of alias power was out in the open however and her belief that because she controlled the priesthood she controlled the fremen was about to be tested jessicas message to stilgar had been direct and simple my daughter is possessed and must be put to the trial fears destroyed values though and it already was known that some fremen would prefer not to believe this accusation their attempts to use the accusation as a passport had brought on two battles during the night but the ornithopters alfalis people had stolen had brought the fugitives to this precarious safety red chasm sietch word was going out to the fedaykin from here but fewer than two hundred of them remained on arrakis the others held posts throughout the empire reflecting upon these facts jessica wondered if she had come to the place of her death some of the fedaykin believed it but the death commandos accepted this easily enough alfali had merely grinned at her when some of his young men voiced their fears when god hath ordained a creature to die in a particular place he causeth that creatures wants to direct him to that place the old naib had said the patched curtains at her doorway rustled alfali entered the old mans narrow windburned face appeared drawn his eyes feverish obviously he had not rested someone comes he said from stilgar perhaps he lowered his eyes glanced leftward in the manner of the old fremen who brought bad news what is it jessica demanded we have word from tabr that your grandchildren are not there he spoke without looking at her alia she has ordered that the twins be given over to her custody but sietch tabr reports that the children are not there that is all we know stilgars sent them into the desert jessica said possibly but it is known that he was searching for them all through the night perhaps it was a trick on his part thats not stilgars way she said and thought unless the twins put him up to it but that didnt feel right either she wondered at herself no sensations of panic to suppress and her fears for the twins were tempered by what ghanima had revealed she peered up at alfali found him studying her with pity in his eyes she said theyve gone into the desert by themselves alone those two children she did not bother to explain that those two children probably knew more about desert survival than most living fremen her thoughts were fixed instead on letos odd behavior when hed insisted that she allow herself to be abducted shed put the memory aside but this moment demanded it hed said she would know the moment to obey him the messenger should be in the sietch by now alfali said i will bring him to you he let himself out through the patched curtain jessica stared at the curtain it was red cloth of spicefiber but the patches were blue the story was that this sietch had refused to profit from muaddibs religion earning the enmity of alias priesthood the people here reportedly had put their capital into a scheme to raise dogs as large as ponies dogs bred for intelligence as guardians of children the dogs had all died some said it was poison and the priests were blamed she shook her head to drive out these reflections recognizing them for what they were ghafla the gadfly distraction where had those children gone to jacurutu they had a plan they tried to enlighten me to the extent they thought id accept she remembered and when theyd reached the limits as they saw them leto had commanded her to obey hed commanded her leto had recognized what alia was doing that much was obvious both twins had spoken of their aunts affliction even when defending her alia was gambling on the rightness of her position in the regency demanding custody of the twins confirmed that jessica found a harsh laugh shaking her own breast the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam had been fond of explaining this particular error to her student jessica if you focus your awareness only upon your own rightness then you invite the forces of opposition to overwhelm you this is a common error even i your teacher have made it and even i your student have made it jessica whispered to herself she heard fabrics whispering in the passage beyond the curtain two young fremen entered part of the entourage theyd picked up during the night the two were obviously awed at being in the presence of muaddibs mother jessica had read them completely they were nonthinkers attaching themselves to any fancied power for the identity which this gave them without a reflection from her they were empty thus they were dangerous we were sent ahead by alfali to prepare you one of the young fremen said jessica felt an abrupt clenching tightness in her breast but her voice remained calm prepare me for what stilgar has sent duncan idaho as his messenger jessica pulled her aba hood up over her hair an unconscious gesture duncan but he was alias tool the fremen whod spoken took a half step forward idaho says he has come to take you to safety but alfali does not see how this can be it seems passing strange indeed jessica said but there are stranger things in our universe bring him they glanced at each other but obeyed leaving together with such a rush that they tore another rent in the worn curtain presently idaho stepped through the curtain followed by the two fremen and alfali bringing up the rear hand on his crysknife idaho appeared composed he wore the dress casuals of an atreides house guard a uniform which had changed little in more than fourteen centuries arrakis had replaced the old goldhandled plasteel blade with a crysknife but that was minor im told you wish to help me jessica said as odd as that may seem he said but didnt alia send you to abduct me she asked a slight raising of his black eyebrows was the only mark of surprise the manyfaceted tleilaxu eyes continued to stare at her with glittering intensity those were her orders he said alfalis knuckles went white on his crysknife but he did not draw ive spent much of this night reviewing the mistakes i made with my daughter she said there were many idaho agreed and i shared in most of them she saw now that his jaw muscles were trembling it was easy to listen to the arguments which led us astray jessica said i wanted to leave this place you you wanted a girl you saw as a younger version of me he accepted this silently where are my grandchildren she demanded voice going harsh he blinked then stilgar believes they have gone into the desert hiding perhaps they saw this crisis coming jessica glanced at alfali who nodded his recognition that she had anticipated this what is alia doing jessica asked she risks civil war he said do you believe itll come to that idaho shrugged probably not these are softer times there are more people willing to listen to pleasant arguments i agree she said well and good what of my grandchildren stilgar will find them if yes i see it was really up to gurney halleck then she turned to look at the rock wall on her left alia grasps the power firmly now she looked back at idaho you understand one uses power by grasping it lightly to grasp too strongly is to be taken over by power and thus to become its victim as my duke always told me idaho said somehow jessica knew he meant the older leto not paul she asked where am i to be taken in this abduction idaho peered down at her as though trying to see into the shadows created by the hood alfali stepped forward my lady you are not seriously thinking is it not my right to decide my own fate jessica asked but this alfalis head nodded toward idaho this was my loyal guardian before alia was born jessica said before he died saving my sons life and mine we atreides always honor certain obligations then you will go with me idaho asked where would you take her alfali asked best that you dont know jessica said alfali scowled but remained silent his face betrayed indecision an understanding of the wisdom in her words but an unresolved doubt of idahos trustworthiness what of the fedaykin who helped me jessica asked they have stilgars countenance if they can get to tabr idaho said jessica faced alfali i command you to go there my friend stilgar can use fedaykin in the search for my grandchildren the old naib lowered his gaze as muaddibs mother commands hes still obeying paul she thought we should be out of here quickly idaho said the search is certain to include this place and that early jessica rocked forward and arose with that fluid grace which never quite left the bene gesserit even when they felt the pangs of age and she felt old now after her night of flight even as she moved her mind remained on that peculiar interview with her grandson what was he really doing she shook her head covered the motion by adjusting her hood it was too easy to fall into the trap of underestimating leto life with ordinary children conditioned one to a false view of the inheritance which the twins enjoyed her attention was caught by idahos pose he stood in the relaxed preparedness for violence one foot ahead of the other a stance which she herself had taught him she shot a quick look at the two young fremen at alfali doubts still assailed the old fremen naib and the two young men felt this i trust this man with my life she said addressing herself to alfali and it is not the first time my lady alfali protested its just he glared at idaho hes the husband of the coanteen and he was trained by my duke and by me she said but hes a ghola the words were torn from alfali my sons ghola she reminded him it was too much for a former fedaykin whod once pledged himself to support muaddib to the death he sighed stepped aside and motioned the two young men to open the curtains jessica stepped through idaho behind her she turned spoke to alfali in the doorway you are to go to stilgar hes to be trusted yes but she still heard doubts in the old mans voice idaho touched her arm we should go at once is there anything you wish to take only my common sense she said why do you fear youre making a mistake she glanced up at him you were always the best thopter pilot in our service duncan this did not amuse him he stepped ahead of her moving swiftly retracing the way hed come alfali fell into step beside jessica how did you know he came by thopter he wears no stillsuit jessica said alfali appeared abashed by this obvious perception he would not be silenced though our messenger brought him here directly from stilgars they couldve been seen were you seen duncan jessica asked idahos back you know better than that he said we flew lower than the dune tops they turned into a side passage which led downward in spiral steps debouching finally into an open chamber welllighted by glowglobes high in the brown rock a single ornithopter sat facing the far wall crouched there like an insect waiting to spring the wall would be false rock then a door opening onto the desert as poor as this sietch was it still maintained the instruments of secrecy and mobility idaho opened the ornithopters door for her helped her into the righthand seat as she moved past him she saw perspiration on his forehead where a lock of the black goathair lay tumbled unbidden jessica found herself recalling that head spouting blood in a noisy cavern the steely marbles of the tleilaxu eyes brought her out of that recollection nothing was as it seemed anymore she busied herself fastening her seatbelt its been along time since youve flown me duncan she said long and far time he said he was already checking the controls alfali and the two younger fremen waited beside the controls to the false rock prepared to open it do you think i harbor doubts about you jessica asked speaking softly to idaho idaho kept his attention on an engine instrument ignited the impellers and watched a needle move a smile touched his mouth a quick and harsh gesture in his sharp features gone as quickly as it had come i am still atreides jessica said alia is not have no fear he grated i still serve the atreides alia is no longer atreides jessica repeated you neednt remind me he snarled now shut up and let me fly this thing the desperation in his voice was quite unexpected out of keeping with the idaho shed known putting down a renewed sense of fear jessica asked where are we going duncan you can tell me now but he nodded to alfali and the false rock opened outward into bright silvery sunlight the ornithopter leaped outward and up its wings throbbing with the effort the jets roaring and they mounted into an empty sky idaho set a southwesterly course toward sahaya ridge which could be seen as a dark line upon the sand presently he said do not think harshly of me my lady i havent thought harshly of you since that night you came into our arrakeen great hall roaring drunk on spicebeer she said but his words renewed her doubts and she fell into the relaxed preparedness of complete pranabindu defense i remember that night well he said i was very young inexperienced but the best swordmaster in my dukes retinue not quite my lady gurney could best me six times out of ten he glanced at her where is gurney doing my bidding he shook his head do you know where were going she asked yes my lady then tell me very well i promised that i would create a believable plot against house atreides only one way really to do that he pressed a button on the control wheel and cocoon restraints whipped from jessicas seat enfolded her in unbreakable softness leaving only her head exposed im taking you to salusa secundus he said to faradn in a rare uncontrolled spasm jessica surged against the restraints felt them tighten easing only when she relaxed but not before she felt the deadly shigawire concealed in the protective sheathing the shigawire release has been disconnected he said not looking at her oh yes and dont try voice on me ive come a long way since the days when you could move me that way he looked at her the tleilaxu armored me against such wiles youre obeying alia jessica said and she not alia he said we do the preachers bidding he wants you to teach faradn as once you taught paul jessica remained in frozen silence remembering letos words that she would find an interesting student presently she said this preacher is he my son idahos voice seemed to come from a great distance i wish i knew the universe is just there thats the only way a fedaykin can view it and remain the master of his senses the universe neither threatens nor promises it holds things beyond our sway the fall of a meteor the eruption of a spiceblow growing old and dying these are the realities of this universe and they must be faced regardless of how you feel about them you can not fend off such realities with words they will come at you in their own wordless way and then then you will understand what is meant by life and death understanding this you will be filled with joy muaddib to his fedaykin and those are the things we have set in motion wensicia said these things were done for you faradn remained motionless seated across from his mother in her morning room the suns golden light came from behind him casting his shadow on the whitecarpeted floor light reflected from the wall behind his mother drew a nimbus around her hair she wore her usual white robe trimmed in gold reminders of royal days her heartshaped face appeared composed but he knew she was watching his every reaction his stomach felt empty although hed just come from breakfast you dont approve wensicia asked what is there to disapprove he asked well that we kept this from you until now oh that he studied his mother tried to reflect upon his complex position in this matter he could only think on a thing he had noticed recently that tyekanik no longer called her my princess what did he call her queen mother why do i feel a sense of loss he wondered what am i losing the answer was obvious he was losing his carefree days time for those pursuits of the mind which so attracted him if this plot unfolded by his mother came off those things would be gone forever new responsibilities would demand his attention he found that he resented this deeply how dared they take such liberties with his time and without even consulting him out with it his mother said somethings wrong what if this plan fails he asked saying the first thing that came into his mind how can it fail i dont know any plan can fail howre you using idaho in all of this idaho whats this interest in oh yes that mystic fellow tyek brought here without consulting me that was wrong of him the mystic spoke of idaho didnt he it was a clumsy lie on her part and faradn found himself staring at his mother in wonderment shed known about the preacher all along its just that ive never seen a ghola he said she accepted this said were saving idaho for something important faradn chewed silently at his upper lip wensicia found herself reminded of his dead father dalak had been like that at times very inward and complex difficult to read dalak she reminded herself had been related to count hasimir fenring and thered been something of the dandy and the fanatic in both of them would faradn follow in that path she began to regret having tyek lead the lad into the arrakeen religion who knew where that might take him what does tyek call you now faradn asked whats that she was startled by this shift ive noticed that he doesnt call you my princess anymore how observant he is she thought wondering why this filled her with disquiet does he think ive taken tyek as a lover nonsense it wouldnt matter one way or the other then why this question he calls me my lady she said why because thats the custom in all of the great houses including the atreides he thought its less suggestive if overheard she explained some will think weve given up our legitimate aspirations who would be that stupid he asked she pursed her lips decided to let it pass a small thing but great campaigns were made up of many small things the lady jessica shouldnt have left caladan he said she shook her head sharply what was this his mind was darting around like a crazy thing she said what do you mean she shouldnt have gone back to arrakis he said thats bad strategy makes one wonder wouldve been better to have her grandchildren visit her on caladan hes right she thought dismayed that this had never occurred to her tyek would have to explore this immediately again she shook her head no what was faradn doing he must know that the priesthood would never risk both twins in space she said this is it the priesthood or the lady alia he asked noting that her thoughts had gone where he had wanted he found exhilaration in his new importance the mindgames available in political plotting it had been a long time since his mothers mind had interested him she was too easily maneuvered you think alia wants power for herself wensicia asked he looked away from her of course alia wanted the power for herself all of the reports from that accursed planet agreed on this his thoughts took off on a new course ive been reading about their planetologist he said there has to be a clue to the sandworms and the haploids in there somewhere if only leave that to others now she said beginning to lose patience with him is this all you have to say about the things weve done for you you didnt do them for me he said whaaat you did it for house corrino he said and youre house corrino right now ive not been invested you have responsibilities she said what about all of the people who depend upon you as if her words put the burden upon him he felt the weight of all those hopes and dreams which followed house corrino yes he said i understand about them but i find some of the things done in my name distasteful dis how can you say such a thing we do what any great house would do in promoting its own fortunes do you i think youve been a bit gross no dont interrupt me if im to be an emperor then youd better learn how to listen to me do you think i can not read between the lines how were those tigers trained she remained speechless at this cutting demonstration of his perceptive abilities i see he said well ill keep tyek because i know you led him into this hes a good officer under most circumstances but hell fight for his own principles only in a friendly arena his principles the difference between a good officer and a poor one is strength of character and about five heartbeats he said he has to stick by his principles wherever theyre challenged the tigers were necessary she said ill believe that if they succeed he said but i will not condone what had to be done in training them dont protest its obvious they were conditioned you said it yourself whatre you going to do she asked im going to wait and see he said perhaps ill become emperor she put a hand to her breast sighed for a few moments there hed terrified her shed almost believed he would denounce her principles but he was committed now she could see that faradn got up went to the door and rang for his mothers attendants he looked back we are through arent we yes she raised a hand as he started to leave wherere you going to the library ive become fascinated lately by corrino history he left her then sensing how he carried his new commitment with him damn her but he knew he was committed and he recognized that there was a deep emotional difference between history as recorded on shigawire and read at leisure a deep difference between that kind of history and the history which one lived this new living history which he felt gathering around him possessed a sense of plunging into an irreversible future faradn could feel himself driven now by the desires of all those whose fortunes rode with him he found it strange that he could not pin down his own desires in this it is said of muaddib that once when he saw a weed trying to grow between two rocks he moved one of the rocks later when the weed was seen to be flourishing he covered it with the remaining rock that was its fate he explained the commentaries now ghanima shouted leto two steps ahead of her in reaching the narrow cut in the rocks did not hesitate he dove into the slit crawled forward until darkness enfolded him he heard ghanima drop behind him a sudden stillness and her voice not hurrying or fearful im stuck he stood up knowing this would bring his head within reach of questing claws reversed himself in the narrow passage crept back until he felt ghanimas outstretched hand its my robe she said its caught he heard rocks falling directly below them pulled on her hand but felt only a small gain there was panting below them a growl leto tensed himself wedging his hips against the rock heaved on ghanimas arm cloth ripped and he felt her jerk toward him she hissed and he knew she felt pain but he pulled once more harder she came farther into the hole then all the way dropping beside him they were too close to the end of the cut though he turned dropped to all fours scrambled deeper ghanima pulled herself along behind him there was a panting intensity to her movements which told him shed been hurt he came to the end of the opening rolled over and peered upward out the narrow gap of their sanctuary the opening was about two meters above him filled with stars something large obscured the stars a rumbling growl filled the air around the twins it was deep menacing an ancient sound hunter speaking to its prey how badly are you hurt leto asked keeping his voice even she matched him tone for tone one of them clawed me breached my stillsuit along the left leg im bleeding how bad vein i can stop it use pressure he said dont move ill take care of our friends careful she said theyre bigger than i expected leto unsheathed his crysknife reached up with it he knew the tiger would be questing downward claws raking the narrow passage where its body could not go slowly slowly he extended the knife abruptly something struck the top of the blade he felt the blow all along his arm almost lost his grip on the knife blood gushed along his hand spattered his face and there came an immediate scream which deafened him the stars became visible something threshed and flung itself down the rocks toward the sand in a violent caterwauling once more the stars were obscured and he heard the hunters growl the second tiger had moved into place unmindful of its companions fate theyre persistent leto said you got one for sure ghanima said listen the screams and thrashing convulsions below them were growing fainter the second tiger remained though a curtain against the stars leto sheathed his blade touched ghanimas arm give me your knife i want a fresh tip to make sure of this one do you think theyll have a third one in reserve she asked not likely laza tigers hunt in pairs just as we do she said as we do he agreed he felt the handle of her crysknife slip into his palm gripped it tightly once more he began that careful upward questing the blade encountered only empty air even when he reached into a level dangerous to his body he withdrew pondering this cant you find it its not behaving the way the other one did its still there smell it he swallowed in a dry throat a fetid breath moist with the musky smell of the cat assaulted his nostrils the stars were still blocked from view nothing could be heard of the first cat the crysknifes poison had completed its work i think im going to have to stand up he said no it has to be teased into reach of the knife yes but we agreed that if one of us could avoid being wounded and youre wounded so youre the one going back he said but if youre badly injured i wont be able to leave you she said do you have a better idea give me back my knife but your leg i can stand on the good one that thing could take your head off with one sweep maybe the maula if theres anyone out there to hear theyll know we came prepared for i dont like your taking this risk he said whoevers out there mustnt learn we have maulas not yet she touched his arm ill be careful keep my head down as he remained silent she said you know im the one who has to do this give me back my knife reluctantly he quested with his free hand found her hand and returned the knife it was the logical thing to do but logic warred with every emotion in him he felt ghanima pull away heard the sandy rasping of her robe against the rock she gasped and he knew she must be standing be very careful he thought and he almost pulled her back to insist they use a maula pistol but that could warn anyone out there that they had such weapons worse it could drive the tiger out of reach and theyd be trapped in here with a wounded tiger waiting for them in some unknown place out on those rocks ghanima took a deep breath braced her back against one wall of the cleft i must be quick she thought she reached upward with the knife point her left leg throbbed where the claws had raked it she felt the crusting of blood against her skin there and the warmth of a new flow very quick she sank her senses into the calm preparation for crisis which the bene gesserit way provided put pain and all other distractions out of her awareness the cat must reach down slowly she passed the blade along the opening where was the damned animal once more she raked the air nothing the tiger would have to be lured into attack carefully she probed with her sense of smell warm breath came from her left she poised herself drew in a deep breath screamed taqwa it was the old fremen battlecry its meaning found in the most ancient legends the price of freedom with the cry she tipped the blade and stabbed along the clefts dark opening claws found her elbow before the knife touched flesh and she had time only to tip her wrist toward the pain before agony raked her arm from elbow to wrist through the pain she felt the poison tip sink into the tiger the blade was wrenched from her numb fingers but again the narrow gap of the cleft lay open to the stars and the wailing voice of a dying cat filled the night they followed it by its death throes a thrashing passage down the rocks presently the deathsilence came it got my arm ghanima said trying to bind a loose fold of her robe around the wound badly i think so i cant feel my hand let me get a light and not until we get under cover ill hurry she heard him twisting to reach his fremkit felt the dark slickness of a nightshield as it was slipped over her head tucked in behind her he didnt bother to make it moisture tight my knifes on this side she said i can feel the handle with my knee leave it for now he ignited a single small globe the brilliance of it made her blink leto put the globe on the sandy floor at one side gasped as he saw her arm one claw had opened a long gaping wound which twisted from the elbow along the back of her arm almost to the wrist the wound described the way she had rotated her arm to present the knife tip to the tigers paw ghanima glanced once at the wound closed her eyes and began reciting the litany against fear leto found himself sharing her need but put aside the clamor of his own emotions while he set about binding up the wound it had to be done carefully to stop the flow of blood while retaining the appearance of a clumsy job which ghanima might have done by herself he made her tie off the knot with her free hand holding one end of the bandage in her teeth now lets look at the leg he said she twisted around to present the other wound it was not as bad two shallow claw cuts along the calf they had bled freely into the stillsuit however he cleaned it up as best he could bound the wound beneath the stillsuit he sealed the suit over the bandage i got sand in it he said have it treated as soon as you get back sand in our wounds she said thats an old story for fremen he managed a smile sat back ghanima took a deep breath weve pulled it off not yet she swallowed fighting to recover from the aftermath of shock her face appeared pale in the light of the glowglobe and she thought yes we must move fast now whoever controlled those tigers could be out there right now leto staring at his sister felt a sudden wrenching sense of loss it was a deep pain which shot through his breast he and ghanima must separate now for all of those years since birth they had been as one person but their plan demanded now that they undergo a metamorphosis going their separate ways into uniqueness where the sharing of daily experiences would never again unite them as they once had been united he retreated into the necessarily mundane heres my fremkit i took the bandages from it someone may look yes she exchanged kits with him someone out there has a transmitter for those cats he said most likely hell be waiting near the qanat to make certain of us she touched her maula pistol where it sat atop the fremkit picked it up and thrust it into the sash beneath her robe my robes torn yes searchers may get here soon he said they may have a traitor among them best you slip back alone get harrah to hide you ill ill start the search for the traitor as soon as i get back she said she peered into her brothers face sharing his painful knowledge that from this point on they would accumulate a store of differences never again would they be as one sharing knowledge which no one else could understand ill go to jacurutu he said fondak she said he nodded his agreement jacurutufondak they had to be the same place it was the only way the legendary place could have been hidden smugglers had done it of course how easy for them to convert one label into another acting under the cover of the unspoken convention by which they were allowed to exist the ruling family of a planet must always have a back door for escape in extremis and a small share in smuggling profits kept the channels open in fondakjacurutu the smugglers had taken over a completely operative sietch untroubled by a resident population and they had hidden jacurutu right out in the open secure in the taboo which kept fremen from it no fremen will think to search for me in such a place he said theyll inquire among the smugglers of course but well do as we agreed she said its just i know hearing his own voice leto realized they were drawing out these last moments of sameness a wry grin touched his mouth adding years to his appearance ghanima realized she was seeing him through a veil of time looking at an older leto tears burned her eyes you neednt give water to the dead just yet he said brushing a finger against the dampness on her cheeks ill go out far enough that no one will hear and ill call a worm he indicated the collapsed maker hooks strapped to the outside of his fremkit ill be at jacurutu before dawn two days from now ride swiftly my old friend she whispered ill come back to you my only friend he said remember to be careful at the qanat choose a good worm she said giving him the fremen words of parting her left hand extinguished the glowglobe and the nightseal rustled as she pulled it aside folded it and tucked it into her kit she felt him go hearing only the softest of sounds quickly fading into silence as he crept down the rocks into the desert ghanima steeled herself then for what she had to do leto must be dead to her she had to make herself believe it there could be no jacurutu in her mind no brother out there seeking a place lost in fremen mythology from this point onward she could not think of leto as alive she must condition herself to react out of a total belief that her brother was dead killed here by laza tigers not many humans could fool a truthsayer but she knew that she could do it might have to do it the multilives she and leto shared had taught them the way a hypnotic process old in shebas time although she might be the only human alive who could recall sheba as a reality the deep compulsions had been designed with care and for a long time after leto had gone ghanima reworked her selfawareness building the lonely sister the surviving twin until it was a believable totality as she did this she found the inner world becoming silent blanked away from intrusion into her consciousness it was a side effect she had not expected if only leto could have lived to learn this she thought and she did not find the thought a paradox standing she peered down at the desert where the tiger had taken leto there was a sound growing in the sand out there a familiar sound to fremen the passage of a worm rare as they had become in these parts a worm still came perhaps the first cats death throes yes leto had killed one cat before the other one got him it was oddly symbolic that a worm should come so deep was her compulsion that she saw three dark spots far down on the sand the two tigers and leto then the worm came and there was only sand with its surface broken into new waves by the passage of shaihulud it had not been a very large worm but large enough and her compulsion did not permit her to see a small figure riding on the ringed back fighting her grief ghanima sealed her fremkit crept cautiously from her hiding place hand on her maula pistol she scanned the area no sign of a human with a transmitter she worked her way up the rocks and across to the far side creeping through moonshadows waiting and waiting to be sure no assassin lurked in her path across the open space she could see torches at tabr the wavering activity of a search a dark patch moved across the sand toward the attendant she chose her path to run far to the north of the approaching party went down to the sand and moved into the dune shadows careful to make her steps fall in a broken rhythm which would not attract a worm she set out into the lonely distance which separated tabr from the place where leto had died she would have to be careful at the qanat she knew nothing must prevent her from telling how her brother had perished saving her from the tigers governments if they endure always tend increasingly toward aristocratic forms no government in history has been known to evade this pattern and as the aristocracy develops government tends more and more to act exclusively in the interests of the ruling class whether that class be hereditary royalty oligarchs of financial empires or entrenched bureaucracy politics as repeat phenomenon bene gesserit training manual why does he make us this offer faradn asked thats most essential he and the bashar tyekanik stood in the lounge of faradns private quarters wensicia sat at one side on a low blue divan almost as audience rather than participant she knew her position and resented it but faradn had undergone a terrifying change since that morning when shed revealed their plots to him it was late afternoon at corrino castle and the low light accented the quiet comfort of this lounge a room lined with actual books reproduced in plastino with shelves revealing a horde of player spools data blocks shigawire reels mnemonic amplifiers there were signs all around that this room was much used worn places on the books bright metal on the amplifiers frayed corners on the data blocks there was only the one divan but many chairs all of them sensiform floaters designed for unobtrusive comfort faradn stood with his back to a window he wore a plain sardaukar uniform in grey and black with only the golden lionclaw symbols on the wings of his collar as decoration he had chosen to receive the bashar and his mother in this room hoping to create an atmosphere of more relaxed communication than could be achieved in a more formal setting but tyekaniks constant my lord this and my lady that kept them at a distance my lord i dont think hed make this offer were he unable to deliver tyekanik said of course not wensicia intruded faradn merely glanced at his mother to silence her asked weve put no pressure on idaho made no attempt to seek delivery on the preachers promise none tyekanik said then why does duncan idaho noted all of his life for his fanatic loyalty to the atreides offer now to deliver the lady jessica into our hands these rumors of trouble on arrakis wensicia ventured unconfirmed faradn said is it possible that the preacher has precipitated this possible tyekanik said but i fail to see a motive he speaks of seeking asylum for her faradn said that might follow if those rumors precisely his mother said or it could be a ruse of some sort tyekanik said we can make several assumptions and explore them faradn said what if idaho has fallen into disfavor with his lady alia that might explain matters wensicia said but he no word yet from the smugglers faradn interrupted why cant we transmission is always slow in this season tyekanik said and the needs of security yes of course but still faradn shook his head i dont like our assumption dont be too quick to abandon it wensicia said all of those stories about alia and that priest whatever his name is javid faradn said but the mans obviously hes been a valuable source of information for us wensicia said i was about to say that hes obviously a double agent faradn said how could he indict himself in this hes not to be trusted there are too many signs i fail to see them she said he was suddenly angry with her denseness take my word for it mother the signs are there ill explain later im afraid i must agree tyekanik said wensicia lapsed into hurt silence how dared they push her out of council like this as though she were some lightheaded fancy woman with no we mustnt forget that idaho was once a ghola faradn said the tleilaxu he glanced sidelong at tyekanik that avenue will be explored tyekanik said he found himself admiring the way faradns mind worked alert questing sharp yes the tleilaxu in restoring life to idaho might have planted a powerful barb in him for their own use but i fail to apprehend a tleilaxu motive faradn said an investment in our fortunes tyekanik said a small insurance for future favors large investment id call it faradn said dangerous wensicia said faradn had to agree with her the lady jessicas capabilities were notorious in the empire after all shed been the one whod trained muaddib if it became known that we hold her faradn said yes thatd be a twoedged sword tyekanik said but it need not be known let us assume faradn said that we accept this offer whats her value can we exchange her for something of greater importance not openly wensicia said of course not he peered expectantly at tyekanik that remains to be seen tyekanik said faradn nodded yes i think if we accept we should consider the lady jessica as money banked for indeterminate use after all wealth doesnt necessarily have to be spent on any particular thing its just potentially useful shed be a very dangerous captive tyekanik said there is that to consider indeed faradn said im told that her bene gesserit ways permit her to manipulate a person just by the subtle employment of her voice or her body wensicia said irulan once divulged to me some of the things shed learned she was showing off at the time and i saw no demonstrations still the evidence is pretty conclusive that bene gesserits have their ways of achieving their ends were you suggesting faradn asked that she might seduce me wensicia merely shrugged id say shes a little old for that wouldnt you faradn asked with a bene gesserit nothings certain tyekanik said faradn experienced a shiver of excitement tinged with fear playing this game to restore house of corrinos high seat of power both attracted and repelled him how attractive it remained the urge to retire from this game into his preferred pursuits historical research and learning the manifest duties for ruling here on salusa secundus the restoration of his sardaukar forces was a task in itself and for that job tyek was still a good tool one planet was after all an enormous responsibility but the empire was an even greater responsibility far more attractive as an instrument of power and the more he read about muaddibpaul atreides the more fascinated faradn became with the uses of power as titular head of house corrino heir of shaddam iv what a great achievement it would be to restore his line to the lion throne he wanted that he wanted it faradn had found that by repeating this enticing litany to himself several times he could overcome momentary doubts tyekanik was speaking and of course the bene gesserit teach that peace encourages aggressions thus igniting war the paradox of how did we get on this subject faradn asked bringing his attention back from the arena of speculation why wensicia said sweetly having noted the woolgathering expression on her sons face i merely asked if tyek was familiar with the driving philosophy behind the sisterhood philosophy should be approached with irreverence faradn said turning to face tyekanik in regard to idahos offer i think we should inquire further when we think we know something thats precisely the moment when we should look deeper into the thing it will be done tyekanik said he liked this cautious streak in faradn but hoped it did not extend to those military decisions which required speed and precision with seeming irrelevancy faradn asked do you know what i find most interesting about the history of arrakis it was the custom in primitive times for fremen to kill on sight anyone not clad in a stillsuit with its easily visible and characteristic hood what is your fascination with the stillsuit tyekanik asked so youve noticed eh how could we not notice wensicia asked faradn sent an irritated glance at his mother why did she interrupt like that he returned his attention to tyekanik the stillsuit is the key to that planets character tyek its the hallmark of dune people tend to focus on the physical characteristics the stillsuit conserves body moisture recycles it and makes it possible to exist on such a planet you know the fremen custom was to have one stillsuit for each member of a family except for food gatherers they had spares but please note both of you he moved to include his mother in this how garments which appear to be stillsuits but really arent have become high fashion throughout the empire its such a dominant characteristic for humans to copy the conqueror do you really find such information valuable tyekanik asked his tone puzzled tyek tyek without such information one can not govern i said the stillsuit was the key to their character and it is its a conservative thing the mistakes they make will be conservative mistakes tyekanik glanced at wensicia who was staring at her son with a worried frown this characteristic of faradns both attracted and worried the bashar it was so unlike old shaddam now there had been an essential sardaukar a military killer with few inhibitions but shaddam had fallen to the atreides under that damnable paul indeed what he read of paul atreides revealed just such characteristics as faradn now displayed it was possible that faradn might hesitate less than the atreides over brutal necessities but that was his sardaukar training many have governed without using this kind of information tyekanik said faradn merely stared at him for a moment then governed and failed tyekaniks mouth drew into a stiff line at this obvious allusion to shaddams failure that had been a sardaukar failure too and no sardaukar could recall it easily having made his point faradn said you see tyek the influence of a planet upon the mass unconscious of its inhabitants has never been fully appreciated to defeat the atreides we must understand not only caladan but arrakis one planet soft and the other a training ground for hard decisions that was a unique event that marriage of atreides and fremen we must know how it worked or we wont be able to match it let alone defeat it what does this have to do with idahos offer wensicia demanded faradn glanced pityingly down at his mother we begin their defeat by the kinds of stress we introduce into their society thats a very powerful tool stress and the lack of it is important too did you not mark how the atreides helped things grow soft and easy here tyekanik allowed himself a curt nod of agreement that was a good point the sardaukar could not be permitted to grow too soft this offer from idaho still bothered him though he said perhaps itd be best to reject the offer not yet wensicia said weve a spectrum of choices open to us our task is to identify as much of the spectrum as we can my son is right we need more information faradn stared at her measuring her intent as well as the surface meaning of her words but will we know when weve passed the point of no alternate choice he asked a sour chuckle came from tyekanik if you ask me were long past the point of no return faradn tipped his head back to laugh aloud but we still have alternate choices tyek when we come to the end of our rope thats an important place to recognize in this age when the means of human transport include devices which can span the deeps of space in transtime and other devices which can carry men swiftly over virtually impassable planetary surfaces it seems odd to think of attempting long journeys afoot yet this remains a primary means of travel on arrakis a fact attributed partly to preference and partly to the brutal treatment which this planet reserves for anything mechanical in the strictures of arrakis human flesh remains the most durable and reliable resource for the hajj perhaps it is the implicit awareness of this fact which makes arrakis the ultimate mirror of the soul handbook of the hajj slowly cautiously ghanima made her way back to tabr holding herself to the deepest shadows of the dunes crouching in stillness as the search party passed to the south of her terrible awareness gripped her the worm which had taken the tigers and letos body the dangers ahead he was gone her twin was gone she put aside all tears and nurtured her rage in this she was pure fremen and she knew this reveling in it she understood what was said about fremen they were not supposed to have a conscience having lost it in a burning for revenge against those who had driven them from planet to planet in the long wandering that was foolishness of course only the rawest primitive had no conscience fremen possessed a highly evolved conscience which centered on their own welfare as a people it was only to outsiders that they seemed brutish just as outsiders appeared brutish to fremen every fremen knew very well that he could do a brutal thing and feel no guilt fremen did not feel guilt for the same things that aroused such feelings in others their rituals provided a freedom from guilts which might otherwise have destroyed them they knew in their deepest awareness that any transgression could be ascribed at least in part to well recognized extenuating circumstances the failure of authority or a natural bad tendency shared by all humans or to bad luck which any sentient creature should be able to identify as a collision between mortal flesh and the outer chaos of the universe in this context ghanima felt herself to be the pure fremen a carefully prepared extension of tribal brutality she needed only a target and that obviously was house corrino she longed to see faradns blood spilled on the ground at her feet no enemy awaited her at the qanat even the search parties had gone elsewhere she crossed the water on an earth bridge crept through tall grass toward the covert exit of the sietch abruptly light flared ahead of her and ghanima threw herself flat on the ground she peered out through stalks of giant alfalfa a woman had entered the covert passage from the outside and someone had remembered to prepare that passage in the way any sietch entrance should be prepared in troubled times one greeted anyone entering the sietch with bright light temporarily blinding the newcomer and giving guards time to decide but such a greeting was never meant to be broadcast out over the desert the light visible here meant the outer seals had been left aside ghanima felt a tug of bitterness at this betrayal of sietch security this flowing light the ways of the laceshirt fremen were to be found everywhere the light continued to throw its fan over the ground at the cliff base a young girl ran out of the orchards darkness into the light something fearful about her movements ghanima could see the bright circle of a glowglobe within the passage a halo of insects around it the light illuminated two dark shadows in the passage a man and the girl they were holding hands as they stared into each others eyes ghanima sensed something wrong about the man and woman there they were not just two lovers stealing a moment from the search the light was suspended above and beyond them in the passage the two talked against a glowing arch throwing their shadows into the outer night where anyone could be a watcher of their movements now and again the man would free a hand the hand would come gesturing into the light a sharp and furtive movement which once completed returned to the shadows lonely sounds of night creatures filled the darkness around ghanima but she screened out such distractions what was it about those two the mans motions were so static so careful he turned reflection from the womans robe illuminated him exposing a raw red face with a large blotchy nose ghanima drew in a deep silent breath of recognition palimbasha he was a grandson of a naib whose sons had fallen in atreides service the face and another thing revealed by the open swinging of his robe as he turned drew for ghanima a complete picture he wore a belt beneath the robe and attached to the belt was a box which glistened with keys and dials it was an instrument of the tleilaxu or the ixians for certain and it had to be the transmitter which had released the tigers palimbasha this meant that another naibate family had gone over to house corrino who was the woman then no matter she was someone being used by palimbasha unbidden a bene gesserit thought came into ghanimas mind each planet has its own period and each life likewise she recalled palimbasha well watching him there with that woman seeing the transmitter the furtive movements palimbasha taught in the sietch school mathematics the man was a mathematical boor he had attempted to explain muaddib through mathematics until censured by the priesthood he was a mindslaver and his enslaving process could be understood with extreme simplicity he transferred technical knowledge without a transfer of values i shouldve suspected him earlier she thought the signs were all there then with an acid tightening of her stomach he killed my brother she forced herself to calmness palimbasha would kill her too if she tried to pass him there in the covert passage now she understood the reason for this unfremen display of light this betrayal of the hidden entrance they were watching by that light to see if either of their victims had escaped it must be a terrible time of waiting for them not knowing and now that ghanima had seen the transmitter she could explain certain of the hand motions palimbasha was depressing one of the transmitters keys frequently an angry gesture the presence of this pair said much to ghanima likely every way into the sietch carried a similar watcher in its depths she scratched her nose where dust tickled it her wounded leg still throbbed and the knife arm ached when it didnt burn the fingers remained numb should it come to a knife she would have to use the blade in her left hand ghanima thought of using the maula pistol but its characteristic sound would be sure to attract unwanted attention some other way would have to be found palimbasha turned away from the entrance once more he was a dark object against the light the woman turned her attention to the outer night while she talked there was a trained alertness about the woman a sense that she knew how to look into the shadows using the edges of her eyes she was more than just a useful tool then she was part of the deeper conspiracy ghanima recalled now that palimbasha aspired to be a kaymakam a political governor under the regency he would be part of a larger plan that was clear there would be many others with him even here in tabr ghanima examined the edges of the problem thus exposed probed into it if she could take one of these guardians alive many others would be forfeit the whiffle of a small animal drinking at the qanat behind her caught ghanimas awareness natural sounds and natural things her memory searched through a strange silent barrier in her mind found a priestess of jowf captured in assyria by sennacherib the memories of that priestess told ghanima what would have to be done here palimbasha and his woman there were mere children wayward and dangerous they knew nothing of jowf knew not even the name of the planet where sennacherib and the priestess had faded into dust the thing which was about to happen to the pair of conspirators if it were explained to them could only be explained in terms of beginning here and ending here rolling onto her side ghanima freed her fremkit slipped the sandsnorkel from its bindings she uncapped the sandsnorkel removed the long filter within it now she had an open tube she selected a needle from the repair pack unsheathed her crysknife and inserted the needle into the poison hollow at the knifes tip that place where once a sandworms nerve had fitted her injured arm made the work difficult she moved carefully and slowly handling the poisoned needle with caution while she took a wad of spicefiber from its chamber in the kit the needles shank fitted tightly into the fiber wad forming a missile which went tightly into the tube of the sandsnorkel holding the weapon flat ghanima wormed her way closer to the light moving slowly to cause minimal disturbance in the alfalfa as she moved she studied the insects around the light yes there were piume flies in that fluttering mob they were notorious biters of human flesh the poisoned dart might go unnoticed swatted aside as a biting fly a decision remained which one of those two to take the man or the woman muriz the name came unbidden into ghanimas mind that was the womans name it recalled things said about her she was one of those who fluttered around palimbasha as the insects fluttered around the light she was easily swayed a weak one very well palimbasha had chosen the wrong companion for this night ghanima put the tube to her mouth and with the memory of the priestess of jowf clearly in her awareness she sighted carefully expelled her breath in one strong surge palimbasha batted at his cheek drew away a hand with a speck of blood on it the needle was nowhere to be seen flicked away by the motion of his own hand the woman said something soothing and palimbasha laughed as he laughed his legs began to give away beneath him he sagged against the woman who tried to support him she was still staggering with the dead weight when ghanima came up beside her and pressed the point of an unsheathed crysknife against her waist in a conversational tone ghanima said make no sudden moves muriz my knife is poisoned you may let go of palimbasha now he is dead in all major socializing forces you will find an underlying movement to gain and maintain power through the use of words from witch doctor to priest to bureaucrat it is all the same a governed populace must be conditioned to accept powerwords as actual things to confuse the symbolized system with the tangible universe in the maintenance of such a power structure certain symbols are kept out of the reach of common understanding symbols such as those dealing with economic manipulation or those which define the local interpretation of sanity symbolsecrecy of this form leads to the development of fragmented sublanguages each being a signal that its users are accumulating some form of power with this insight into a power process our imperial security force must be ever alert to the formation of sublanguages lecture to the arrakeen war college by the princess irulan it is perhaps unnecessary to tell you faradn said but to avoid any errors ill announce that a mute has been stationed with orders to kill you both should i show signs of succumbing to witchery he did not expect to see any effect from these words both the lady jessica and idaho gratified his expectations faradn had chosen with care the setting for this first examination of the pair shaddams old state audience chamber what it lacked in grandeur it made up for with exotic appointments outside it was a winter afternoon but the windowless chambers lighting simulated a timeless summer day bathed in golden light from artfully scattered glowglobes of the purest ixian crystal the news from arrakis filled faradn with quiet elation leto the male twin was dead killed by an assassintiger ghanima the surviving sister was in the custody of her aunt and reputedly was a hostage the full report did much to explain the presence of idaho and the lady jessica sanctuary was what they wanted corrino spies reported an uneasy truce on arrakis alia had agreed to submit herself to a test called the trial of possession the purpose of which had not been fully explained however no date had been set for this trial and two corrino spies believed it might never take place this much was certain though there had been fighting between desert fremen and the imperial military fremen an abortive civil war which had brought government to a temporary standstill stilgars holdings were now neutral ground designated after an exchange of hostages ghanima evidently had been considered one of these hostages although the working of this remained unclear jessica and idaho had been brought to the audience securely bound in suspensor chairs both were held down by deadly thin strands of shigawire which would cut flesh at the slightest struggle two sardaukar troopers had brought them checked the bindings and had gone away silently the warning had indeed been unnecessary jessica had seen the armed mute standing against a wall at her right an old but efficient projectile weapon in his hand she allowed her gaze to roam over the rooms exotic inlays the broad leaves of the rare iron bush had been set with eye pearls and interlaced to form the center crescent of the domed ceiling the floor beneath her was alternate blocks of diamond wood and kabuzu shell arranged within rectangular borders of passaquet bones these had been set on end lasercut and polished selected hard materials decorated the walls in stresswoven patterns which outlined the four positions of the lion symbol claimed by descendants of the late shaddam iv the lions were executed in wild gold faradn had chosen to receive the captives while standing he wore uniform shorts and a light golden jacket of elfsilk open at the throat his only decoration was the princely starburst of his royal family worn at the left breast he was attended by the bashar tyekanik wearing sardaukar dress tans and heavy boots an ornate lasegun carried in a front holster at the belt buckle tyekanik whose heavy visage was known to jessica from bene gesserit reports stood three paces to the left and slightly behind faradn a single throne of dark wood sat on the floor near the wall directly behind the two now faradn said addressing jessica do you have anything to say i would inquire why we are bound thus jessica said indicating the shigawire we have only just now received reports from arrakis to explain your presence here faradn said perhaps ill have you released presently he smiled if you he broke off as his mother entered by the state doors behind the captives wensicia hurried past jessica and idaho without a glance presented a small message cube to faradn actuated it he studied the glowing face glancing occasionally at jessica back to the cube the glowing face went dark and he returned the cube to his mother indicated that she should show it to tyekanik while she was doing this he scowled at jessica presently wensicia stationed herself at faradns right hand the darkened cube in her hand partly concealed in a fold of her white gown jessica glanced to her right at idaho but he refused to meet her gaze the bene gesserit are displeased with me faradn said they believe i was responsible for the death of your grandson jessica held her face emotionless thinking so ghanimas story is to be trusted unless she didnt like the suspected unknowns idaho closed his eyes opened them to glance at jessica she continued to stare at faradn idaho had told her about this rhajia vision but shed seemed unworried he didnt know how to catalogue her lack of emotion she obviously knew something though that she wasnt revealing this is the situation faradn said and he proceeded to explain everything hed learned about events on arrakis leaving out nothing he concluded your granddaughter survives but shes reportedly in the custody of the lady alia this should gratify you did you kill my grandson jessica asked faradn answered truthfully i did not i recently learned of a plot but it was not of my making jessica looked at wensicia saw the gloating expression on that heartshaped face thought her doing the lioness schemes for her cub this was a game the lioness might live to regret returning her attention to faradn jessica said but the sisterhood believes you killed him faradn turned to his mother show her the message as wensicia hesitated he spoke with an edge of anger which jessica noted for future use i said show it to her face pale wensicia presented the message face of the cube to jessica activated it words flowed across the face responding to jessicas eve movements bene gesserit council on wallach ix files formal protest against house corrino in assassination of leto atreides ii arguments and showing of evidence are assigned to landsraad internal security commission neutral ground will be chosen and names of judges will be submitted for approval by all parties your immediate response required sabit rekush for the landsraad wensicia returned to her sons side how do you intend to respond jessica asked wensicia said since my son has not yet been formally invested as head of house corrino i will where are you going this last was addressed to faradn who as she spoke turned and headed for a side door near the watchful mute faradn paused half turned im going back to my books and the other pursuits which hold much more interest for me how dare you wensicia demanded a dark flush spread from her neck up across her cheeks ill dare quite a few things in my own name faradn said you have made decisions in my name decisions which i find extremely distasteful either i will make the decisions in my own name from this point on or you can find yourself another heir for house corrino jessica passed her gaze swiftly across the participants in this confrontation seeing the real anger in faradn the bashar aide stood stiffly at attention trying to make it appear that he had heard nothing wensicia hesitated on the brink of screaming rage faradn appeared perfectly willing to accept any outcome from his throw of the dice jessica rather admired his poise seeing many things in this confrontation which could be of value to her it seemed that the decision to send assassin tigers against her grandchildren had been made without faradns knowledge there could be little doubt of his truthfulness in saying hed learned of the plot after its inception there was no mistaking the real anger in his eyes as he stood there ready to accept any decision wensicia took a deep trembling breath then very well the formal investiture will take place tomorrow you may act in advance of it now she looked at tyekanik who refused to meet her gaze therell be a screaming fight once mother and son get out of here jessica thought but i do believe he has won she allowed her thoughts to return then to the message from the landsraad the sisterhood had judged their messengers with a finesse which did credit to bene gesserit planning hidden in the formal notice of protest was a message for jessicas eyes the fact of the message said the sisterhoods spies knew jessicas situation and theyd gauged faradn with a superb nicety to guess hed show it to his captive id like an answer to my question jessica said addressing herself to faradn as he returned to face her i shall tell the landsraad that i had nothing to do with this assassination faradn said i will add that i share the sisterhoods distaste for the manner of it although i can not be completely displeased at the outcome my apologies for any grief this may have caused you fortune passes everywhere fortune passes everywhere jessica thought thatd been a favorite saying of her duke and thered been something in faradns manner which said he knew this she forced herself to ignore the possibility that theyd really killed leto she had to assume that ghanimas fears for leto had motivated a complete revelation of the twins plan the smugglers would put gurney in position to meet leto then and the sisterhoods devices would be carried out leto had to be tested he had to be without the testing he was doomed as alia was doomed and ghanima well that could be faced later there was no way to send the preborn before a reverend mother gaius helen mohiam jessica allowed herself a deep sigh sooner or later she said itll occur to someone that you and my granddaughter could unite our two houses and heal old wounds this has already been mentioned to me as a possibility faradn said glancing briefly as his mother my response was that id prefer to await the outcome of recent events on arrakis theres no need for a hasty decision theres always the possibility that youve already played into my daughters hands jessica said faradn stiffened explain matters on arrakis are not as they may seem to you jessica said alia plays her own game abominations game my granddaughter is in danger unless alia can contrive a way to use her you expect me to believe that you and your daughter oppose each other that atreides fights atreides jessica looked at wensicia back to faradn corrino fights corrino a wry smile moved faradns lips well taken how would i have played into your daughters hands by becoming implicated in my grandsons death by abducting me abduct dont trust this witch wensicia cautioned ill choose whom to trust mother faradn said forgive me lady jessica but i dont understand this matter of abduction id understood that you and your faithful retainer who is alias husband jessica said faradn turned a measuring stare on idaho looked to the bashar what think you tyek the bashar apparently was having thoughts similar to those jessica professed he said i like her reasoning caution hes a gholamentat faradn said we could test him to the death and not find a certain answer but its a safe working assumption that we mayve been tricked tyekanik said jessica knew the moment had come to make her move now if idahos grief only kept him locked in the part hed chosen she disliked using him this way but there were larger considerations to begin with jessica said i might announce publicly that i came here of my own free choice interesting faradn said youd have to trust me and grant me the complete freedom of salusa secundus jessica said there could be no appearance that i spoke out of compulsion no wensicia protested faradn ignored her what reason would you give that im the sisterhoods plenipotentiary sent here to take over your education but the sisterhood accuses thatd require a decisive action from you jessica said dont trust her wensicia said with extreme politeness faradn glanced at her said if you interrupt me once more ill have tyek remove you he heard you consent to the formal investiture that binds him to me now shes a witch i tell you wensicia looked to the mute against the side wall faradn hesitated then tyek what think you have i been witched not in my judgment she youve both been witched mother his tone was flat and final wensicia clenched her fists tried to speak whirled and fled the room addressing himself once more to jessica faradn asked would the bene gesserit consent to this they would faradn absorbed the implications of this smiled tightly what does the sisterhood want in all of this your marriage to my granddaughter idaho shot a questioning look at jessica made as though to speak but remained silent jessica said you were going to say something duncan i was going to say that the bene gesserit want what theyve always wanted a universe which wont interfere with them an obvious assumption faradn said but i hardly see why you intrude with it idahos eyebrows managed the shrug which the shigawire would not permit his body disconcertingly he smiled faradn saw the smile whirled to confront idaho i amuse you this whole situation amuses me someone in your family has compromised the spacing guild by using them to carry instruments of assassination to arrakis instruments whose intent could not be concealed youve offended the bene gesserit by killing a male they wanted for their breeding pro you call me a liar ghola no i believe you didnt know about the plot but i thought the situation needed bringing into focus dont forget that hes a mentat jessica cautioned my very thought faradn said once more he faced jessica let us say that i free you and you make your announcement that still leaves the matter of your grandsons death the mentat is correct was it your mother jessica asked my lord tyekanik warned its all right tyek faradn waved a hand easily and if i say it was my mother risking everything in the test of this internal break among the corrino jessica said you must denounce her and banish her my lord tyekanik said there could be trickery within trickery here idaho said and the lady jessica and i are the ones whove been tricked faradns jaw hardened and jessica thought dont interfere duncan not now but idahos words had sent her own bene gesserit abilities at logic into motion he shocked her she began to wonder if there were the possibility that she was being used in ways she didnt understand ghanima and leto the preborn could draw upon countless inner experiences a storehouse of advice far more extensive than the living bene gesserit depended upon and there was that other question had her own sisterhood been completely candid with her they still might not trust her after all shed betrayed them once to her duke faradn looked at idaho with a puzzled frown mentat i need to know what this preacher is to you he arranged the passage here i we did not exchange ten words others acted for him he could be he could be paul atreides but i dont have enough data for certainty all i know for certain is that it was time for me to leave and he had the means you speak of being tricked faradn reminded him alia expects you to kill us quietly and conceal the evidence of it idaho said having rid her of the lady jessica im no longer useful and the lady jessica having served her sisterhoods purposes is no longer useful to them alia will be calling the bene gesserit to account but they will win jessica closed her eyes in concentration he was right she could hear the mentat firmness in his voice that deep sincerity of pronouncement the pattern fell into place without a chink she took two deep breaths and triggered the mnemonic trance rolled the data through her mind came out of the trance and opened her eyes it was done while faradn moved from in front of her to a position within half a step of idaho a space of no more than three steps say no more duncan jessica said and she thought mournfully of how leto had warned her against bene gesserit conditioning idaho about to speak closed his mouth i command here faradn said continue mentat idaho remained silent faradn half turned to study jessica she stared at a point on the far wall reviewing what idaho and the trance had built the bene gesserit hadnt abandoned the atreides line of course but they wanted control of a kwisatz haderach and theyd invested too much in the long breeding program they wanted the open clash between atreides and corrino a situation where they could step in as arbiters and duncan was right theyd emerge with control of both ghanima and faradn it was the only compromise possible the wonder was that alia hadnt seen it jessica swallowed past a tightness in her throat alia abomination ghanima was right to pity her but who was left to pity ghanima the sisterhood has promised to put you on the throne with ghanima as your mate jessica said faradn took a backward step did the witch read minds they worked secretly and not through your mother jessica said they told you i was not privy to their plan jessica read revelation in faradns face how open he was but it was true the whole structure idaho had demonstrated masterful abilities as a mentat in seeing through to the fabric on the limited data available to him so they played a double game and told you faradn said they told me nothing of this jessica said duncan was correct they tricked me she nodded to herself it had been a classic delaying action in the sisterhoods traditional pattern a reasonable story easily accepted because it squared with what one might believe of their motives but they wanted jessica out of the way a flawed sister whod failed them once tyekanik moved to faradns side my lord these two are too dangerous to wait a bit tyek faradn said there are wheels within wheels here he faced jessica weve had reasons to believe that alia might offer herself as my bride idaho gave an involuntary start controlled himself blood began dripping from his left wrist where the shigawire had cut jessica allowed herself a small eyewidening response she whod known the original leto as lover father of her children confidant and friend saw his trait of cold reasoning filtered now through the twistings of an abomination will you accept idaho asked it is being considered duncan i told you to be silent jessica said she addressed faradn her price was two inconsequential deaths the two of us we suspected treachery faradn said wasnt it your son who said treachery breeds treachery the sisterhood is out to control both atreides and corrino jessica said isnt that obvious were toying now with the idea of accepting your offer lady jessica but duncan idaho should be sent back to his loving wife pain is a function of nerves idaho reminded himself pain comes as light comes to the eyes effort comes from the muscles not from nerves it was an old mentat drill and he completed it in the space of one breath flexed his right wrist and severed an artery against the shigawire tyekanik leaped to the chair hit its trip lock to release the bindings shouted for medical aid it was revealing that assistants came swarming at once through doors hidden in wall panels there was always a bit of foolishness in duncan jessica thought faradn studied jessica a moment while the medics ministered to idaho i didnt say i was going to accept his alia thats not why he cut his wrist jessica said oh i thought he was simply removing himself youre not that stupid jessica said stop pretending with me he smiled im well aware that alia would destroy me not even the bene gesserit could expect me to accept her jessica bent a weighted stare upon faradn what was this young scion of house corrino he didnt play the fool well again she recalled letos words that shed encounter an interesting student and the preacher wanted this as well idaho said she wished shed met this preacher will you banish wensicia jessica asked it seems a reasonable bargain faradn said jessica glanced at idaho the medics had finished with him less dangerous restraints held him in the floater chair mentats should beware of absolutes she said im tired idaho said youve no idea how tired i am when its overexploited even loyalty wears out finally faradn said again jessica shot that measuring stare at him faradn seeing this thought in time shell know me for certain and that could be valuable a renegade bene gesserit of my own its the one thing her son had that i dont have let her get only a glimpse of me now she can see the rest later a fair exchange faradn said i accept your offer on your terms he signaled the mute against the wall with a complex flickering of fingers the mute nodded faradn bent to the chairs controls released jessica tyekanik asked my lord are you sure isnt it what we discussed faradn asked yes but faradn chuckled addressed jessica tyek suspects my sources but one learns from books and reels only that certain things can be done actual learning requires that you do those things jessica mused on this as she lifted herself from the chair her mind returned to faradns hand signals he had an atreidesstyle battle language it spoke of careful analysis someone here was consciously copying the atreides of course jessica said youll want me to teach you as the bene gesserit are taught faradn beamed at her the one offer i can not resist he said the password was given to me by a man who died in the dungeons of arrakeen you see that is where i got this ring in the shape of a tortoise it was in the suk outside the city where i was hidden by the rebels the password oh that has been changed many times since then it was persistence and the countersign was tortoise it got me out of there alive thats why i bought this ring a reminder tagir mohandis conversations with a friend leto was far out on the sand when he heard the worm behind him coming to his thumper there and the dusting of spice hed spread around the dead tigers there was a good omen for this beginning of their plan worms were scarce enough in these parts most times the worm was not essential but it helped there would be no need for ghanima to explain a missing body by this time he knew that ghanima had worked herself into the belief that he was dead only a tiny isolated capsule of awareness would remain to her a walledoff memory which could be recalled by words uttered in the ancient language shared only by the two of them in all of this universe secher nbiw if she heard those words golden path only then would she remember him until then he was dead now leto felt truly alone he moved with the random walk which made only those sounds natural to the desert nothing in his passage would tell that worm back there that human flesh moved here it was a way of walking so deeply conditioned in him that he didnt need to think about it the feet moved of themselves no measurable rhythm to their pacing any sound his feet made could be ascribed to the wind to gravity no human passed here when the worm had done its work behind him leto crouched behind a dunes slipface and peered back toward the attendant yes he was far enough he planted a thumper and summoned his transportation the worm came swiftly giving him barely enough time to position himself before it engulfed the thumper as it passed he went up its side on the maker hooks opened the sensitive leading edge of a ring and turned the mindless beast southeastward it was a small worm but strong he could sense the strength in its twisting as it hissed across the dunes there was a following breeze and he felt the heat of their passage the friction which the worm converted to the beginnings of spice within itself as the worm moved his mind moved stilgar had taken him up for his first worm journey leto had only to let his memory flow and he could hear stilgars voice calm and precise full of politeness from another age not for stilgar the threatening staggers of a fremen drunk on spiceliquor not for stilgar the loud voice and bluster of these times no stilgar had his duties he was an instructor of royalty in the olden times the birds were named for their songs each wind had its name a sixklick wind was called a pastaza a twentyklick wind was cueshma and a hundredklick wind was heinali heinali the manpusher then there was the wind of the demon in the open desert hulasikali wala the wind that eats flesh and leto whod already known these things had nodded his gratitude at the wisdom of such instruction but stilgars voice could be filled with many valuable things there were in olden times certain tribes which were known to be water hunters they were called iduali which meant water insects because those people wouldnt hesitate to steal the water of another fremen if they caught you alone in the desert they would not even leave you the water of your flesh there was this place where they lived sietch jacurutu thats where the other tribes banded and wiped out the iduali that was a long time ago before kynes even in my greatgreatgrandfathers days and from that day to this no fremen has gone to jacurutu it is tabu thus had leto been reminded of knowledge which lay in his memory it had been an important lesson about the working of memory a memory was not enough even for one whose past was as multiform as his unless its use was known and its value revealed to judgment jacurutu would have water a wind trap all of the attributes of a fremen sietch plus the value without compare that no fremen would venture there many of the young would not even know such a place as jacurutu had ever existed oh they would know about fondak of course but that was a smuggler place it was a perfect place for the dead to hide among the smugglers and the dead of another age thank you stilgar the worm tired before dawn leto slid off its side and watched it dig itself into the dunes moving slowly in the familiar pattern of the creatures it would go deep and sulk i must wait out the day he thought he stood atop a dune and scanned all around emptiness emptiness emptiness only the wavering track of the vanished worm broke the pattern the slow cry of a nightbird challenged the first green line of light along the eastern horizon leto dug himself into the sands concealment inflated a stilltent around his body and sent the tip of a sandsnorkel questing for air for a long time before sleep came he lay in the enforced darkness thinking about the decision he and ghanima had made it had not been an easy decision especially for ghanima he had not told her all of his vision nor all of the reasoning derived from it it was a vision not a dream in his thinking now but the peculiarity of this thing was that he saw it as a vision of a vision if any argument existed to convince him that his father still lived it lay in that visionvision the life of the prophet locks us into his vision leto thought and a prophet could only break out of the vision by creating his death at variance with that vision that was how it appeared in letos doubled vision and he pondered this as it related to the choice he had made poor baptist john he thought if hed only had the courage to die some other way but perhaps his choice had been the bravest one how do i know what alternatives faced him i know what alternatives faced my father though leto sighed to turn his back on his father was like betraying a god but the atreides empire needed shaking up it had fallen into the worst of pauls vision how casually it obliterated men it was done without a second thought the mainspring of a religious insanity had been wound tight and left ticking and were locked in my fathers vision a way out of that insanity lay along the golden path leto knew his father had seen it but humanity might come out of that golden path and look back down it at muaddibs time seeing that as a better age humankind had to experience the alternative to muaddib though or never understand its own myths security peace prosperity given the choice there was little doubt what most citizens of this empire would select though they hate me he thought though ghani hate me his right hand itched and he thought of the terrible glove in his visionvision it will be he thought yes it will be arrakis give me strength he prayed his planet remained strong and alive beneath him and around him its sand pressed close against the stilltent dune was a giant counting its massed riches it was a beguiling entity both beautiful and grossly ugly the only coin its merchants really knew was the bloodpulse of their own power no matter how that power had been amassed they possessed this planet the way a man might possess a captive mistress or the way the bene gesserits possessed their sisters no wonder stilgar hated the merchantpriests thank you stilgar leto recalled then the beauties of the old sietch ways the life lived before the coming of the imperiums technocracy and his mind flowed as he knew stilgars dreams flowed before the glowglobes and lasers before the ornithopters and spicecrawlers thered been another kind of life brownskinned mothers with babies on their hips lamps which burned spiceoil amidst a heavy fragrance of cinnamon naibs who persuaded their people while knowing none could be compelled it had been a darkswarming of life in rocky burrows a terrible glove will restore the balance leto thought presently he slept i saw his blood and a piece of his robe which had been ripped by sharp claws his sister reports vividly of the tigers the sureness of their attack we have questioned one of the plotters and others are dead or in custody everything points to a corrino plot a truthsayer has attested to this testimony stilgars report to the landsraad commission faradn studied duncan idaho through the spy circuit seeking a clue to that strange mans behavior it was shortly after noon and idaho waited outside the quarters assigned to the lady jessica seeking audience with her would she see him shed know they were spied upon of course but would she see him around faradn lay the room where tyekanik had guided the training of the laza tigers an illegal room really filled as it was with forbidden instruments from the hands of the tleilaxu and ixians by the movement of switches at his right hand faradn could look at idaho from six different angles or shift to the interior of the lady jessicas suite where the spying facilities were equally sophisticated idahos eyes bothered faradn those pitted metal orbs which the tleilaxu had given their ghola in the regrowth tanks marked their possessor as profoundly different from other humans faradn touched his own eyelids feeling the hard surfaces of the permanent contact lenses which concealed the total blue of his spice addiction idahos eyes must record a different universe how could it be otherwise it almost tempted faradn to seek out the tleilaxu surgeons and answer that question himself why did idaho try to kill himself was that really what hed tried he mustve known we wouldnt permit it idaho remained a dangerous question mark tyekanik wanted to keep him on salusa or kill him perhaps that would be best faradn shifted to a frontal view idaho sat on a hard bench outside the door to the lady jessicas suite it was a windowless foyer with light wood walls decorated by lance pennants idaho had been on that bench more than an hour and appeared ready to wait there forever faradn bent close to the screen the loyal swordmaster of the atreides instructor of paul muaddib had been treated kindly by his years on arrakis hed arrived with a youthful spring in his step a steady spice diet must have helped him of course and that marvelous metabolic balance which the tleilaxu tanks always imparted did idaho really remember his past before the tanks no other whom the tleilaxu had revived could claim this what an enigma this idaho was the reports of his death were in the library the sardaukar whod slain him reported his prowess nineteen of their number dispatched by idaho before hed fallen nineteen sardaukar his flesh had been well worth sending to the regrowth tanks but the tleilaxu had made a mentat out of him what a strange creature lived in that regrown flesh how did it feel to be a human computer in addition to all of his other talents why did he try to kill himself faradn knew his own talents and held few illusions about them he was a historianarchaeologist and judge of men necessity had forced him to become an expert on those who would serve him necessity and a careful study of the atreides he saw it as the price always demanded of aristocracy to rule required accurate and incisive judgments about those who wielded your power more than one ruler had fallen through mistakes and excesses of his underlings careful study of the atreides revealed a superb talent in choosing servants theyd known how to maintain loyalty how to keep a fine edge on the ardor of their warriors idaho was not acting in character why faradn squinted his eyes trying to see past the skin of this man there was a sense of duration about idaho a feeling that he could not be worn down he gave the impression of being selfcontained an organized and firmly integrated whole the tleilaxu tanks had set something more than human into motion faradn sensed this there was a selfrenewing movement about the man as though he acted in accordance with immutable laws beginning anew at every ending he moved in a fixed orbit with an endurance about him like that of a planet around a star he would respond to pressure without breaking merely shifting his orbit slightly but not really changing anything basic why did he cut his wrist whatever his motive he had done it for the atreides for his ruling house the atreides were the star of his orbit somehow he believes that my holding the lady jessica here strengthens the atreides and faradn reminded himself a mentat thinks this it gave the thought an added depth mentats made mistakes but not often having come to this conclusion faradn almost summoned his aides to have them send the lady jessica away with idaho he poised himself on the point of acting withdrew both of those people the gholamentat and the bene gesserit witch remained counters of unknown denomination in this game of power idaho must be sent back because that would certainly stir up troubles on arrakis jessica must be kept here drained of her strange knowledge to benefit house corrino faradn knew it was a subtle and deadly game he played but he had prepared himself for this possibility over the years ever since hed realized that he was more intelligent more sensitive than those around him it had been a frightening discovery for a child and he knew the library had been his refuge as well as his teacher doubts ate at him now though and he wondered if he was quite up to this game hed alienated his mother lost her counsel but her decisions had always been dangerous to him tigers their training had been an atrocity and their use had been stupidity how easy they were to trace she should be thankful to suffer nothing more than banishment the lady jessicas advice had fitted his needs with a lovely precision there she must be made to divulge the way of that atreides thinking his doubts began to fade away he thought of his sardaukar once more growing tough and resilient through the rigorous training and the denial of luxury which he commanded his sardaukar legions remained small but once more they were a mantoman match for the fremen that served little purpose as long as the limits imposed by the treaty of arrakeen governed the relative size of the forces fremen could overwhelm him by their numbers unless they were tied up and weakened by civil war it was too soon for a battle of sardaukar against fremen he needed time he needed new allies from among the discontented houses major and the newly powerful from the houses minor he needed access to choam financing he needed the time for his sardaukar to grow stronger and the fremen to grow weaker again faradn looked at the screen which revealed the patient ghola why did idaho want to see the lady jessica at this time he would know they were spied upon that every word every gesture would be recorded and analyzed why faradn glanced away from the screen to the ledge beside his control console in the pale electronic light he could make out the spools which contained the latest reports from arrakis his spies were thorough he had to give them credit there was much to give him hope and pleasure in those reports he closed his eyes and the high points of those reports passed through his mind in the oddly editorial form to which hed reduced the spools for his own uses as the planet is made fertile fremen are freed of land pressures and their new communities lose the traditional sietchstronghold character from infancy in the old sietch culture the fremen was taught by the rota like the knowledge of your own being the sietch forms a firm base from which you move out into the world and into the universe the traditional fremen says look to the massif meaning that the master science is the law but the new social structure is loosening those old legal restrictions discipline grows lax the new fremen leaders know only their low catechism of ancestry plus the history which is camouflaged in the myth structure of their songs people of the new communities are more volatile more open they quarrel more often and are less responsive to authority the old sietch folk are more disciplined more inclined to group actions and they tend to work harder they are more careful of their resources the old folk still believe that the orderly society is the fulfillment of the individual the young grow away from this belief those remnants of the older culture which remain look at the young and say the death wind has etched away their past faradn liked the pointedness of his own summary the new diversity on arrakis could only bring violence he had the essential concepts firmly etched into the spools the religion of muaddib is based firmly in the old fremen sietch cultural tradition while the new culture moves farther and farther from those disciplines not for the first time faradn asked himself why tyekanik had embraced that religion tyekanik behaved oddly in his new morality he seemed utterly sincere but carried along as though against his will tyekanik was like one who had stepped into the whirlwind to test it and had been caught up by forces beyond his control tyekaniks conversion annoyed faradn by its characterless completeness it was a reversion to very old sardaukar ways he warned that the young fremen might yet revert in a similar way that the inborn ingrained traditions would prevail once more faradn thought about those report spools they told of a disquieting thing the persistence of a cultural remnant from the most ancient fremen times the water of conception the amniotic fluid of the newborn was saved at birth distilled into the first water fed to that child the traditional form required a godmother to serve the water saying here is the water of thy conception even the young fremen still followed this tradition with their own newborn the water of thy conception faradn found himself revolted by the idea of drinking water distilled from the amniotic fluid which had borne him and he thought about the surviving twin ghanima her mother dead when shed taken that strange water had she reflected later upon that odd link with her past probably not shed been raised fremen what was natural and acceptable to fremen had been natural and acceptable to her momentarily faradn regretted the death of leto ii it would have been interesting to discuss this point with him perhaps an opportunity would come to discuss it with ghanima why did idaho cut his wrists the question persisted every time he glanced at the spy screen again doubts assailed faradn he longed for the ability to sink into the mysterious spice trance as paul muaddib had done there to seek out the future and know the answers to his questions no matter how much spice he ingested though his ordinary awareness persisted in its singular flow of now reflecting a universe of uncertainties the spy screen showed a servant opening the lady jessicas door the woman beckoned idaho who arose from the bench and went through the door the servant would file a complete report later but faradn his curiosity once more fully aroused touched another switch on his console watched as idaho entered the sitting room of the lady jessicas quarters how calm and contained the mentat appeared and how fathomless were his ghola eyes above all else the mentat must be a generalist not a specialist it is wise to have decisions of great moment monitored by generalists experts and specialists lead you quickly into chaos they are a source of useless nit picking the ferocious quibble over a comma the mentatgeneralist on the other hand should bring to decisionmaking a healthy common sense he must not cut himself off from the broad sweep of what is happening in his universe he must remain capable of saying theres no real mystery about this at the moment this is what we want now it may prove wrong later but well correct that when we come to it the mentatgeneralist must understand that anything which we can identify as our universe is merely part of larger phenomena but the expert looks backward he looks into the narrow standards of his own specialty the generalist looks outward he looks for living principles knowing full well that such principles change that they develop it is to the characteristics of change itself that the mentatgeneralist must look there can be no permanent catalogue of such change no handbook or manual you must look at it with as few preconceptions as possible asking yourself now what is this thing doing the mentat handbook it was the day of the kwisatz haderach the first holy day of those who followed muaddib it recognized the deified paul atreides as that person who was everywhere simultaneously the male bene gesserit who mingled both male and female ancestry in an inseparable power to become the onewithall the faithful called this day ayil the sacrifice to commemorate the death which made his presence real in all places the preacher chose the early morning of this day to appear once more in the plaza of alias temple defying the order for his arrest which everyone knew had been issued the delicate truce prevailed between alias priesthood and those desert tribes which had rebelled but the presence of this truce could be felt as a tangible thing which moved everyone in arrakeen with uneasiness the preacher did not dispel that mood it was the twentyeighth day of official mourning for muaddibs son six days following the memorial rite at old pass which had been delayed by the rebellion even the fighting had not stopped the hajj though the preacher knew the plaza would be heavily thronged on this day most pilgrims tried to time their stay on arrakis to cross ayil to feel then the holy presence of the kwisatz haderach on his day the preacher entered the plaza at first light finding the place already thronging with the faithful he kept a hand lightly on the shoulder of his young guide sensing the cynical pride in the lads walk now when the preacher approached people noticed every nuance of his behavior such attention was not entirely distasteful to the young guide the preacher merely accepted it as a necessity taking his stance on the third of the temples steps the preacher waited for the hush to come when silence had spread like a wave through the throng and the hurrying footsteps of others come to listen could be heard at the plazas limits he cleared his throat it was still morningcold around him and lights had not yet come down into the plaza from the building tops he felt the grey hush of the great square as he began to speak i have come to give homage and to preach in the memory of leto atreides ii he said calling out in that strong voice so reminiscent of a wormsman from the desert i do it in compassion for all who suffer i say to you what the dead leto has learned that tomorrow has not yet happened and may never happen this moment here is the only observable time and place for us in our universe i tell you to savor this moment and understand what it teaches i tell you to learn that a governments growth and its death are apparent in the growth and death of its citizens a disturbed murmur passed through the plaza did he mock the death of leto ii they wondered if priest guards would rush out now and arrest the preacher alia knew there would be no such interruption of the preacher it was her order that he be left unmolested on this day she had disguised herself in a good stillsuit with a moisture mask to conceal her nose and mouth and a common hooded robe to hide her hair she stood in the second row beneath the preacher watching him carefully was this paul the years might have changed him thus and he had always been superb with voice a fact which made it difficult to identify him by his speech still this preacher made his voice do what he wanted paul could not have done it better she felt that she had to know his identity before she could act against him how his words dazzled her she sensed no irony in the preachers statement he was using the seductive attraction of definite sentences uttered with a driving sincerity people might stumble only momentarily at his meanings realizing that he had meant them to stumble teaching them in this fashion indeed he picked up the crowds response saying irony often masks the inability to think beyond ones assumptions i am not being ironic ghanima has said to you that the blood of her brother can not be washed off i concur it will be said that leto has gone where his father went has done what his father did muaddibs church says he chose in behalf of his own humanity a course which might appear absurd and foolhardy but which history will validate that history is being rewritten even now i say to you that there is another lesson to be learned from these lives and their endings alia alert to every nuance asked herself why the preacher said endings instead of deaths was he saying that one or both were not truly dead how could that be a truthsayer had confirmed ghanimas story what was this preacher doing then was he making a statement of myth or reality note this other lesson well the preacher thundered lifting his arms if you would possess your humanity let go of the universe he lowered his arms pointed his empty sockets directly at alia he seemed to be speaking intimately to her an action so obvious that several around her turned to peer inquiringly in her direction alia shivered at the power in him this could be paul it could but i realize that humans can not bear very much reality he said most lives are a flight from selfhood most prefer the truths of the stable you stick your heads into the stanchions and munch contentedly until you die others use you for their purposes not once do you live outside the stable to lift your head and be your own creature muaddib came to tell you about that without understanding his message you can not revere him some in the throng possibly a priest in disguise could stand no more his hoarse male voice was lifted in a shout you dont live the life of muaddib how dare you to tell others how they must revere him because hes dead the preacher bellowed alia turned to see who had challenged the preacher the man remained hidden from her but his voice came over the intervening heads in another shout if you believe him truly dead then you are alone from this time forward surely it was a priest alia thought but she failed to recognize the voice i come only to ask a simple question the preacher said is muaddibs death to be followed by the moral suicide of all men is that the inevitable aftermath of a messiah then you admit him messiah the voice from the crowd shouted why not since im the prophet of his times the preacher asked there was such calm assurance in his tone and manner that even his challenger fell silent the crowd responded with a disturbed murmur a low animal sound yes the preacher repeated i am the prophet of these times alia concentrating on him detected the subtle inflections of voice hed certainly controlled the crowd was he bene gesserit trained was this another ploy of the missionaria protectiva not paul at all but just another part of the endless power game i articulate the myth and the dream the preacher shouted i am the physician who delivers the child and announces that the child is born yet i come to you at a time of death does that not disturb you it should shake your souls even as she felt anger at his words alia understood the pointed way of his speech with others she found herself edging closer up the steps crowding toward this tall man in desert garb his young guide caught her attention how brighteyed and saucy the lad appeared would muaddib employ such a cynical youth i mean to disturb you the preacher shouted it is my intention i come here to combat the fraud and illusion of your conventional institutionalized religion as with all such religions your institution moves toward cowardice it moves toward mediocrity inertia and selfsatisfaction angry murmurs began to arise in the center of the throng alia felt the tensions and gloatingly wondered if there might not be a riot could the preacher handle these tensions if not he could die right here that priest who challenged me the preacher called pointing into the crowd he knows alia thought a thrill ran through her almost sexual in its undertones this preacher played a dangerous game but he played it consummately you priest in your mufti the preacher called you are a chaplain to the selfsatisfied i come not to challenge muaddib but to challenge you is your religion real when it costs you nothing and carries no risk is your religion real when you fatten upon it is your religion real when you commit atrocities in its name whence comes your downward degeneration from the original revelation answer me priest but the challenger remained silent and alia noted that the crowd once more was listening with avid submission to the preachers every word by attacking the priesthood he had their sympathy and if her spies were correct most of the pilgrims and fremen on arrakis believed this man was muaddib the son of muaddib risked the preacher shouted and alia heard tears in his voice muaddib risked they paid their price and what did muaddib achieve a religion which is doing away with him how different those words if they come from paul himself alia thought i must find out she moved closer up the steps and others moved with her she pressed through the throng until she could almost reach out and touch this mysterious prophet she smelled the desert on him a mixture of spice and flint both the preacher and his young guide were dusty as though theyd recently come from the bled she could see where the preachers hands were deeply veined along the skin protruding from the wrist seals of his stillsuit she could see that one finger of his left hand had worn a ring the indentation remained paul had worn a ring on that finger the atreides hawk which now reposed in sietch tabr leto would have worn it had he lived or had she permitted him to ascend the throne again the preacher aimed his empty sockets at alia spoke intimately but with a voice which carried across the throng muaddib showed you two things a certain future and an uncertain future with full awareness he confronted the ultimate uncertainty of the larger universe he stepped off blindly from his position on this world he showed us that men must do this always choosing the uncertain instead of the certain his voice alia noted took on a pleading tone at the end of this statement alia glanced around slipped a hand onto the hilt of her crysknife if i killed him right now what would they do again she felt a thrill rush through her if i killed him and revealed myself denouncing the preacher as impostor and heretic but what if they proved it was paul someone pushed alia even closer to him she felt herself enthralled by his presence even as she fought to still her anger was this paul gods below what could she do why has another leto been taken from us the preacher demanded there was real pain in his voice answer me if you can ahhhh their message is clear abandon certainty he repeated it in a rolling stentorian shout abandon certainty thats lifes deepest command thats what lifes all about were a probe into the unknown into the uncertain why cant you hear muaddib if certainty is knowing absolutely an absolute future then thats only death disguised such a future becomes now he showed you this with a terrifying directness the preacher reached out grabbed alias arm it was done without any groping or hesitation she tried to pull away but he held her in a painful grip speaking directly into her face as those around them edged back in confusion what did paul atreides tell you woman he demanded how does he know im a woman she asked herself she wanted to sink into her inner lives ask their protection but the world within remained frighteningly silent mesmerized by this figure from their past he told you that completion equals death the preacher shouted absolute prediction is completion is death she tried to pry his fingers away she wanted to grab her knife and slash him away from her but dared not she had never felt this daunted in all of her life the preacher lifted his chin to speak over her to the crowd shouted i give you muaddibs words he said im going to rub your faces in things you try to avoid i dont find it strange that all you want to believe is only that which comforts you how else do humans invent the traps which betray us into mediocrity how else do we define cowardice thats what muaddib told you abruptly he released alias arm thrust her into the crowd she would have fallen but for the press of people supporting her to exist is to stand out away from the background the preacher said you arent thinking or really existing unless youre willing to risk even your own sanity in the judgment of your existence stepping down the preacher once more took alias arm no faltering or hesitation he was gentler this time though leaning close he pitched his voice for her ears alone said stop trying to pull me once more into the background sister then hand on his young guides shoulder he stepped into the throng way was made for the strange pair hands reached out to touch the preacher but people reached with an awesome tenderness fearful of what they might find beneath that dusty fremen robe alia stood alone in her shock as the throng moved out behind the preacher certainty filled her it was paul no doubt remained it was her brother she felt what the crowd felt she had stood in the sacred presence and now her universe tumbled all about her she wanted to run after him pleading for him to save her from herself but she could not move while others pressed to follow the preacher and his guide she stood intoxicated with an absolute despair a distress so deep that she could only tremble with it unable to command her own muscles what will i do what will i do she asked herself now she did not even have duncan to lean upon nor her mother the inner lives remained silent there was ghanima held securely under guard within the keep but alia could not bring herself to take this distress to the surviving twin everyone has turned against me what can i do the oneeyed view of our universe says you must not look far afield for problems such problems may never arrive instead tend to the wolf within your fences the packs ranging outside may not even exist the azhar book shamra i jessica awaited idaho at the window of her sitting room it was a comfortable room with soft divans and oldfashioned chairs there wasnt a suspensor in any of her rooms and the glowglobes were crystal from another age her window overlooked a courtyard garden one story down she heard the servant open the door then the sound of idahos footsteps on the wood floor then on the carpet she listened without turning kept her gaze upon the dappled light of the courtyards green floor the silent fearful warfare of her emotions must be suppressed now she took the deep breaths of her pranabindu training felt the outflow of enforced calmness the high sun threw its searchlight along a dustbeam into the courtyard highlighting the silver wheel of a spiderweb stretched in the branches of a linden tree which reached almost to her window it was cool within her quarters but outside the sealed window there was air which trembled with petrified heat castle corrino sat in a stagnant place which belied the greens in her courtyard she heard idaho stop directly behind her without turning she said the gift of words is the gift of deception and illusion duncan why do you wish words with me it may be that only one of us will survive he said and you wish me to make a good report of your efforts she turned saw how calmly he stood there watching her with those grey metal eyes which held no center of focus how blank they were duncan is it possible that youre jealous of your place in history she spoke accusingly and remembered as she spoke that other time when shed confronted this man hed been drunk then set to spy upon her and was torn by conflicting obligations but that had been a preghola duncan this was not the same man at all this one was not divided in his actions not torn he proved her summation by smiling history holds its own court and delivers its own judgments he said i doubt that ill be concerned when my judgments handed down why are you here she asked for the same reason youre here my lady no outward sign betrayed the shocking power of those simple words but she reflected at a furious pace does he really know why im here how could he only ghanima knew then had he enough data for a mentat computation that was possible and what if he said something to give her away would he do that if he shared her reason for being here he must know their every movement every word was being spied upon by faradn or his servants house atreides has come to a bitter crossroads she said family turned against itself you were among my dukes most loyal men duncan when the baron harkonnen let us not speak of harkonnens he said that was another age and your duke is dead and he wondered cant she guess that paul revealed the harkonnen blood in the atreides what a risk that had been for paul but it had bound duncan idaho even more firmly to him the trust in the revelation had been a coin almost too great to imagine paul had known what the barons people had done to idaho house atreides is not dead jessica said what is house atreides he asked are you house atreides is it alia ghanima is it the people who serve this house i look at those people and they bear the stamp of a travail beyond words how can they be atreides your son said it rightly travail and persecution are the lot of all who follow me i would break myself away from that my lady have you really gone over to faradn isnt that what youve done my lady didnt you come here to convince faradn that a marriage to ghanima would solve all of our problems does he really think that she wondered or is he talking for the watchful spies house atreides has always been essentially an idea she said you know that duncan we bought loyalty with loyalty service to the people idaho sneered ahhh manys the time ive heard your duke say it he must lie uneasy in his grave my lady do you really think us fallen that low my lady did you not know that there are fremen rebels they call themselves marquis of the inner desert who curse house atreides and even muaddib i heard faradns report she said wondering where he was leading this conversation and to what point more than that my lady more than faradns report ive heard their curse myself heres the way of it burning be on you atreides you shall have no souls nor spirits nor bodies nor shades nor magic nor bones nor hair nor utterances nor words you shall have no grave nor house nor hole nor tomb you shall have no garden nor tree nor bush you shall have no water nor bread nor light nor fire you shall have no children nor family nor heirs nor tribe you shall have no head nor arms nor legs nor gait nor seed you shall have no seats on any planet your souls shall not be permitted to come up from the depths and they shall never be among those permitted to live upon the earth on no day shall you behold shaihulud but you shall be bound and fettered in the nethermost abomination and your souls shall never enter into the glorious light for ever and ever thats the way of the curse my lady can you imagine such hatred from fremen they consign all atreides to the left hand of the damned to the womansun which is full of burning jessica allowed herself a shudder idaho undoubtedly had delivered those words with the same voice in which hed heard the original curse why did he expose this to house corrino she could picture an outraged fremen terrible in his anger standing before his tribe to vent that ancient curse why did idaho want faradn to hear it you make a strong argument for the marriage of ghanima and faradn she said you always did have a singleminded approach to problems he said ghanimas fremen she can marry only one who pays no fai no tax for protection house corrino gave up its entire choam holdings to your son and his heirs faradn exists on atreides sufferance and remember when your duke planted the hawk flag on arrakis remember what he said here i am here i remain his bones are still there and faradn would have to live on arrakis his sardaukar with him idaho shook his head at the very thought of such an alliance theres an old saying that one peels a problem like an onion she said her voice cold how dare he patronize me unless hes performing for faradns watchful eyes somehow i cant see fremen and sardaukar sharing a planet idaho said thats a layer which doesnt come off the onion she didnt like the thoughts which idahos words might arouse in faradn and his advisors spoke sharply house atreides is still the law in this empire and she thought does idaho want faradn to believe he can regain the throne without the atreides oh yes idaho said i almost forgot atreides law as translated of course by the priests of the golden elixir i have but to close my eyes and i hear your duke telling me that real estate is always gained and held by violence or the threat of it fortune passes everywhere as gurney used to sing it the end justifies the means or do i have my proverbs mixed up well it doesnt matter whether the mailed fist is brandished openly by fremen legions or sardaukar or whether its hidden in the atreides law the fist is still there and the onion layer wont come off my lady you know i wonder which fist faradn will demand what is he doing jessica wondered house corrino would soak up this argument and gloat over it so you think the priests wouldnt let ghanima marry faradn jessica ventured probing to see where idahos words might be leading let her gods below the priests will let alia do whatever she decrees she could marry faradn herself is that where hes fishing jessica wondered no my lady idaho said thats not the issue this empires people can not distinguish between atreides government and the government of beast rabban men die every day in arrakeens dungeons i left because i could not give my sword arm another hour to the atreides dont you understand what im saying why i came here to you as the nearest atreides representative the atreides empire has betrayed your duke and your son i loved your daughter but she went one way and i went another if it comes down to it ill advise faradn to accept ghanimas hand or alias only on his own terms ahhh he sets the stage for a formal withdrawal with honor from atreides service she thought but these other matters of which he spoke could he possibly know how well they did her work for her she scowled at him you know spies are listening to every word dont you spies he chuckled they listen as i would listen in their place dont you know how my loyalties move in a different way manys the night ive spent alone in the desert and the fremen are right about that place in the desert especially at night you encounter the dangers of hard thinking is that where you heard fremen curse us yes among the alourouba at the preachers bidding i joined them my lady we call ourselves the zarr sadus those who refuse to submit to the priests i am here to make formal announcement to an atreides that ive removed myself to enemy territory jessica studied him looking for betrayals of minutiae but idaho gave no indication that he spoke falsely or with hidden plans was it really possible that hed gone over to faradn she was reminded of her sisterhoods maxim in human affairs nothing remains enduring all human affairs revolve in a helix moving around and out if idaho had really left the atreides fold that would explain his present behavior he was moving around and out she had to consider this as a possibility but why had he emphasized that he did the preachers bidding jessicas mind raced and having considered alternatives she realized she might have to kill idaho the plan upon which she had staked her hopes remained so delicate that nothing could be allowed to interfere with it nothing and idahos words hinted that he knew her plan she gauged their relative positions in the room moving and turning to place herself in position for a lethal blow ive always considered the normalizing effect of the faufreluches to be a pillar of our strength she said let him wonder why she shifted their conversation to the system of class distinction the landsraad council of the great houses the regional sysselraads all deserve our you do not distract me he said and idaho wondered at how transparent her actions had become was it that she had grown lax in concealment or had he finally breached the walls of her bene gesserit training the latter he decided but some of it was in herself a changing as she aged it saddened him to see the small ways the new fremen differed from the old the passing of the desert was the passing of something precious to humans and he could not describe this thing no more than he could describe what had happened to the lady jessica jessica stared at idaho in open astonishment not trying to conceal her reaction could he read her that easily you will not slay me he said he used the fremen words of warning dont throw your blood upon my knife and he thought ive become very much the fremen it gave him a wry sense of continuity to realize how deeply he had accepted the ways of the planet which had harbored his second life i think youd better leave she said not until you accept my withdrawal from atreides service accepted she bit it off and only after shed uttered the word did she realize how much pure reflex had gone into this exchange she needed time to think and reconsider how had idaho known what she would do she did not believe him capable of leaping time in the spice way idaho backed away from her until he felt the door behind him he bowed once more i call you my lady and then never again my advice to faradn will be to send you back to wallach quietly and quickly at the earliest practical moment you are too dangerous a toy to keep around although i dont believe he thinks of you as a toy you are working for the sisterhood not for the atreides i wonder now if you ever worked for the atreides you witches move too deeply and darkly for mere mortals ever to trust a ghola considers himself a mere mortal she jibed compared to you he said leave she ordered such is my intention he slipped out the door passing the curious stare of the servant whod obviously been listening its done he thought and they can read it in only one way only in the realm of mathematics can you understand muaddibs precise view of the future thus first we postulate any number of pointdimensions in space this is the classic nfold extended aggregate of n dimensions with this framework time as commonly understood becomes an aggregate of onedimensional properties applying this to the muaddib phenomenon we find that we either are confronted by new properties of time or by reduction through the infinity calculus we are dealing with separate systems which contain n body properties for muaddib we assume the latter as demonstrated by the reduction the point dimensions of the nfold can only have separate existence within different frameworks of time separate dimensions of time are thus demonstrated to coexist this being the inescapable case muaddibs predictions required that he perceive the nfold not as extended aggregate but as an operation within a single framework in effect he froze his universe into that one framework which was his view of time palimbasha lectures at sietch tabr leto lay at the crest of a dune peering across open sand at a sinuous rock outcropping the rock lay like an immense worm atop the sand flat and threatening in the morning sunlight nothing stirred there no bird circled overhead no animal scampered among the rocks he would see the slots of a windtrap almost at the center of the worms back thered be water here the rockworm held the familiar appearance of a sietch shelter except for the absence of living things he lay quietly blending with sand watching one of gurney hallecks tunes kept flowing through his mind monotonously persistent beneath the hill where the fox runs lightly a dappled sun shines brightly where my one loves still beneath the hill in the fennel brake i spy my love who can not wake he hides in a grave beneath the hill where was the entrance to that place leto wondered he felt the certainty that this must be jacurutufondak but there was something wrong here beyond the lack of animal movement something flickered at the edges of conscious perception warning him what hid beneath the hill lack of animals was bothersome it aroused his fremen sense of caution the absence says more than the presence when it comes to desert survival but there was a windtrap there would be water and humans to use it this was the tabu place which hid behind fondaks name its other identity lost even to the memories of most fremen and no birds or animals could be seen there no humans yet here the golden path began his father had once said theres unknown all around at every moment thats where you seek knowledge leto glanced out to his right along the dune crests thered been a mother storm recently lake azrak the gypsum plain had been exposed from beneath its sandy cover fremen superstition said that whoever saw the biyan the white lands was granted a twoedged wish a wish which might destroy you leto saw only a gypsum plain which told him that open water had existed once here on arrakis as it would exist once more he peered upward swinging his gaze all around in the search for movement the sky was porous after the storm light passing through it generated a sensation of milky presence of a silver sun lost somewhere above the dust veil which persisted in the high altitudes once more leto brought his attention back to the sinuous rock he slipped the binoculars from his fremkit focused their motile lenses and peered at the naked greyness this outcropping where once the men of jacurutu had lived amplification revealed a thorn bush the one called queen of night the bush nestled in shadows at a cleft which might be an entrance into the old sietch he scanned the length of the outcropping the silver sun turned reds into grey casting a diffuse flatness over the long expanse of rock he rolled over turning his back on jacurutu scanned the circle of his surroundings through the binoculars nothing in that wilderness preserved the marks of human passage the wind already had obliterated his tracks leaving only a vague roundness where he had dropped from his worm in the night again he looked at jacurutu except for the windtrap there was no sign that men had ever passed this way and without that sinuous length of rock there was nothing here to subtract from the bleached sand a wilderness from horizon to horizon leto felt suddenly that he was in this place because he had refused to be confined in the system which his ancestors bequeathed him he thought of how people looked at him that universal mistake in every glance except ghanimas except for that ragged mob of other memories this child was never a child i must accept responsibility for the decision we made he thought once more he scanned the length of rock by all the descriptions this had to be fondak and no other place could be jacurutu he felt a strange resonant relationship with the tabu of this place in the bene gesserit way he opened his mind to jacurutu seeking to know nothing about it knowing was a barrier which prevented learning for a few moments he allowed himself merely to resonate making no demands asking no questions the problem lay within the lack of animal life but it was a particular thing which alerted him he perceived it then there were no scavenger birds no eagles no vultures no hawks even when other life hid these remained every watering place in this desert held its chain of life at the end of the chain were the omnipresent scavengers nothing had come to investigate his presence how well he knew the watchdogs of the sietch that line of crouched birds on the cliffs edge at tabr primitive undertakers waiting for flesh as the fremen said our competitors but they said it with no sense of jealousy because questing birds often told when strangers approached what if this fondak has been abandoned even by the smugglers leto paused to drink from one of his catchtubes what if theres truly no water here he reviewed his position hed run two worms into the sand getting here riding them with his flail through the night leaving them halfdead this was the inner desert where the smugglers haven was to be found if life existed here if it could exist it would have to be in the presence of water what if theres no water what if this isnt fondakjacurutu once more he aimed his binoculars at the windtrap its outer edges were sandetched in need of maintenance but enough of it remained there should be water but what if there isnt an abandoned sietch might lose its water to the air to any number of catastrophes why were there no scavenger birds killed for their water by whom how could all of them be eliminated poison poisoned water the legend of jacurutu contained no story of the cistern poisoned but it might have been if the original flocks were slain would they not have been renewed by this time the iduali were wiped out generations ago and the stories never mentioned poison again he examined the rock with his binoculars how could an entire sietch have been wiped out certainly some must have escaped all of the inhabitants of a sietch were seldom at home parties roamed the desert trekked to the towns with a sigh of resignation leto put away his binoculars he slipped down the hidden face of the dune took extra care to dig in his stilltent and conceal all sign of his intrusion as he prepared to spend the hot hours the sluggish currents of fatigue stole along his limbs as he sealed himself in the darkness within the tents sweaty confines he spent much of the day drowsing imagining mistakes he could have made his dreams were defensive but there could be no selfdefense in this trial he and ghanima had chosen failure would scald their souls he ate spicebiscuits and slept awakened to eat once more to drink and return to sleep it had been a long journey to this place a severe test for the muscles of a child toward evening he awoke refreshed listened for signs of life he crept out of his sandy shroud there was dust high up in the sky blowing one way but he could feel sand stinging his cheek from another direction sure sign there would be a weather change he sensed a storm coming cautiously he crept to the crest of his dune peered once more at those enigmatic rocks the intervening air was yellow the signs spoke of a coriolis storm approaching the wind that carried death in its belly thered be a great winding sheet of winddriven sand that might stretch across four degrees of latitude the desolate emptiness of the gypsum pan was a yellow surface now reflecting the dust clouds the false peace of evening enfolded him then the day collapsed and it was night the quick night of the inner desert the rocks were transformed into angular peaks frosted by the light of first moon he felt sandthorns stinging his skin a peal of dry thunder sounded like an echo from distant drums and in the space between moonlight and darkness he saw sudden movement bats he could hear the stirring of their wings their tiny squeaks bats by design or accident this place conveyed a sense of abandoned desolation it was where the halflegendary smuggler stronghold should be fondak but what if it were not fondak what if the tabu still ruled and this were only the shell of ghostly jacurutu leto crouched in the lee of his dune and waited for the night to settle into its own rhythms patience and caution caution and patience for a time he amused himself by reviewing chaucers route from london to canterbury listing the places from southwark two miles to the wateringplace of st thomas five miles to deptford six miles to greenwich thirty miles to rochester forty miles to sittingboume fiftyfive miles to boughton under blean fiftyeight miles to harbledown and sixty miles to canterbury it gave him a sense of timeless buoyancy to know that few in his universe would recall chaucer or know any london except the village on gansireed st thomas was preserved in the orange catholic bible and the azhar book but canterbury was gone from the memories of men as was the planet which had known it there lay the burden of his memories of all those lives which threatened to engulf him he had made that trip to canterbury once his present trip was longer though and more dangerous presently he crept over the dunes crest and made his way toward the moonlit rocks he blended with shadows slid across the crests made no sounds that might signal his presence the dust had gone as it often did just before a storm and the night was brilliant the day had revealed no movement but he heard small creatures hustling in the darkness as he neared the rocks in a valley between two dunes he came upon a family of jerboa which scampered away at his approach he eased over the next crest his emotions beset by salty anxieties that cleft he had seen did it lead up to an entrance and there were other concerns the oldtime sietch had always been guarded by traps poisoned barbs in pits poisoned spines on plants he felt himself caught up in the fremen agrapha the earminded night and he listened for the slightest sound the grey rocks lowered above him now made giant by his nearness as he listened he heard birds invisible in that cliff the soft calling of winged prey they were the sounds of daybirds but abroad by night what had turned their world around human predation abruptly leto froze against the sand there was fire on the cliff a ballet of glittering and mysterious gems against the nights black gauze the sort of signal a sietch might send to wanderers across the bled who were these occupants of this place he crept forward into the deepest shadows at the cliffs base felt along the rock with a hand sliding his body behind the hand as he sought the fissure hed seen by daylight he located it on his eighth step slipped the sandsnorkel from his kit and probed the darkness as he moved something tight and binding dropped over his shoulders and arms immobilizing him trapvine he resisted the urge to struggle that only made the vine pull tighter he dropped the snorkel flexed the fingers of his right hand trying for the knife at his waist he felt like a bare innocent for not throwing something into that fissure from a distance testing the darkness for its dangers his mind had been too occupied by the fire on the cliff each movement tightened the trapvine but his fingers at last touched the knife hilt stealthily he closed his hand around the hilt began to slip it free flaring light enveloped him arresting all movement ahhh a fine catch in our net it was a heavy masculine voice from behind leto something vaguely familiar in the tone leto tried to turn his head aware of the vines dangerous propensity to crush a body which moved too freely a hand took his knife before he could see his captor the hand moved expertly over his body extracting the small devices he and ghanima carried as a matter of survival nothing escaped the searcher not even the shigawire garrote concealed in his hair leto still had not seen the man fingers did something with the trapvine and he found he could breathe easier but the man said do not struggle leto atreides i have your water in my cup by supreme effort leto remained calm said you know my name of course when one baits a trap its for a purpose one aims for a specific quarry not so leto remained silent but his thoughts whirled you feel betrayed the heavy voice said hands turned him around gently but with an obvious show of strength an adult male was telling the child what the odds were leto stared up into the glare from twin floater flares saw the black outline of a stillsuitmasked face the hood as his eyes adjusted he made out a dark strip of skin the utterly shadowed eyes of melange addiction you wonder why we went to all this trouble the man said his voice issued from the shielded lower part of his face with a curious muffled quality as though he tried to conceal an accent i long ago ceased to wonder at the numbers of people who want the atreides twins dead leto said their reasons are obvious as he spoke letos mind flung itself against the unknown as against a cage questing wildly for answers a baited trap but who had known except ghanima impossible ghanima wouldnt betray her own brother then did someone know him well enough to predict his actions who his grandmother how could she you could not be permitted to go on as you were the man said very bad before ascending the throne you need to be educated the whiteless eyes stared down at him you wonder how one could presume to educate such a person as yourself you with the knowledge of a multitude held there in your memories thats just it you see you think yourself educated but all you are is a repository of dead lives you dont yet have a life of your own youre just a walking surfeit of others all with one goal to seek death not good in a ruler being a death seeker youd strew your surroundings with corpses your father for example never understood the you dare speak of him that way manys the time ive dared it he was only paul atreides after all well boy welcome to your school the man brought a hand from beneath his robe touched letos cheek leto felt the jolt of a slapshot and found himself winding downward into a darkness where a green flag waved it was the green banner of the atreides with its day and night symbols its dune staff which concealed a water tube he heard the water gurgling as unconsciousness enfolded him or was it someone chuckling we can still remember the golden days before heisenberg who showed humans the walls enclosing our predestined arguments the lives within me find this amusing knowledge you see has no uses without purpose but purpose is what builds enclosing walls leto atreides ii his voice alia found herself speaking harshly to the guards she confronted in the temple foyer there were nine of them in the dusty green uniforms of the suburban patrol and they were still panting and sweating with their exertions the light of late afternoon came in the door behind them the area had been cleared of pilgrims so my orders mean nothing to you she demanded and she wondered at her own anger not trying to contain it but letting it run her body trembled with unleashed tensions idaho gone the lady jessica no reports only rumors that they were on salusa why hadnt idaho sent a message what had he done had he learned finally about javid alia wore the yellow of arrakeen mourning the color of the burning sun from fremen history in a few minutes she would be leading the second and final funeral procession to old gap there to complete the stone marker for her lost nephew the work would be completed in the night fitting homage to one whod been destined to lead fremen the priestly guards appeared defiant in the face of her anger not shamed at all they stood in front of her outlined by the waning light the odor of their perspiration was easily detected through the light and inefficient stillsuits of city dwellers their leader a tall blond kaza with the bourka symbols of the cadelam family flung his stillsuit mask aside to speak more clearly his voice was full of the prideful intonations to be expected from a scion of the family which once had ruled at sietch abbir certainly we tried to capture him the man was obviously outraged at her attack he speaks blasphemy we know your orders but we heard him with our own ears and you failed to catch him alia said her voice low and accusing one of the other guards a short young woman tried to defend them the crowds were thick there i swear people interfered with us well keep after him the cadelam said well not always fail alia scowled why wont you understand and obey me my lady we what will you do scion of the cade lamb if you capture him and find him to be in truth my brother he obviously did not hear her special emphasis on his name although he could not be a priestly guard without some education and the wit to go with it did he want to sacrifice himself the guardsman swallowed then we must kill him ourselves for he breeds disorder the others stood aghast at this but still defiant they knew what they had heard he calls upon the tribes to band against you the cadelam said alia knew how to handle him now she spoke in a quiet matteroffact tone i see then if you must sacrifice yourself this way taking him openly for all to see who you are and what you do then i guess you must sacrifice my he broke off glanced at his companions as kaza of this group their appointed leader he had the right to speak for them but he showed signs that he wished hed remained silent the other guards stirred uncomfortably in the heat of the chase theyd defied alia one could only reflect now upon such defiance of the womb of heaven with obvious discomfort the guards opened a small space between themselves and their kaza for the good of the church our official reaction would have to be severe alia said you understand that dont you but he ive heard him myself she said but this is a special case he can not be muaddib my lady how little you know she thought she said we can not risk taking him in the open harming him where others could see it if another opportunity presents itself of course hes always surrounded by crowds these days then i fear you must be patient of course if you insist on defying me she left the consequences hanging in the air unspoken but well understood the cadelam was ambitious a shining career before him we didnt mean defiance my lady the man had himself under control now we acted hastily i can see that forgive us but he nothing has happened nothing to forgive she said using the common fremen formula it was one of the many ways a tribe kept peace in its ranks and this cadelam was still old fremen enough to remember that his family carried a long tradition of leadership guilt was the naibs whip to be used sparingly fremen served best when free of guilt or resentment he showed his realization of her judgment by bowing his head saying for the good of the tribe i understand go refresh yourselves she said the procession begins in a few minutes yes my lady they bustled away every movement revealing their relief at this escape within alias head a bass rumbled ahhhhh you handled that most adroitly one or two of them still believe you desire the preacher dead theyll find a way shut up she hissed shut up i should never have listened to you look what youve done set you on the road to immortality the bass voice said she felt it echoing in her skull like a distant ache thought where can i hide theres no place to go ghanimas knife is sharp the baron said remember that alia blinked yes that was something to remember ghanimas knife was sharp that knife might yet cut them out of their present predicament if you believe certain words you believe their hidden arguments when you believe something is right or wrong true or false you believe the assumptions in the words which express the arguments such assumptions are often full of holes but remain most precious to the convinced the openended proof from the panoplia prophetica letos mind floated in a stew of fierce odors he recognized the heavy cinnamon of melange the confined sweat of working bodies the acridity of an uncapped deathstill dust of many sorts with flint dominant the odors formed a trail through dreamsand created shapes of fog in a dead land he knew these odors should tell him something but part of him could not yet listen thoughts like wraiths floated through his mind in this time i have no finished features i am all of my ancestors the sun setting into the sand is the sun setting into my soul once this multitude within me was great but thats ended im fremen and ill have a fremen ending the golden path is ended before it began its nothing but a windblown trail we fremen knew all the tricks to conceal ourselves we left no feces no water no tracks now look at my trail vanish a masculine voice spoke close to his ear i could kill you atreides i could kill you atreides it was repeated over and over until it lost meaning became a wordless thing carried within letos dreaming a litany of sorts i could kill you atreides leto cleared his throat and felt the reality of this simple act shake his senses his dry throat managed who the voice beside him said im an educated fremen and ive killed my man you took away our gods atreides what do we care about your stinking muaddib your gods dead was that a real ouraba voice or another part of his dream leto opened his eyes found himself unfettered on a hard couch he looked upward at rock dim glowglobes an unmasked face staring down at him so close he could smell the breath with its familiar odors of a sietch diet the face was fremen no mistaking the dark skin those sharp features and waterwasted flesh this was no fat city dweller here was a desert fremen i am namri father of javid the fremen said do you know me now atreides i know javid leto husked yes your family knows my son well i am proud of him you atreides may know him even better soon what i am one of your schoolmasters atreides i have only one function i am the one who could kill you id do it gladly in this school to graduate is to live to fail is to be given into my hands leto heard implacable sincerity in that voice it chilled him this was a human gom jabbar a highhanded enemy to test his right of entrance into the human concourse leto sensed his grandmothers hand in this and behind her the faceless masses of the bene gesserit he writhed at this thought your education begins with me namri said that is just it is fitting because it could end with me listen to me carefully now my every word carries your life in it everything about me holds your death within it leto shot his glance around the room rock walls barren only this couch the dim glowglobes and a dark passage behind namri you will not get past me namri said and leto believed him whyre you doing this leto asked thats already been explained think what plans are in your head you are here and you can not put a future into your present condition the two dont go together now and future but if you really know your past if you look backward and see where youve been perhaps therell be reason once more if not there will be your death leto noted that namris tone was not unkind but it was firm and no denying the death in it namri rocked back on his heels stared at the rock ceiling in olden times fremen faced east at dawn eos you know thats dawn in one of the old tongues bitter pride in his voice leto said i speak that tongue you have not listened to me then namri said and there was a knife edge in his voice night was the time of chaos day was the time of order thats how it was in the time of that tongue you say you speak darknessdisorder lightorder we fremen changed that eos was the light we distrusted we preferred the light of a moon or the stars light was too much order and that can be fatal you see what you eosatreides have done man is a creature of only that light which protects him the sun was our enemy on dune namri brought his gaze down to letos level what light do you prefer atreides by namris poised attitude leto sensed that this question carried deep weight would the man kill him if he failed to answer correctly he might leto saw namris hand resting quietly next to the polished hilt of a crysknife a ring in the form of a magic tortoise glittered on the fremens knife hand leto eased himself up onto his elbows sent his mind questing into fremen beliefs they trusted the law and loved to hear its lessons expounded in analogy these old fremen the light of the moon i prefer the light of lisanu lhaqq leto said watching namri for subtle revelations the man seemed disappointed but his hand moved away from his knife it is the light of truth the light of the perfect man in which the influence of almutakallim can clearly be seen leto continued what other light would a human prefer you speak as one who recites not one who believes namri said and leto thought i did recite but he began to sense the drift of namris thoughts how his words were filtered through early training in the ancient riddle game thousands of these riddles went into fremen training and leto had but to bend his attention upon this custom to find examples flooding his mind challenge silence answer the friend of the hunted namri nodded to himself as though he shared this thought said there is a cave which is the cave of life for fremen it is an actual cave which the desert has hidden shaihulud the greatgrandfather of all fremen sealed up that cave my uncle ziamad told me about it and he never lied to me there is such a cave leto heard the challenging silence when namri finished speaking cave of life my uncle stilgar also told me of that cave leto said it was sealed to keep cowards from hiding there the reflection of a glowglobe glittered in namris shadowed eyes he asked would you atreides open that cave you seek to control life through a ministry your central ministry for information auqaf and hajj the maulana in charge is called kausar he has come a long way from his familys beginnings at the salt mines of niazi tell me atreides what is wrong with your ministry leto sat up aware now that he was fully into the riddle game with namri and that the forfeit was death the man gave every indication that hed use that crysknife at the first wrong answer namri recognizing this awareness in leto said believe me atreides i am the clodcrusher i am the iron hammer now leto understood namri saw himself as mirzabah the iron hammer with which the dead are beaten who can not reply satisfactorily to the questions they must answer before entry into paradise what was wrong with the central ministry which alia and her priests had created leto thought of why hed come into the desert and a small hope returned to him that the golden path might yet appear in his universe what this namri implied by his question was no more than the motive which had driven muaddibs own son into the desert gods it is to show the way leto said namris chin jerked down and he stared sharply at leto can it be true that you believe this he demanded its why i am here leto said to find the way to find it for myself leto put his feet over the edge of the cot the rock floor was uncarpeted cold the priests created their ministry to hide the way you speak like a true rebel namri said and he rubbed the tortoise ring on his finger we shall see listen carefully once more you know the high shield wall at jalaluddin that wall bears my familys marks carved there in the first days javid my son has seen those marks abedi jalal my nephew has seen them mujahid shafqat of the other ones he too has seen our marks in the season of the storms near sukkar i came down with my friend yakup abad near that place the winds were blistering hot like the whirlwinds from which we learned our dances we did not take time to see the marks because a storm blocked the way but when the storm passed we saw the vision of thatta upon the blown sand the face of shakir ali was there for a moment looking down upon his city of tombs the vision was gone in the instant but we all saw it tell me atreides where can i find that city of tombs the whirlwinds from which we learned our dances leto thought the vision of thatta and shakir ali these were the words of a zensunni wanderer those who considered themselves to be the only true men of the desert and fremen were forbidden to have tombs the city of tombs is at the end of the path which all men follow leto said and he dredged up the zensunni beatifies it is in a garden one thousand paces square there is a fine entry corridor two hundred and thirtythree paces long and one hundred paces wide all paved with marble from ancient jaipur therein dwells arrazzaq he who provides food for all who ask and on the day of reckoning all who stand up and seek the city of tombs shall not find it for it is written that which you know in one world you shall not find in another again you recite without belief namri sneered but ill accept it for now because i think you know why youre here a cold smile touched his lips i give you a provisional future atreides leto studied the man warily was this another question in disguise good namri said your awareness has been prepared ive sunk home the barbs one more thing then have you heard that they use imitation stillsuits in the cities of far kadrish as namri waited leto quested in his mind for a hidden meaning imitation stillsuits they were worn on many planets he said the foppish habits of kadrish are an old story often repeated the wise animal blends into its surroundings namri nodded slowly then the one who trapped you and brought you here will see you presently do not try to leave this place it would be your death arising as he spoke namri went out into the dark passage for a long time after he had gone leto stared into the passage he could hear sounds out there the quiet voices of men on guard duty namris story of the miragevision stayed with leto it brought up the long desert crossing to this place it no longer mattered whether this were jacurutufondak namri was not a smuggler he was something much more potent and the game namri played smelled of the lady jessica it stank of the bene gesserit leto sensed an enclosing peril in this realization but that dark passage where namri had gone was the only exit from this room and outside lay a strange sietch beyond that the desert the harsh severity of that desert its ordered chaos with mirages and endless dunes came over leto as part of the trap in which he was caught he could recross that sand but where would flight take him the thought was like stagnant water it would not quench his thirst because of the onepointed time awareness in which the conventional mind remains immersed humans tend to think of everything in a sequential wordoriented framework this mental trap produces very shortterm concepts of effectiveness and consequences a condition of constant unplanned response to crises lietkynes the arrakis workbook words and movements simultaneous jessica reminded herself and she bent her thoughts to those necessary mental preparations for the coming encounter the hour was shortly after breakfast the golden sun of salusa secundus just beginning to touch the far wall of the enclosed garden which she could see from her window she had dressed herself carefully the black hooded cloak of a reverend mother but it carried the atreides crest in gold worked into an embroidered ring around the hem and again at the cuff of each sleeve jessica arranged the drape of her garment carefully as she turned her back on the window holding her left arm across her waist to present the hawk motif of the crest faradn noted the atreides symbols commenting on them as he entered but he betrayed no anger or surprise she detected subtle humor in his voice and wondered at it she saw that he had clad himself in the grey leotard which she had suggested he sat on the low green divan to which she directed him relaxing with his right arm along the back why do i trust her he wondered this is a bene gesserit witch jessica reading the thought in the contrast between his relaxed body and the expression on his face smiled and said you trust me because you know our bargain is a good one and you want what i can teach you she saw the pinch of a scowl touch his brow waved her left hand to calm him no i dont read minds i read the face the body the mannerisms tone of voice set of arms anyone can do this once they learn the bene gesserit way and you will teach me im sure youve studied the reports about us she said is there anywhere a report that we fail to deliver on a direct promise no reports but we survive in part by the complete confidence which people can have in our truthfulness that has not changed i find this reasonable he said im anxious to begin im surprised youve never asked the bene gesserit for a teacher she said they wouldve leaped at the opportunity to put you in their debt my mother would never listen to me when i urged her to do this he said but now he shrugged an eloquent comment on wensicias banishment shall we start it wouldve been better to begin this when you were much younger jessica said itll be harder for you now and itll take much longer youll have to begin by learning patience extreme patience i pray youll not find it too high a price not for the reward you offer she heard the sincerity the pressure of expectations and the touch of awe in his voice these formed a place to begin she said the art of patience then starting with some elementary pranabindu exercises for the legs and arms for your breathing well leave the hands and fingers for later are you ready she seated herself on a stool facing him faradn nodded holding an expectant expression on his face to conceal the sudden onset of fear tyekanik had warned him that there must be a trick in the lady jessicas offer something brewed by the sisterhood you can not believe that she has abandoned them again or that they have abandoned her faradn had stopped the argument with an angry outburst for which hed been immediately sorry his emotional reaction had made him agree more quickly with tyekaniks precautions faradn glanced at the corners of the room the subtle gleam of jems in the coving all that glittered was not jems everything in this room would be recorded and good minds would review every nuance every word every movement jessica smiled noting the direction of his gaze but not revealing that she knew where his attention had wandered she said to learn patience in the bene gesserit way you must begin by recognizing the essential raw instability of our universe we call nature meaning this totality in all of its manifestations the ultimate nonabsolute to free your vision and permit you to recognize this conditional natures changing ways you will hold your two hands at arms length in front of you stare at your extended hands first the palms and then the backs examine the fingers front and back do it faradn complied but he felt foolish these were his own hands he knew them imagine your hands aging jessica said they must grow very old in your eyes very very old notice how dry the skin my hands dont change he said he already could feel the muscles of his upper arms trembling continue to stare at your hands make them old as old as you can imagine it may take time but when you see them age reverse the process make your hands young again as young as you can make them strive to take them from infancy to great age at will back and forth back and forth they dont change he protested his shoulders ached if you demand it of your senses your hands will change she said concentrate upon visualizing the flow of time which you desire infancy to age age to infancy it may take you hours days months but it can be achieved reversing that changeflow will teach you to see every system as something spinning in relative stability only relative i thought i was learning patience she heard anger in his voice an edge of frustration and relative stability she said this is the perspective which you create with your own belief and beliefs can be manipulated by imagination youve learned only a limited way of looking at the universe now you must make the universe your own creation this will permit you to harness any relative stability to your own uses to whatever uses you are capable of imagining how long did you say it takes patience she reminded him a spontaneous grin touched his lips his eyes wavered toward her look at your hands she snapped the grin vanished his gaze jerked back to a fixated concentration upon his extended hands what do i do when my arms get tired he asked stop talking and concentrate she said if you become too tired stop return to it after a few minutes of relaxation and exercise you must persist in this until you succeed at your present stage this is more important than you could possibly realize learn this lesson or the others will not come faradn inhaled a deep breath chewed his lips stared at his hands he turned them slowly front back front back his shoulders trembled with fatigue front back nothing changed jessica arose crossed to the only door he spoke without removing his attention from his hands where are you going youll work better on this if youre alone ill return in about an hour patience i know she studied him a moment how intent he looked he reminded her with a hearttugging abruptness of her own lost son she permitted herself a sigh said when i return ill give you the exercise lessons to relieve your muscles give it time youll be astonished at what you can make your body and your senses do she let herself out the omnipresent guards took up station three paces behind her as she strode down the hall their awe and fear were obvious they were sardaukar thricewarned of her prowess raised on the stories of their defeat by the fremen of arrakis this witch was a fremen reverend mother a bene gesserit and an atreides jessica glancing back saw their stern faces as a milepost in her design she turned away as she came to the stairs went down them and through a short passage into the garden below her windows now if only duncan and gurney can do their parts she thought as she felt the gravel of a pathway beneath her feet saw the golden light filtered by greenery you will learn the integrated communication methods as you complete the next step in your mentat education this is a gestalten function which will overlay data paths in your awareness resolving complexities and masses of input from the mentat indexcatalogue techniques which you already have mastered your initial problem will be the breaking tensions arising from the divergent assembly of minutiaedata on specialized subjects be warned without mentat overlay integration you can be immersed in the babel problem which is the label we give to the omnipresent dangers of achieving wrong combinations from accurate information the mentat handbook the sound of fabrics rubbing together sent sparks of awareness through leto he was surprised that he had turned his sensitivity to the point where he automatically identified the fabrics from their sound the combination came from a fremen robe rubbing against the coarse hangings of a door curtain he turned toward the sound it came from the passage where namri had gone minutes before as leto turned he saw his captor enter it was the same man who had taken him prisoner the same dark strip of skin above the stillsuit mask the identical searing eyes the man lifted a hand to his mask slipped the catchtube from his nostrils lowered the mask and in the same motion flipped his hood back even before he focused on the scar of the inkvine whip along the mans jaw leto recognized him the recognition was a totality in his awareness with the search for confirming details coming afterward no mistake about it this rolling lump of humanity this warriortroubadour was gurney halleck leto clenched his hands into fists overcome momentarily by the shock of recognition no atreides retainer had ever been more loyal none better at shield fighting hed been pauls trusted confidant and teacher he was the lady jessicas servant these recognitions and more surged through letos mind gurney was his captor gurney and namri were in this conspiracy together and jessicas hand was in it with them i understand youve met our namri halleck said pray believe him young sir he has one function and one function only hes the one capable of killing you should the need arise leto responded automatically with his fathers tones so youve joined my enemies gurney i never thought the try none of your devil tricks on me lad halleck said im proof against them all i follow your grandmothers orders your education has been planned to the last detail it was she who approved my selection of namri what comes next painful as it may seem is at her command and what does she command halleck lifted a hand from the folds of his robe exposed a fremen injector primitive but efficient its transparent tube was charged with blue fluid leto squirmed backward on the cot was stopped by the rock wall as he moved namri entered stood beside halleck with hand on crysknife together they blocked the only exit i see youve recognized the spice essence halleck said youre to take the worm trip lad you must go through it otherwise what your father dared and you dare not would hang over you for the rest of your days leto shook his head wordlessly this was the thing he and ghanima knew could overwhelm them gurney was an ignorant fool how could jessica leto felt the fatherpresence in his memories it surged into his mind trying to strip away his defenses leto wanted to shriek outrage could not move his lips but this was the wordless thing which his preborn awareness most feared this was prescient trance the reading of immutable future with all of its fixity and its terrors surely jessica could not have ordered such an ordeal for her own grandson but her presence loomed in his mind filling him with acceptance arguments even the litany of fear was pressed upon him with a repetitive droning i must not fear fear is the mindkiller fear is the little death that brings total obliteration i will face my fear i will permit it to pass over me and through me and when it has gone past with an oath already ancient when chaldea was young leto tried to move tried to leap at the two men standing over him but his muscles refused to obey as though he already existed in the trance leto saw hallecks hand move the injector approach the light of a glowglobe sparkled within the blue fluid the injector touched letos left arm pain lanced through him shot upward to the muscles of his head abruptly leto saw a young woman sitting outside a crude hut in dawnlight she sat right there in front of him roasting coffee beans to a rose brown adding cardamom and melange the voice of a rebeck echoed from somewhere behind him the music echoed and echoed until it entered his head still echoing it suffused his body and he felt himself to be large very large not a child at all and his skin was not his own he knew that sensation his skin was not his own warmth spread through his body as abruptly as his first vision he found himself standing in darkness it was night stars like a rain of embers fell in gusts from a brilliant cosmos part of him knew there was no escaping but still he tried to fight it until the fatherpresence intruded i will protect you in the trance the others within will not take you wind tumbled leto rolled him hissing pouring dust and sand over him cutting his arms his face abrading his clothes whipping the loosetorn ends of now useless fabric but he felt no pain and he saw the cuts heal as rapidly as they appeared still he rolled with the wind and his skin was not his own it will happen he thought but the thought was distant and came as though it were not his own not really his own no more than his skin the vision absorbed him it evolved into a stereologic memory which separated past and present future and present future and past each separation mingled into a trinocular focus which he sensed as the multidimensional relief map of his own future existence he thought time is a measure of space just as a range finder is a measure of space but measuring locks us into the place we measure he sensed the trance deepening it came as an amplification of internal consciousness which his selfidentity soaked up and through which he felt himself changing it was living time and he could not arrest an instant of it memory fragments future and past deluged him but they existed as montageinmotion their relationships underwent a constant dance his memory was a lens an illuminating searchlight which picked out fragments isolating them but forever failing to stop the ceaseless motion and modification which surged into his view that which he and ghanima had planned came through the searchlight dominating everything but now it terrified him vision reality ached in him the uncritical inevitability made his ego cringe and his skin was not his own past and present tumbled through him surging across the barriers of his terror he could not separate them one moment he felt himself setting forth on the butlerian jihad eager to destroy any machine which simulated human awareness that had to be the past over and done with yet his senses hurtled through the experience absorbing the most minute details he heard a ministercompanion speaking from a pulpit we must negate the machinesthatthink humans must set their own guidelines this is not something machines can do reasoning depends upon programming not on hardware and we are the ultimate program he heard the voice clearly knew his surroundings a vast wooden hall with dark windows light came from sputtering flames and his ministercompanion said our jihad is a dump program we dump the things which destroy us as humans and it was in letos mind that the speaker had been a servant of computers one who knew them and serviced them but the scene vanished and ghanima stood in front of him saying gurney knows he told me theyre duncans words and duncan was speaking as a mentat in doing good avoid notoriety in doing evil avoid selfawareness that had to be future far future but he felt the reality it was as intense as any past from his multitude of lives and he whispered isnt that true father but the fatherpresence within spoke warningly dont invite disaster youre learning stroboscopic awareness now without it you could overrun yourself lose your placemark in time and the basrelief imagery persisted intrusions hammered at him pastpresentnow there was no true separation he knew he had to flow with this thing but the flowing terrified him how could he return to any recognizable place yet he felt himself being forced to cease every effort of resistance he could not grasp his new universe in motionless labeled bits no bit would stand still things could not be forever ordered and formulated he had to find the rhythm of change and see between the changes to the changing itself without knowing where it began he found himself moving within a gigantic moment bienheureux able to see the past in the future present in past the now in both past and future it was the accumulation of centuries experienced between one heartbeat and the next letos awareness floated free no objective psyche to compensate for consciousness no barriers namris provisional future remained lightly in his memory but it shared awareness with many futures and in this shattering awareness all of his past every inner life became his own with the help of the greatest within him he dominated they were his he thought when you study an object from a distance only its principle may be seen he had achieved the distance and he could see his own life now the multipast and its memories were his burden his joy and his necessity but the worm trip had added another dimension and his father no longer stood guard within him because the need no longer existed leto saw through the distances clearly past and present and the past presented him with an ultimate ancestor one who was called harum and without whom the distant future would not be these clear distances provided new principles new dimensions of sharing whichever life he now chose hed live it out in an autonomous sphere of mass experience a trail of lives so convoluted that no single lifetime could count the generations of it aroused this mass experience held the power to subdue his selfdom it could make itself felt upon an individual a nation a society or an entire civilization that of course was why gurney had been taught to fear him why namris knife waited they could not be allowed to see this power within him no one could ever see it in its fullness not even ghanima presently leto sat up saw that only namri remained watching in an old voice leto said theres no single set of limits for all men universal prescience is an empty myth only the most powerful local currents of time may be foretold but in an infinite universe local can be so gigantic that your mind shrinks from it namri shook his head not understanding wheres gurney leto asked he left lest he have to watch me slay you will you slay me namri it was almost a plea to have the man do it namri took his hand from his knife since you ask me to do it i will not if you were indifferent though the malady of indifference is what destroys many things leto said he nodded to himself yes even civilizations die of it its as though that were the price demanded for achieving new levels of complexity or consciousness he looked up at namri so they told you to look for indifference in me and he saw namri was more than a killer namri was devious as a sign of unbridled power namri said but it was a lie indifferent power yes leto sat up sighed deeply there was no moral grandeur to my fathers life namri only a local trap which he built for himself o paul thou muaddib mahdi of all men thy breath exhaled sent forth the hurricane songs of muaddib never ghanima said id kill him on our wedding night she spoke with a barbed stubbornness which thus far had resisted all blandishments alia and her advisors had been at it half the night keeping the royal quarters in a state of unrest sending out for new advisors for food and drink the entire temple and its adjoining keep seethed with the frustrations of unmade decisions ghanima sat composedly on a green floater chair in her own quarters a large room with rough tan walls to simulate sietch rock the ceiling however was imbar crystal which flickered with blue light and the floor was black tile the furnishings were sparse a small writing table five floater chairs and a narrow cot set into an alcove fremen fashion ghanima wore a robe of yellow mourning you are not a free person who can settle every aspect of her own life alia said for perhaps the hundredth time the little fool must come to realize this sooner or later she must approve the betrothal to faradn she must let her kill him later but the betrothal requires open acknowledgment by the fremen affianced he killed my brother ghanima said holding to the single note which sustained her everyone knows this fremen would spit at the mention of my name were i to consent to this betrothal and that is one of the reasons why you must consent alia thought she said his mother did it he has banished her for it what more do you want of him his blood ghanima said hes a corrino he has denounced his own mother alia protested and why should you worry about the fremen rabble theyll accept whatever we tell them to accept ghani the peace of the empire demands that i will not consent ghanima said you can not announce the betrothal without me irulan entering the room as ghanima spoke glanced inquiringly at alia and the two female advisors who stood dejectedly beside her irulan saw alia throw up her arms in disgust and drop into a chair facing ghanima you speak to her irulan alia said irulan pulled a floater into place sat down beside alia youre a corrino irulan ghanima said dont press your luck with me ghanima got up crossed to her cot and sat on it crosslegged glaring back at the women irulan she saw had dressed in a black aba to match alias the hood thrown back to reveal her golden hair it was mourning hair under the yellow glow of the floating globes which illuminated the room irulan glanced at alia stood up and crossed to stand facing ghanima ghani id kill him myself if that were the way to solve matters and faradns my own blood as you so kindly emphasized but you have duties far higher than your commitment to fremen that doesnt sound any better coming from you than it does from my precious aunt ghanima said the blood of a brother can not be washed off thats more than some little fremen aphorism irulan pressed her lips together then faradn holds your grandmother captive he holds duncan and if we dont im not satisfied with your stories of how all this happened ghanima said peering past irulan at alia once duncan died rather than let enemies take my father perhaps this new gholaflesh is no longer the same as duncan was charged with protecting your grandmothers life alia said whirling in her chair im confident he chose the only way to do that and she thought duncan duncan you werent supposed to do it this way ghanima reading the overtones of contrivance in alias voice stared across at her aunt youre lying o womb of heaven ive heard about your fight with my grandmother what is it you fear to tell us about her and your precious duncan youve heard it all alia said but she felt a stab of fear at this bald accusation and what it implied fatigue had made her careless she realized she arose said everything i know you know turning to irulan you work on her she must be made to ghanima interrupted with a coarse fremen expletive which came shockingly from the immature lips into the quick silence she said you think me just a mere child that you have years in which to work on me that eventually ill accept think again o heavenly regent you know better than anyone the years i have within me ill listen to them not to you alia barely suppressed an angry retort stared hard at ghanima abomination who was this child a new fear of ghanima began to rise in alia had she accepted her own compromise with the lives which came to her preborn alia said theres time yet for you to see reason there may be time yet for me to see faradns blood spurt around my knife ghanima said depend on it if im ever left alone with him one of us will surely die you think you loved your brother more than i irulan demanded you play a fools game i was mother to him as i was to you i was you never knew him ghanima said all of you except at times my beloved aunt persist in thinking us children youre the fools alia knows look at her run away from i run from nothing alia said but she turned her back on irulan and ghanima and stared at the two amazons who were pretending not to hear this argument theyd obviously given up on ghanima perhaps they sympathized with her angrily alia sent them from the room relief was obvious on their faces as they obeyed you run ghanima persisted ive chosen a way of life which suits me alia said turning back to stare at ghanima sitting crosslegged on the cot was it possible shed made that terrible inner compromise alia tried to see the signs of it in ghanima but was unable to read a single betrayal alia wondered then has she seen it in me but how could she you feared to be the window for a multitude ghanima accused but were the preborn and we know youll be their window conscious or unconscious you can not deny them and she thought yes i know you abomination and perhaps ill go as you have gone but for now i can only pity you and despise you silence hung between ghanima and alia an almost palpable thing which alerted the bene gesserit training in irulan she glanced from one to the other then whyre you so quiet suddenly ive just had a thought which requires considerable reflection alia said reflect at your leisure dear aunt ghanima sneered alia putting down fatigueinflamed anger said enough for now leave her to think perhaps shell come to her senses irulan arose said its almost dawn anyway ghani before we go would you care to hear the latest message from faradn he i would not ghanima said and hereafter cease calling me by that ridiculous diminutive ghani it merely supports the mistaken assumption that im a child you can whyd you and alia grow so suddenly quiet irulan asked reverting to her previous question but casting it now in a delicate mode of voice ghanima threw her head back in laughter irulan youd try voice on me what irulan was taken aback youd teach your grandmother to suck eggs ghanima said id what the fact that i remember the expression and youve never even heard it before should give you pause ghanima said it was an old expression of scorn when you bene gesserit were young but if that doesnt chasten you ask yourself what your royal parents couldve been thinking of when they named you irulan or is it ruinal in spite of her training irulan flushed youre trying to goad me ghanima and you tried to use voice on me on me i remember the first human efforts in that direction i remember then ruinous irulan now get out of here all of you but alia was intrigued now caught by an inner suggestion which sluffed her fatigue aside she said perhaps ive a suggestion which could change your mind ghani still ghani a brittle laugh escaped ghanima then reflect but a moment if i desire to kill faradn i need but fall in with your plans i presume youve thought of that beware of ghani in a tractable mood you see im being utterly candid with you thats what i hoped alia said if you the blood of a brother can not be washed away ghanima said ill not go before my fremen loved ones a traitor to that never to forgive never to forget isnt that our catechism i warn you here and ill say it publicly you can not betroth me to faradn who knowing me would believe it faradn himself could not believe it fremen hearing of such a betrothal would laugh into their sleeves and say see she lures him into a trap if you i understand that alia said moving to irulans side irulan she noted was standing in shocked silence aware already of where this conversation was headed and so i would be luring him into a trap ghanima said if thats what you want ill agree but he may not fall if you wish this false betrothal as the empty coin with which to buy back my grandmother and your precious duncan so be it but its on your head buy them back faradn though is mine him ill kill irulan whirled to face alia before she could speak alia if we go back on our word she let it hang there a moment while alia smilingly reflected on the potential wrath among the great houses in faufreluches assembled the destructive consequences to believe in atreides honor the loss of religious trust all of the great and small building blocs which would tumble itd rule against us irulan protested all belief in pauls prophethood would be destroyed it the empire who could dare question our right to decide what is wrong and what is right alia asked voice mild we mediate between good and evil i need but proclaim you cant do this irulan protested pauls memory is just another tool of church and state ghanima said dont speak foolishness irulan ghanima touched the crysknife at her waist looked up at alia ive misjudged my clever aunt regent of all thats holy in muaddibs empire i have indeed misjudged you lure faradn into our parlor if you will this is recklessness irulan pleaded you agree to this betrothal ghanima alia asked ignoring irulan on my terms ghanima said hand still on her crysknife i wash my hands of this irulan said actually wringing her hands i was willing to argue for a true betrothal to heal well give you a wound much more difficult to heal alia and i ghanima said bring him quickly if hell come and perhaps he will would he suspect a child of my tender years let us plan the formal ceremony of betrothal to require his presence let there be an opportunity for me to be alone with him just a minute or two irulan shuddered at this evidence that ghanima was after all fremen entire child no different from adult in this terrible bloodiness after all fremen children were accustomed to slay the wounded on the battlefield releasing women from this chore that they might collect the bodies and haul them away to the deathstills and ghanima speaking with the voice of a fremen child piled horror upon horror by the studied maturity of her words by the ancient sense of vendetta which hung like an aura around her done alia said and she fought to keep voice and face from betraying her glee well prepare the formal charter of betrothal well have the signatures witnessed by the proper assemblage from the great houses faradn can not possibly doubt hell doubt but hell come ghanima said and hell have guards but will they think to guard him from me for the love of all that paul tried to do irulan protested let us at least make faradns death appear an accident or the result of malice by outside ill take joy in displaying my bloody knife to my brethren ghanima said alia i beg you irulan said abandon this rash insanity declare kanly against faradn anything to we dont require formal declaration of vendetta against him ghanima said the whole empire knows how we must feel she pointed to the sleeve of her robe we wear the yellow of mourning when i exchange it for the black of a fremen betrothed will that fool anyone pray that it fools faradn alia said and the delegates of the great houses we invite to witness the every one of those delegates will turn against you irulan said you know that excellent point ghanima said choose those delegates with care alia they must be ones we wont mind eliminating later irulan threw up her arms in despair turned and fled have her put under close surveillance lest she try to warn her nephew ghanima said dont try to teach me how to conduct a plot alia said she turned and followed irulan but at a slower pace the guards outside and the waiting aides were sucked up in her wake like sand particles drawn into the vortex of a rising worm ghanima shook her head sadly from side to side as the door closed thought its as poor leto and i thought gods below i wish itd been me the tiger killed instead of him many forces sought control of the atreides twins and when the death of leto was announced this movement of plot and counterplot was amplified note the relative motivations the sisterhood feared alia an adult abomination but still wanted those genetic characteristics carried by the atreides the church hierarchy of auqaf and hajj saw only the power implicit in control of muaddibs heir choam wanted a doorway to the wealth of dune faradn and his sardaukar sought a return to glory for house corrino the spacing guild feared the equation arrakis melange without the spice they could not navigate jessica wished to repair what her disobedience to the bene gesserit had created few thought to ask the twins what their plans might be until it was too late the book of kreos shortly after the evening meal leto saw a man walking past the arched doorway to his chamber and his mind went with the man the passage had been left open and leto had seen some activity out there spice hampers being wheeled past three women with the obvious offworld sophistication of dress which marked them as smugglers this man who took letos mind walking might have been no different except that he moved like stilgar a much younger stilgar it was a peculiar walk his mind took time filled letos awareness like a stellar globe he could see infinite timespaces but he had to press into his own future before knowing in which moment his flesh lay his multifaceted memorylives surged and receded but they were his now they were like waves on a beach but if they rose too high he could command them and they would retreat leaving the royal harum behind now and again he would listen to those memorylives one would rise like a prompter poking its head up out of the stage and calling cues for his behavior his father came during the mindwalk and said you are a child seeking to be a man when you are a man you will seek in vain for the child you were all the while he felt his body being plagued by the fleas and lice of an old sietch poorly maintained none of the attendants who brought his heavily spicelaced food appeared bothered by the creatures did these people have immunity from such things or was it only that they had lived with them so long they could ignore discomfort who were these people assembled around gurney how had they come to this place was this jacurutu his multimemories produced answers he did not like they were ugly people and gurney was the ugliest perfection floated here though dormant and waiting beneath an ugly surface part of him knew he remained spicebound held in bondage by the heavy dosages of melange in every meal his childs body wanted to rebel while her persona raved with the immediate presence of memories carried over from thousands of eons his mind returned from its walk and he wondered if his body had really stayed behind spice confused the senses he felt the pressures of selflimitations piling up against him like the long barachan dunes of the bled slowly building themselves a ramp against a desert cliff one day a few trickles of sand would flow over the cliff then more and more and more and only the sand would remain exposed to the sky but the cliff would still be there underneath im still within the trance he thought he knew he would come soon to a branching of life and death his captors kept sending him back into the spice thralldom unsatisfied with his responses at every return always treacherous namri waited there with his knife leto knew countless pasts and futures but he had yet to learn what would satisfy namri or gurney halleck they wanted something outside of the visions the life and death branching lured leto his life he knew would have to possess some inner meaning which carried it above the vision circumstances thinking of this demand he felt that his inner awareness was his true being and his outer existence was the trance this terrified him he did not want to go back to the sietch with its fleas its namri its gurney halleck im a coward he thought but a coward even a coward might die bravely with nothing but a gesture where was that gesture which could make him whole once more how could he awaken from trance and vision into the universe which gurney demanded without that turning without an awakening from aimless visions he knew he could die in a prison of his own choosing in this he had at last come to cooperate with his captors somewhere he had to find wisdom an inner balance which would reflect upon the universe and return to him an image of calm strength only then might he seek his golden path and survive the skin which was not his own someone was playing the baliset out there in the sietch leto felt that his body probably heard the music in the present he sensed the cot beneath his back he could hear music it was gurney at the baliset no other fingers could quite compare with his mastery of that most difficult instrument he played an old fremen song one called a hadith because of its internal narrative and the voice which invoked those patterns required for survival on arrakis the song told the story of human occupations within a sietch leto felt the music move him through a marvelous ancient cavern he saw women trampling spice residue for fuel curding the spice for fermentation forming spicefabrics melange was everywhere in the sietch those moments came when leto could not distinguish between the music and the people of the cavern vision the whine and slap of a power loom was the whine and slap of the baliset but his inner eyes beheld fabrics of human hair the long fur of mutated rats threads of desert cotton and strips curled from the skin of birds he saw a sietch school the ecolanguage of dune raged through his mind on its wings of music he saw the sunpowered kitchen the long chamber where stillsuits were made and maintained he saw weather forecasters reading the sticks theyd brought in from the sand somewhere during this journey someone brought him food and spooned it into his mouth holding his head up with a strong arm he knew this as a realtime sensation but the marvelous play of motion continued within him as though it came in the next instant after the spiceladen food he saw the hurtling of a sandstorm moving images within the sand breath became the golden reflections of a moths eyes and his own life was reduced to the viscous trail of a crawling insect words from the panoplia prophetica raved through him it is said that there is nothing firm nothing balanced nothing durable in all the universe that nothing remains in its state that each day some time each hour brings change the old missionaria protectiva knew what they were doing he thought they knew about terrible purposes they knew how to manipulate people and religions even my father didnt escape them not in the end there lay the clue hed been seeking leto studied it he felt strength flowing back into his flesh his entire multifaceted being turned over and looked out upon the universe he sat up and found himself alone in the gloomy cell with only the light from the outer passage where the man had walked past and taken his mind an eon ago good fortune to us all he called in the traditional fremen way gurney halleck appeared in the arched doorway his head a black silhouette against the light from the outer passage bring light leto said you wish to be tested further leto laughed no its my turn to test you we shall see halleck turned away returning in a moment with a bright blue glowglobe in the crook of his left elbow he released it in the cell allowing it to drift above their heads wheres namri leto asked just outside where i can call him ahh old father eternity always waits patiently leto said he felt curiously released poised on the edge of discovery you call namri by the name reserved for shaihulud halleck asked his knifes a worms tooth leto said thus hes old father eternity halleck smiled grimly but remained silent you still wait to pass judgment on me leto said and theres no way to exchange information ill admit without making judgments you cant ask the universe to be exact though a rustling sound behind halleck alerted leto to namris approach he stopped half a pace to hallecks left ahhh the left hand of the damned leto said its not wise to joke about the infinite and the absolute namri growled he glanced sideways at halleck are you god namri that you invoke absolutes leto asked but he kept his attention on halleck judgment would come from there both men merely stared at him without answering every judgment teeters on the brink of error leto explained to claim absolute knowledge is to become monstrous knowledge is an unending adventure at the edge of uncertainty what word game is this you play halleck demanded let him speak namri said its the game namri initiated with me leto said and saw the old fremens head nod agreement hed certainly recognized the riddle game our senses always have at least two levels leto said trivia and message namri said excellent leto said you gave me trivia i give you message i see i hear i detect odors i touch i feel changes in temperature taste i sense the passage of time i may take emotive samples ahhhhh i am happy you see gurney namri theres no mystery about a human life its not a problem to be solved but a reality to be experienced you try our patience lad namri said is this the place where you wish to die but halleck put out a restraining hand first i am not a lad leto said he made the first sign at his right ear youll not slay me ive placed a water burden upon you namri drew his crysknife half out of its sheath i owe you nothing but god created arrakis to train the faithful leto said ive not only showed you my faith ive made you conscious of your own existence life requires dispute youve been made to know by me that your reality differs from all others thus you know youre alive irreverence is a dangerous game to play with me namri said he held his crysknife half drawn irreverence is a most necessary ingredient of religion leto said not to speak of its importance in philosophy irreverence is the only way left to us for testing our universe so you think you understand the universe halleck asked and he opened a space between himself and namri yeesss namri said and there was death in his voice the universe can be understood only by the wind leto said theres no mighty seat of reason which dwells within the brain creation is discovery god discovered us in the void because we moved against a background which he already knew the wall was blank then there was movement you play hide and seek with death halleck warned but you are both my friends leto said he faced namri when you offer a candidate as friend of your sietch do you not slay a hawk and an eagle as the offering and is this not the response god send each man at his end such hawks such eagles and such friends namris hand slid from his knife the blade slipped back into its sheath he stared wideeyed at leto each sietch kept its friendship ritual secret yet here was a selected part of the rite halleck though asked is this place your end i know what you need to hear from me gurney leto said watching the play of hope and suspicion across the ugly face leto touched his own breast this child was never a child my father lives within me but he is not me you loved him and he was a gallant human whose affairs beat upon high shores his intent was to close down the cycle of wars but he reckoned without the movement of infinity as expressed by life thats rhajia namri knows its movement can be seen by any mortal beware paths which narrow future possibilities such paths divert you from infinity into lethal traps what is it i need to hear from you halleck asked hes just word playing namri said but his voice carried deep hesitation doubts i ally myself with namri against my father leto said and my father within allies himself with us against what was made of him why halleck demanded because its the amor fati which i bring to humankind the act of ultimate selfexamination in this universe i choose to ally myself against any force which brings humiliation upon humankind gurney gurney you were not born and raised in the desert your flesh doesnt know the truth of which i speak but namri knows in the open land one direction is as good as another i still have not heard what i must hear halleck snarled he speaks for war and against peace namri said no leto said nor did my father speak against war but look what was made of him peace has only one meaning in this imperium its the maintenance of a single way of life you are commanded to be contented life must be uniform on all planets as it is in the imperial government the major object of priestly study is to find the correct forms of human behavior for this they go to the words of muaddib tell me namri are you content no the words came out flat spontaneous rejection then do you blaspheme of course not but you arent contented you see gurney namri proves it to us every question every problem doesnt have a single correct answer one must permit diversity a monolith is unstable then why do you demand a single correct statement from me is that to be the measure of your monstrous judgment will you force me to have you slain halleck asked and there was agony in his voice no ill have pity upon you leto said send word to my grandmother that ill cooperate the sisterhood may come to regret my cooperation but an atreides gives his word a truthsayer should test that namri said these atreides hell have his chance to say before his grandmother what must be said halleck said he nodded with his head toward the passage namri paused before leaving glanced at leto i pray we do the right thing in leaving him alive go friends leto said go and reflect as the two men departed leto threw himself onto his back feeling the cold cot against his spine movement sent his head spinning over the edge of his spiceburdened consciousness in that instant he saw the entire planet every village every town every city the desert places and the planted places all of the shapes which smashed against his vision bore intimate relationships to a mixture of elements within themselves and without he saw the structures of imperial society reflected in physical structures of its planets and their communities like a gigantic unfolding within him he saw this revelation for what it must be a window into the societys invisible parts seeing this leto realized that every system had such a window even the system of himself and his universe he began peering into windows a cosmic voyeur this was what his grandmother and the sisterhood sought he knew it his awareness flowed on a new higher level he felt the past carried in his cells in his memories in the archetypes which haunted his assumptions in the myths which hemmed him in his languages and their prehistoric detritus it was all of the shapes out of his human and nonhuman past all of the lives which he now commanded all integrated in him at last and he felt himself as a thing caught up in the ebb and flow of nucleotides against the backdrop of infinity he was a protozoan creature in which birth and death were virtually simultaneous but he was both infinite and protozoan a creature of molecular memories we humans are a form of colony organism he thought they wanted his cooperation promising cooperation had won him another reprieve from namris knife by summoning to cooperation they sought to recognize a healer and he thought but ill not bring them social order in the way they expect it a grimace contorted letos mouth he knew hed not be as unconsciously malevolent as was his father despotism at one terminal and slavery at the other but this universe might pray for those good old days his fatherwithin spoke to him then cautiously probing unable to demand attention but pleading for audience and leto answered no we will give them complexities to occupy their minds there are many modes of flight from danger how will they know im dangerous unless they experience me for thousands of years yes fatherwithin well give them question marks there is no guilt or innocence in you all of that is past guilt belabors the dead and i am not the iron hammer you multitude of the dead are merely people who have done certain things and the memory of those things illuminates my path leto ii to his memorylives after harq alada it moves of itself faradn said and his voice was barely a whisper he stood above the lady jessicas bed a brace of guards close behind him the lady jessica had propped herself up in the bed she was clad in a parasilk gown of shimmering white with a matching band around her copper hair faradn had come bursting in upon her moments before he wore the grey leotard and his face was sweaty with excitement and the exertions of his dash through the palace corridors what time is it jessica asked time faradn appeared puzzled one of the guards spoke up it is the third hour past midnight my lady the guard glanced fearfully at faradn the young prince had come dashing through the nightlighted corridors picking up startled guards in his wake but it moves faradn said he held out his left hand then his right i saw my own hands shrink into chubby fists and i remembered they were my hands when i was an infant i remembered being an infant but it was a clearer memory i was reorganizing my old memories very good jessica said his excitement was infectious and what happened when your hands became old my mind was sluggish he said i felt an ache in my back right here he touched a place over his left kidney youve learned a most important lesson jessica said do you know what that lesson is he dropped his hands to his sides stared at her then my mind controls my reality his eyes glittered and he repeated it louder this time my mind controls my reality that is the beginning of pranabindu balance jessica said it is only the beginning though what do i do next he asked my lady the guard who had answered her question ventured now to interrupt the hour he said arent their spy posts manned at this hour jessica wondered she said begone we have work to do but my lady the guard said and he looked fearfully from faradn to jessica and back you think im going to seduce him jessica asked the man stiffened faradn laughed a joyous outburst he waved a hand in dismissal you heard her begone the guards looked at each other but they obeyed faradn sat on the edge of her bed what next he shook his head i wanted to believe you yet i did not believe then it was as though my mind melted i was tired my mind gave up its fighting against you it happened just like that he snapped his fingers it was not me that your mind fought against jessica said of course not he admitted i was fighting against myself all the nonsense ive learned what next now jessica smiled i confess i didnt expect you to succeed this rapidly its been only eight days and i was patient he said grinning and youve begun to learn patience too she said begun youve just crept over the lip of this learning she said now youre truly an infant before you were only a potential not even born the corners of his mouth drew down dont be so gloomy she said youve done it thats important how many can say they were born anew what comes next he insisted you will practice this thing youve learned she said i want you able to do this at will easily later youll fill a new place in your awareness which this has opened it will be filled by the ability to test any reality against your own demands is that all i do now practice the no now you can begin the muscle training tell me can you move the little toe on your left foot without moving any other muscle of your body my she saw a distant expression come over his face as he tried to move the toe he looked down at his foot presently staring at it sweat broke out on his forehead a deep breath escaped him i cant do it yes you can she said you will learn to do it you will learn every muscle in your body you will know these muscles the way you know your hands he swallowed hard at the magnitude of this prospect then what are you doing to me what is your plan for me i intend to turn you loose upon the universe she said you will become whatever it is you most deeply desire he mulled this for a moment whatever i desire yes thats impossible unless you learn to control your desires the way you control your reality she said and she thought there let his analysis examine that theyll advise cautious approval but faradn will move a step closer to realization of what im really doing he proved his surmise by saying its one thing to tell a person hell realize his hearts desire its another thing to actually deliver that realization youve come farther than i thought jessica said very good i promise you if you complete this program of learning youll be your own man whatever you do itll be because thats what you want to do and let a truthsayer try to pry that apart she thought he stood up but the expression he bent upon her was warm a sense of camaraderie in it you know i believe you damned if i know why but i do and i wont say a word about the other things im thinking jessica watched his retreating back as he let himself out of her bedchamber she turned off the glowglobes lay back this faradn was a deep one hed as much as told her that he was beginning to see her design but he was joining her conspiracy of his own volition wait until he begins to learn his own emotions she thought with that she composed herself for the return to sleep the morrow she knew would be plagued by casual encounters with palace personnel asking seemingly innocuous questions humankind periodically goes through a speedup of its affairs thereby experiencing the race between the renewable vitality of the living and the beckoning vitiation of decadence in this periodic race any pause becomes luxury only then can one reflect that all is permitted all is possible the apocrypha of muaddib the touch of sand is important leto told himself he could feel the grit beneath him where he sat beneath a brilliant sky they had forcefed him another heavy dosage of melange and letos mind turned upon itself like a whirlpool an unanswered question lay deep within the funnel of the whirlpool why do they insist that i say it gurney was stubborn no doubt of that and hed had his orders from his lady jessica theyd brought him out of the sietch into the daylight for this lesson he had the strange sensation that hed let his body take the short trip from the sietch while his inner being mediated a battle between the duke leto i and the old baron harkonnen theyd fought within him through him because he would not let them communicate directly the fight had taught him what had happened to alia poor alia i was right to fear the spice trip he thought a welling bitterness toward the lady jessica filled him her damned gom jabbar fight it and win or die in the attempt she couldnt put a poisoned needle against his neck but she could send him into the valley of peril which had claimed her own daughter snuffling sounds intruded upon his awareness they wavered growing louder then softer louder softer there was no way for him to determine whether they had current reality or came from the spice letos body sagged over his folded arms he felt hot sand through his buttocks there was a rug directly in front of him but he sat on open sand a shadow lay across the rug namri leto stared into the muddy pattern of the rug feeling bubbles ripple there his awareness drifted on its own current through a landscape which stretched out to a horizon of shockheaded greenery his skull thrummed with drums he felt heat fever the fever was a pressure of burning which filled his senses crowding out awareness of flesh until he could only feel the moving shadows of his peril namri and the knife pressure pressure leto lay at last suspended between sky and sand his mind lost to all but the fever now he waited for something to happen sensing that any occurrence would be a firstandonly thing hothot pounding sunshine crashed brilliantly around him without tranquillity without remedy where is my golden path everywhere bugs crawled everywhere my skin is not my own he sent messages along his nerves waited out the dragging otherperson responses up head he told his nerves a head which might have been his own crept upward looked out at patches of blankness in the bright light someone whispered hes deep into it now no answer burn fire sun building heat on heat slowly outbending the current of his awareness took him drifting through a last screen of green blankness and there across low folding dunes distant no more than a kilometer beyond the stretched out chalk line of a cliff there lay the green burgeoning future upflung flowing into endless green greenswelling greengreen moving outward endlessly in all of that green there was not one great worm riches of wild growth but nowhere shaihulud leto sensed that he had ventured across old boundaries into a new land which only the imagination had witnessed and that he looked now directly through the very next veil which a yawning humankind called unknown it was bloodthirsty reality he felt the red fruit of his life swaying on a limb fluid slipping away from him and the fluid was the spice essence flowing through his veins without shaihulud no more spice he had seen a future without the great grey wormserpent of dune he knew this yet could not tear himself from the trance to rail against such a passage abruptly his awareness plunged back back back away from such a deadly future his thoughts went into his bowels becoming primitive moved only by intense emotions he found himself unable to focus on any particular aspect of his vision or his surroundings but there was a voice within him it spoke an ancient language and he understood it perfectly the voice was musical and lilting but its words bludgeoned him it is not the present which influences the future thou fool but the future which forms the present you have it all backward since the future is set an unfolding of events which will assure that future is fixed and inevitable the words transfixed him he felt terror rooted in the heavy matter of his body by this he knew his body still existed but the reckless nature and enormous power of his vision left him feeling contaminated defenseless unable to signal a muscle and gain its obedience he knew he was submitting more and more to the onslaught of those collective lives whose memories once had made him believe he was real fear filled him he thought that he might be losing the inner command falling at last into abomination leto felt his body twisting in terror he had come to depend upon his victory and the newly won benevolent cooperation of those memories they had turned against him all of them even royal harum whom hed trusted he lay shimmering on a surface which had no roots unable to give any expression to his own life he tried to concentrate upon a mental picture of himself was confronted by overlapping frames each a different age infant into doddering ancient he recalled his fathers early training let the hands grow young then old but his whole body was immersed now in this lost reality and the entire image progression melted into other faces the features of those who had given him their memories a diamond thunderbolt shattered him leto felt pieces of his awareness drifting apart yet he retained a sense of himself somewhere between being and nonbeing hope quickening he felt his body breathing in out he took in a deep breath yin he let it out yang somewhere just beyond his grasp lay a place of supreme independence a victory over all of the confusions inherent in his multitude of lives no false sense of command but a true victory he knew his previous mistake now he had sought power in the reality of his trance choosing that rather than face the fears which he and ghanima had fed in each other fear defeated alia but the seeking after power spread another trap diverting him into fantasy he saw the illusion the entire illusion process rotated half a turn and now he knew a center from which he could watch without purpose the flight of his visions of his inner lives elation flooded him it made him want to laugh but he denied himself this luxury knowing it would bar the doors of memory ahhhh my memories he thought i have seen your illusion you no longer invent the next moment for me you merely show me how to create new moments ill not lock myself on the old tracks this thought passed through his awareness as though wiping a surface clean and in its wake he felt his entire body an einfalle which reported in most minute detail on every cell every nerve he entered a state of intense quiet in this quiet he heard voices knowing they came from a great distance but he heard them clearly as though they echoed in a chasm one of the voices was hallecks perhaps we gave him too much of it namri answered we gave him exactly what she told us to give him perhaps we should go back out there and have another look at him halleck sabiha is good at such things shell call us if anything starts to go wrong namri i dont like this business of sabiha halleck shes a necessary ingredient namri leto felt bright light outside himself and darkness within but the darkness was secretive protective and warm the light began to blaze up and he felt that it came from the darkness within swirling outward like a brilliant cloud his body became transparent drawing him upward yet he retained that einfalle contact with every cell and nerve the multitude of inner lives fell into alignment nothing tangled or mixed they became very quiet in duplication of his own inner silence each memorylife discrete an entity incorporeal and undivided leto spoke to them then i am your spirit i am the only life you can realize i am the house of your spirit in the land which is nowhere the land which is your only remaining home without me the intelligible universe reverts to chaos creative and abysmal are inextricably linked in me only i can mediate between them without me mankind will sink into the mire and vanity of knowing through me you and they will find the only way out of chaos understanding by living with this he let go of himself and became himself his own person compassing the entirety of his past it was not victory not defeat but a new thing to be shared with any inner life he chose leto savored this newness letting it possess every cell every nerve giving up what the einfalle had presented to him and recovering the totality in the same instant after a time he awoke in white darkness with a flash of awareness he knew where his flesh was seated on sand about a kilometer from the cliff wall which marked the northern boundary of the sietch he knew that sietch now jacurutu for certain and fondak but it was far different from the myths and legends and the rumors which the smugglers allowed a young woman sat on a rug directly in front of him a bright glowglobe anchored to her left sleeve and drifting just above her head when leto looked away from the glowglobe there were stars he knew this young woman she was the one from his vision earlier the roaster of coffee she was namris niece as ready with a knife as namri was there was the knife in her lap she wore a simple green robe over a grey stillsuit sabiha that was her name and namri had his own plans for her sabiha saw the awakening in his eyes said its almost dawn youve spent the whole night here and most of a day he said you make good coffee this statement puzzled her but she ignored it with a singlemindedness which spoke of harsh training and explicit instructions for her present behavior its the hour of assassins leto said but your knife is no longer needed he glanced at the crysknife in her lap namri will be the judge of that she said not halleck then she only confirmed his inner knowledge shaihulud is a great garbage collector and eraser of unwanted evidence leto said ive used him thus myself she rested her hand lightly on the knife handle how much is revealed by where we sit and how we sit he said you sit upon the rug and i upon the sand her hand closed over the knife handle leto yawned a gaping and stretching which made his jaws ache ive had a vision which included you he said her shoulders relaxed slightly weve been very onesided about arrakis he said barbaric of us theres a certain momentum in what weve been doing but now we must undo some of our work the scales must be brought into better balance a puzzled frown touched sabihas face my vision he said unless we restore the dance of life here on dune the dragon on the floor of the desert will be no more because hed used the old fremen name for the great worm she was a moment understanding him then the worms were in a dark passage he said without spice the empire falls apart the guild will not move planets will slowly lose their clear memories of each other theyll turn inward upon themselves space will become a boundary when the guild navigators lose their mastery well cling to our dunetops and be ignorant of that which is above us and below us you speak very strangely she said how have you seen me in your vision trust fremen superstition he thought he said ive become pasigraphic im a living glyph to write out the changes which must come to pass if i do not write them youll encounter such heartache as no human should experience what words are these she asked but her hand remained lightly on the knife leto turned his head toward the cliffs of jacurutu seeing the beginning glow which would be second moon making its predawn passage behind the rocks the deathscream of a desert hare shocked its way through him he saw sabiha shudder there came the beating of wings a predator bird night creature here he saw the ember glow of many eyes as they swept past above him headed for crannies in the cliff i must follow the dictates of my new heart leto said you look upon me as a mere child sabiha but if they warned me about you sabiha said and now her shoulders were stiff with readiness he heard the fear in her voice said dont fear me sabiha youve lived eight more years than this flesh of mine for that i honor you but i have untold thousands more years of other lives far more than you have known dont look upon me as a child i have bridged the many futures and in one saw us entwined in love you and i sabiha what are this cant she broke off in confusion the idea could grow on you he said now help me back to the sietch for ive been in far places and am weak with the weariness of my travels namri must hear where i have been he saw the indecision in her said am i not the guest of the cavern namri must learn what i have learned we have many things to do lest our universe degenerate i dont believe that about the worms she said nor about us entwined in love she shook her head but he could see the thoughts drifting through her mind like windblown feathers his words both attracted and repelled her to be consort of power that certainly carried high allure yet there were her uncles orders but one day this son of muaddib might rule here on dune and in the farthest reaches of their universe she encountered then an extremely fremen cavernhiding aversion to such a future the consort of leto would be seen by everyone would be an object of gossip and speculations she could have wealth though and i am the son of muaddib able to see the future he said slowly she replaced her knife in its sheath lifted herself easily from the rug crossed to his side and helped him to his feet leto found himself amused by her actions then she folded the rug neatly and draped it across her right shoulder he saw her measuring the difference in their sizes reflecting upon his words entwined in love size is another thing that changes he thought she put a hand on his arm then to help him and control him he stumbled and she spoke sharply were too far from the sietch for that meaning the unwanted sound which might attract a worm leto felt that his body had become a dry shell like that abandoned by an insect he knew this shell it was one with the society which had been built upon the melange trade and its religion of the golden elixir it was emptied by its excesses muaddibs high aims had fallen into wizardry which was enforced by the military arm of auqaf muaddibs religion had another name now it was shiensanshao an ixian label which designated the intensity and insanity of those who thought they could bring the universe to paradise at the point of a crysknife but that too would change as lx had changed for they were merely the ninth planet of their sun and had even forgotten the language which had given them their name the jihad was a kind of mass insanity he muttered what sabiha had been concentrating on the problem of making him walk without rhythm hiding their presence out here on open sand she was a moment focusing on his words then interpreted them as another product of his obvious fatigue she felt the weakness of him the way hed been drained by the trance it seemed pointless and cruel to her if he were to be killed as namri said then it should be done quickly without all of this byplay leto had spoken of a marvelous revelation though perhaps that was what namri sought certainly that must be the motive behind the behavior of this childs own grandmother why else would our lady of dune give her sanction to these perilous acts against a child child again she reflected upon his words they were at the cliff base now and she stopped her charge letting him relax a moment here where it was safer looking down at him in the dim starlight she asked how could there be no more worms only i can change that he said have no fear i can change anything but its some questions have no answers he said ive seen that future but the contradictions would only confuse you this is a changing universe and we are the strangest change of all we resonate to many influences our futures need constant updating now theres a barrier which we must remove this requires that we do brutal things that we go against our most basic our dearest wishes but it must be done what must be done have you ever killed a friend he asked and turning led the way into the gap which sloped upward to the sietchs hidden entrance he moved as quickly as his trancefatigue would permit but she was right behind him clutching his robe and pulling him to a stop whats this of killing a friend hell die anyway leto said i dont have to do it but i could prevent it if i dont prevent it is that not killing him who is this who will die the alternative keeps me silent he said i might have to give my sister to a monster again he turned away from her and this time when she pulled at his robe he resisted refusing to answer her questions best she not know until the time comes he thought natural selection has been described as an environment selectively screening for those who will have progeny where humans are concerned though this is an extremely limiting viewpoint reproduction by sex tends toward experiment and innovation it raises many questions including the ancient one about whether environment is a selective agent after the variation occurs or whether environment plays a preselective role in determining the variations which it screens dune did not realty answer those questions it merely raised new questions which leto and the sisterhood may attempt to answer over the next five hundred generations the dune catastrophe after harq alada the bare brown rocks of the shield wall loomed in the distance visible to ghanima as the embodiment of that apparition which threatened her future she stood at the edge of the roof garden atop the keep the setting sun at her back the sun held a deep orange glow from intervening dust clouds a color as rich as the rim of a worms mouth she sighed thinking alia alia is your fate to be my fate the inner lives had grown increasingly clamorous of late there was something about female conditioning in a fremen society perhaps it was a real sexual difference but whatever the female was more susceptible to that inner tide her grandmother had warned about it as theyd schemed drawing on the accumulated wisdom of the bene gesserit but awakening that wisdoms threats within ghanima abomination the lady jessica had said our term for the preborn has a long history of bitter experiences behind it the way of it seems to be that the inner lives divide they split into the benign and the malignant the benign remain tractable useful the malignant appear to unite in one powerful psyche trying to take over the living flesh and its consciousness the process is known to take considerable time but its signs are well known why did you abandon alia ghanima asked i fled in terror of what id created jessica said her voice low i gave up and my burden now is that perhaps i gave up too soon what do you mean i can not explain yet but maybe no ill not give you false hopes ghafla the abominable distraction has a long history in human mythology it was called many things but chiefly it was called possession thats what it seems to be you lose your way in the malignancy and it takes possession of you leto feared the spice ghanima said finding that she could talk about him quietly the terrible price demanded of them and wisely jessica had said she would say no more but ghanima had risked an explosion of her inner memories peering past an odd blurred veil and futilely expanding on the bene gesserit fears to explain what had befallen alia did not ease it one bit the bene gesserit accumulation of experience had pointed to a possible way out of the trap though and when ghanima ventured the inner sharing she first called upon the mohalata a partnership of the benign which might protect her she recalled that sharing as she stood in the sunset glow at the edge of the keeps roof garden immediately she felt the memorypresence of her mother chani stood there an apparition between ghanima and the distant cliffs enter here and you will eat the fruit of the zaqquum the food of hell chani said bar this door my daughter it is your only safety the inner clamor lifted itself around the vision and ghanima fled sinking her consciousness into the sisterhoods credo reacting out of desperation more than trust quickly she recited the credo moving her lips letting her voice rise to a whisper religion is the emulation of the adult by the child religion is the encystment of past beliefs mythology which is guesswork the hidden assumptions of trust in the universe those pronouncements which men have made in search of personal power all of it mingled with shreds of enlightenment and always the ultimate unspoken commandment is thou shall not question but we question we break that commandment as a matter of course the work to which we have set ourselves is the liberating of the imagination the harnessing of imagination to humankinds deepest sense of creativity slowly a sense of order returned to ghanimas thoughts she felt her body trembling though and knew how fragile was this peace she had attained and that blurring veil remained in her mind leb kamai she whispered heart of my enemy you shall not be my heart and she called up a memory of faradns features the saturnine young face with its heavy brows and firm mouth hate will make me strong she thought in hate i can resist alias fate but the trembling fragility of her position remained and all she could think about was how much faradn resembled his uncle the late shaddam iv here you are it was irulan coming up from ghanimas right striding along the parapet with movements reminiscent of a man turning ghanima thought and shes shaddams daughter why will you persist in sneaking out alone irulan demanded stopping in front of ghanima and towering over her with a scowling face ghanima refrained from saying that she was not alone that guards had seen her emerge onto the roof irulans anger went to the fact that they were in the open here and that a distant weapon might find them youre not wearing a stillsuit ghanima said did you know that in the old days someone caught outside the sietch without a stillsuit was automatically killed to waste water was to endanger the tribe water water irulan snapped i want to know why you endanger yourself this way come back inside you make trouble for all of us what danger is there now ghanima asked stilgar has purged the traitors alias guards are everywhere irulan peered upward at the darkening sky stars were already visible against a greyblue backdrop she returned her attention to ghanima i wont argue i was sent to tell you we have word from faradn he accepts but for some reason he wishes to delay the ceremony how long we dont know yet its being negotiated but duncan is being sent home and my grandmother she chooses to stay on salusa for the time being who can blame her ghanima asked that silly fight with alia dont try to gull me irulan that was no silly fight ive heard the stories the sisterhoods fears are real ghanima said well youve delivered your message will you use this opportunity to have another try at dissuading me ive given up you should know better than to try lying to me ghanima said very well ill keep trying to dissuade you this course is madness and irulan wondered why she let ghanima become so irritating a bene gesserit didnt need to be irritated at anything she said im concerned by the extreme danger to you you know that ghani ghani youre pauls daughter how can you because im his daughter ghanima said we atreides go back to agamemnon and we know whats in our blood never forget that childless wife of my father we atreides have a bloody history and were not through with the blood distracted irulan asked whos agamemnon how sparse your vaunted bene gesserit education proves itself ghanima said i keep forgetting that you foreshorten history but my memories go back to she broke off best not to arouse those shades from their fragile sleep whatever you remember irulan said you must know how dangerous this course is to ill kill him ghanima said he owes me a life and ill prevent it if i can we already know this you wont get the opportunity alia is sending you south to one of the new towns until after its done irulan shook her head in dismay ghani i took my oath that id guard you against any danger ill do it with my own life if necessary if you think im going to languish in some brickwalled djedida while you theres always the huanui ghanima said speaking softly we have the deathstill as an alternative im sure you couldnt interfere from there irulan paled put a hand to her mouth forgetting for a moment all of her training it was a measure of how much care she had invested in ghanima this almost complete abandonment of everything except animal fear she spoke out of that shattering emotion allowing it to tremble on her lips ghani i dont fear for myself id throw myself into the worms mouth for you yes im what you call me the childless wife of your father but youre the child i never had i beg you tears glistened at the corners of her eyes ghanima fought down a tightness in her throat said there is another difference between us you were never fremen im nothing else this is a chasm which divides us alia knows whatever else she may be she knows this you cant tell what alia knows irulan said speaking bitterly if i didnt know her for atreides id swear she has set herself to destroy her own family and how do you know shes still atreides ghanima thought wondering at this blindness in irulan this was a bene gesserit and who knew better than they the history of abomination she would not let herself even think about it let alone believe it alia must have worked some witchery on this poor woman ghanima said i owe you a water debt for that ill guard your life but your cousins forfeit say no more of that irulan stilled the trembling of her lips wiped her eyes i did love your father she whispered i didnt even know it until he was dead perhaps he isnt dead ghanima said this preacher ghani sometimes i dont understand you would paul attack his own family ghanima shrugged looked out at the darkening sky he might find amusement in such a how can you speak so lightly of this to keep away the dark depths ghanima said i dont taunt you the gods know i dont but im just my fathers daughter im every person whos contributed seed to the atreides you wont think of abomination but i cant think of anything else im the preborn i know whats within me that foolish old superstition about dont ghanima reached a hand toward irulans mouth im every bene gesserit of their damnable breeding program up to and including my grandmother and im very much more she tore at her left palm drawing blood with a fingernail this is a young body but its experiences oh gods irulan my experiences no she put out her hand once more as irulan moved closer i know all of those futures which my father explored ive the wisdom of so many lifetimes and all the ignorance too all the frailties if youd help me irulan first learn who i am instinctively irulan bent and gathered ghanima into her arms holding her close cheek against cheek dont let me have to kill this woman ghanima thought dont let that happen as this thought swept through her the whole desert passed into night one small bird has called thee from a beak streaked crimson it cried once over sietch tabr and thou went forth unto funeral plain lament for leto ii leto awoke to the tinkle of water rings in a womans hair he looked to the open doorway of his cell and saw sabiha sitting there in the halfimmersed awareness of the spice he saw her outlined by all that his vision revealed about her she was two years past the age when most fremen women were wed or at least betrothed therefore her family was saving her for something or someone she was nubile obviously his visionshrouded eyes saw her as a creature out of humankinds terranic past dark hair and pale skin deep sockets which gave her blueinblue eyes a greenish cast she possessed a small nose and a wide mouth above a sharp chin and she was a living signal to him that the bene gesserit plan was known or suspected here in jacurutu so they hoped to revive pharaonic imperialism through him did they then what was their design to force him into marrying his sister surely sabiha could not prevent that his captors knew the plan though and how had they learned it theyd not shared its vision theyd not gone with him where life became a moving membrane in other dimensions the reflexive and circular subjectivity of the visions which revealed sabiha were his and his alone again the water rings tinkled in sabihas hair and the sound stirred up his visions he knew where he had been and what he had learned nothing could erase that he was not riding a great maker palanquin now the tinkle of water rings among the passengers a rhythm for their passage songs no he was here in the cell of jacurutu embarked on that most dangerous of all journeys away from and back to the ahl assunna waljamas from the real world of the senses and back to that world what was she doing there with the water rings tinkling in her hair oh yes she was mixing more of the brew which they thought held him captive food laced with spice essence to keep him half in and half out of the real universe until either he died or his grandmothers plan succeeded and every time he thought hed won they sent him back the lady jessica was right of course that old witch but what a thing to do the total recall of all those lives within him was of no use at all until he could organize the data and remember it at will those lives had been the raw stuff of anarchy one or all of them could have overwhelmed him the spice and its peculiar setting here in jacurutu had been a desperate gamble now gurney waits for the sign and i refuse to give it to him how long will his patience last he stared out at sabiha shed thrown her hood back and revealed the tribal tattoos at her temples leto did not recognize the tattoos at first then remembered where he was yes jacurutu still lived leto did not know whether to be thankful toward his grandmother or hate her she wanted him to have consciouslevel instincts but instincts were only racial memories of how to handle crises his direct memories of those other lives told him far more than that he had it all organized now and could see the peril of revealing himself to gurney no way of keeping the revelation from namri and namri was another problem sabiha entered the cell with a bowl in her hands he admired the way the light from outside made rainbow circles at the edges of her hair gently she raised his head and began feeding him from the bowl it was only then he realized how weak he was he allowed her to feed him while his mind went roving recalling the session with gurney and namri they believed him namri more than gurney but even gurney could not deny what his senses had already reported to him about the planet sabiha wiped his mouth with a hem of her robe ahhh sabiha he thought recalling that other vision which filled his heart with pain many nights have i dreamed beside the open water hearing the winds pass overhead many nights my flesh lay beside the snakes den and i dreamed of sabiha in the summer heat i saw her storing spicebread baked on redhot sheets of plasteel i saw the clear water in the qanat gentle and shining but a storm wind ran through my heart she sips coffee and eats her teeth shine in the shadows i see her braiding my water rings into her hair the amber fragrance of her bosom strikes through to my innermost senses she torments me and oppresses me by her very existence the pressure of his multimemories exploded the timefrozen englobement which he had tried to resist he felt twining bodies the sounds of sex rhythms laced in every sensory impression lips breathing moist breaths tongues somewhere in his vision there were helix shapes coalcolored and he felt the beat of those shapes as they turned within him a voice pleaded in his skull please please please please there was an adult beefswelling in his loins and he felt his mouth open holding clinging to the girdershape of ecstasy then a sigh a lingering groundswelling sweetness a collapse oh how sweet to let that come into existence sabiha he whispered oh my sabiha when her charge had clearly gone deeply into the trance after his food sabiha took the bowl and left pausing at the doorway to speak to namri he called my name again go back and stay with him namri said i must find halleck and discuss this with him sabiha deposited the bowl beside the doorway and returned to the cell she sat on the edge of the cot staring at letos shadowed face presently he opened his eyes and put a hand out touching her cheek he began to talk to her then telling her about the vision in which she had lived she covered his hand with her own as he spoke how sweet he was how very swee she sank onto the cot cushioned by his hand unconscious before he pulled the hand away leto sat up feeling the depths of his weakness the spice and its visions had drained him he searched through his cells for every spare spark of energy climbed from the cot without disturbing sabiha he had to go but he knew hed not get far slowly he sealed his stillsuit drew the robe around him slipped through the passage to the outer shaft there were a few people about busy at their own affairs they knew him but he was not their responsibility namri and halleck would know what he was doing sabiha could not be far away he found the kind of side passage he needed and walked boldly down it behind him sabiha slept peacefully until halleck roused her she sat up rubbed her eyes saw the empty cot saw her uncle standing behind halleck the anger on their faces namri answered the expression on her face yes hes gone how could you let him escape halleck raged how is this possible he was seen going toward the lower exit namri said his voice oddly calm sabiha cowered in front of them remembering how halleck demanded i dont know i dont know its night and hes weak namri said he wont get far halleck whirled on him you want the boy to die it wouldnt displease me again halleck confronted sabiha tell me what happened he touched my cheek he kept talking about his vision us together she looked down at the empty cot he made me sleep he put some magic on me halleck glanced at namri could he be hiding inside somewhere nowhere inside hed be found seen he was headed for the exit hes out there magic sabiha muttered no magic namri said he hypnotized her almost did it to me you remember said i was his friend hes very weak halleck said only in his body namri said he wont go far though i disabled the heel pumps of his stillsuit hell die with no water if we dont find him halleck almost turned and struck namri but held himself in rigid control jessica had warned him that namri might have to kill the lad gods below what a pass theyd come to atreides against atreides he said is it possible he just wandered away in the spice trance what difference does it make namri asked if he escapes us he must die well start searching at first light halleck said did he take a fremkit therere always a few beside the doorseal namri said hedve been a fool not to take one somehow he has never struck me as a fool then send a message to our friends halleck said tell them whats happened no messages this night namri said theres a storm coming the tribes have been tracking it for three days now itll be here by midnight already communications blanked out the satellites signed off this sector two hours ago a deep sigh shook halleck the boy would die out there for sure if the sandblast storm caught him it would eat the flesh from his bones and sliver the bones to fragments the contrived false death would become real he slapped a fist into an open palm the storm could trap them in the sietch they couldnt even mount a search and storm static had already isolated the sietch distrans he said thinking they might imprint a message onto a bats voice and dispatch it with the alarm namri shook his head bats wont fly in a storm come on man theyre more sensitive than we are theyll cower in the cliffs until its past best to wait for the satellites to pick us up again then we can try to find his remains not if he took a fremkit and hid in the sand sabiha said cursing under his breath halleck whirled away from them strode out into the sietch peace demands solutions but we never reach living solutions we only work toward them a fixed solution is by definition a dead solution the trouble with peace is that it tends to punish mistakes instead of rewarding brilliance the words of my father an account of muaddib reconstructed by harq alada shes training him shes training faradn alia glared at duncan idaho with a deliberate mix of anger and incredulity the guild heighliner had swung into orbit around arrakis at noon local an hour later the lighter had put idaho down at arrakeen unannounced but all casual and open within minutes a thopter had deposited him atop the keep warned of his impending arrival alia had greeted him there coldly formal before her guards but now they stood in her quarters beneath the north rim he had just delivered his report truthfully precisely emphasizing each datum in mentat fashion she has taken leave of her senses alia said he treated the statement as a mentat problem all the indicators are that she remains well balanced sane i should say her sanity index was stop that alia snapped what can she be thinking of idaho who knew that his own emotional balance depended now upon retreat into mentat coldness said i compute she is thinking of her granddaughters betrothal his features remained carefully bland a mask for the raging grief which threatened to engulf him there was no alia here alia was dead for a time hed maintained a mythalia before his senses someone hed manufactured out of his own needs but a mentat could carry on such selfdeception for only a limited time this creature in human guise was possessed a demonpsyche drove her his steely eyes with their myriad facets available at will reproduced upon his vision centers a multiplicity of mythalias but when he combined them into a single image no alia remained her features moved to other demands she was a shell within which outrages had been committed wheres ghanima he asked she waved the question aside ive sent her with irulan to stay in stilgars keeping neutral territory he thought theres been another negotiation with rebellious tribes shes losing ground and doesnt know it or does she is there another reason has stilgar gone over to her the betrothal alia mused what are conditions in the corrino house salusa swarms with outrine relatives all working upon faradn hoping for a share in his return to power and shes training him in the bene gesserit is it not fitting for ghanimas husband alia smiled to herself thinking of ghanimas adamant rage let faradn be trained jessica was training a corpse it would all work out i must consider this at length she said youre very quiet duncan i await your questions i see you know i was very angry with you taking her to faradn you commanded me to make it real i was forced to put out the report that youd both been taken captive she said i obeyed your orders youre so literal at times duncan you almost frighten me but if you hadnt well the lady jessicas out of harms way he said and for ghanimas sake we should be grateful that exceedingly grateful she agreed and she thought hes no longer trustworthy he has that damnable atreides loyalty i must make an excuse to send him away and have him eliminated an accident of course she touched his cheek idaho forced himself to respond to the caress taking her hand and kissing it duncan duncan how sad it is she said but i can not keep you here with me too much is happening and ive so few i can completely trust he released her hand waited i was forced to send ghanima to tabr she said things are in deep unrest here raiders from the broken lands breached the qanats at kagga basin and spilled all of their waters into the sands arrakeen was on short rations the basins alive with sandtrout yet reaping the water harvest theyre being dealt with of course but were spread very thin hed already noted how few amazons of alias guard were to be seen in the keep and he thought the maquis of the inner desert will keep on probing her defenses doesnt she know that tabr is still neutral territory she said negotiations are continuing there right now javids there with a delegation from the priesthood but id like you at tabr to watch them especially irulan she is corrino he agreed but he saw in her eyes that she was rejecting him how transparent this aliacreature had become she waved a hand go now duncan before i soften and keep you here beside me ive missed you so and ive missed you he said allowing all of his grief to flow into his voice she stared at him startled by the sadness then for my sake duncan and she thought too bad duncan she said zia will take you to tabr we need the thopter back here her pet amazon he thought i must be careful of that one i understand he said once more taking her hand and kissing it he stared at the dear flesh which once had been his alias he could not bring himself to look at her face as he left someone else stared back at him from her eyes as he mounted to the keeps roof pad idaho probed a growing sense of unanswered questions the meeting with alia had been extremely trying for the mentat part of him which kept reading data signs he waited beside the thopter with one of the keeps amazons stared grimly southward imagination took his gaze beyond the shield wall to sietch tabr why does zia take me to tabr returning a thopter is a menial task what is the delay is zia getting special instructions idaho glanced at the watchful guard mounted to the pilots position in the thopter he leaned out said tell alia ill send the thopter back immediately with one of stilgars men before the guard could protest he closed the door and started the thopter he could see her standing there indecisively who could question alias consort he had the thopter airborne before she could make up her mind what to do now alone in the thopter he allowed his grief to spend itself in great wracking sobs alia was gone they had parted forever tears flowed from his tleilaxu eyes and he whispered let all the waters of dune flow into the sand they will not match my tears this was a nonmentat excess though and he recognized it as such forcing himself to sober assessment of present necessities the thopter demanded his attention the reactions of flying brought him some relief and he had himself once more in hand ghanima with stilgar again and irulan why had zia been designated to accompany him he made it a mentat problem and the answer chilled him i was to have a fatal accident this rocky shrine to the skull of a ruler grants no prayers it has become the grave of lamentations only the wind hears the voice of this place the cries of night creatures and the passing wonder of two moons all say his day has ended no more supplicants come the visitors have gone from the feast how bare the pathway down this mountain lines at the shrine of an atreides duke anon the thing had the deceptive appearance of simplicity to leto avoiding the vision do that which has not been seen he knew the trap in his thought how the casual threads of a locked future twisted themselves together until they held you fast but he had a new grip on those threads nowhere had he seen himself running from jacurutu the thread to sabiha must be cut first he crouched now in the last daylight at the eastern edge of the rock which protected jacurutu his fremkit had produced energy tablets and food he waited now for strength to the west lay lake azrak the gypsum plain where once thered been open water in the days before the worm unseen to the east lay the bene sherk a scattering of new settlements encroaching upon the open bled to the south lay the tanzerouft the land of terror thirtyeight hundred kilometers of wasteland broken only by patches of grasslocked dunes and windtraps to water them the work of the ecological transformation remaking the landscape of arrakis they were serviced by airborne teams and no one stayed for long i will go south he told himself gurney will expect me to do that this was not the moment to do the completely unexpected it would be dark soon and he could leave this temporary hiding place he stared at the southern skyline there was a whistling of dun sky along that horizon rolling there like smoke a burning line of undulant dust a storm he watched the high center of the storm rising up out of the great flat like a questing worm for a full minute he watched the center saw that it did not move to the right or the left the old fremen saying leaped into his mind when the center does not move you are in its path that storm changed matters for a moment he stared back westward the direction of tabr feeling the deceptive greytan peace of the desert evening seeing the white gypsum pan edged by windrounded pebbles the desolate emptiness with its unreal surface of glaring white reflecting dust clouds nowhere in any vision had he seen himself surviving the grey serpent of a mother storm or buried too deeply in sand to survive there was only that vision of rolling in wind but that might come later and a storm was out there winding across many degrees of latitude whipping its world into submission it could be risked there were old stories always heard from a friend of a friend that one could lock an exhausted worm on the surface by propping a maker hook beneath one of its wide rings and having immobilized it ride out a storm in the leeward shadow there was a line between audacity and abandoned recklessness which tempted him that storm would not come before midnight at the earliest there was time how many threads could be cut here all including the final one gurney will expect me to go south but not into a storm he stared down to the south seeking a pathway saw the fluent ebony brushstroke of a deep gorge curving through jacurutus rock he saw sand curls in the bowels of the gorge chimera sand it uttered its haughty runnels onto the plain as though it were water the gritty taste of thirst whispered in his mouth as he shouldered his fremkit and let himself down onto the path which led into the canyon it was still light enough that he might be seen but he knew he was gambling with time as he reached the canyons lip the quick night of the central desert fell upon him he was left with the parched glissando of moonglow to light his way toward the tanzerouft he felt his heartbeat quicken with all of the fears which his wealth of memories provided he sensed that he might be going down into huanuinaa as fremen fears labeled the greatest storms the earths deathstill but whatever came it would be visionless every step left farther behind him the spiceinduced dhyana that spreading awareness of his intuitivecreative nature with its unfolding to the motionless chain of causality for every hundred steps he took now there must be at least one step aside beyond words and into communion with his newly grasped internal reality one way or another father im coming to you there were birds invisible in the rocks around him making themselves known by small sounds fremenwise he listened for their echoes to guide his way where he could not see often as he passed crannies he marked the baleful green of eyes creatures crouched in hiding because they knew a storm approached he emerged from the gorge onto the desert living sand moved and breathed beneath him telling of deep actions and latent fumaroles he looked back and up to the moontouched lava caps on jacurutus buttes the whole structure was metamorphic mostly pressureformed arrakis still had something to say in its own future he planted his thumper to call a worm and when it began beating against the sand took his position to watch and listen unconsciously his right hand went to the atreides hawk ring concealed in a knotted fold of his dishsasha gurney had found it but had left it what had he thought seeing pauls ring father expect me soon the worm came from the south it angled in to avoid the rocks not as large a worm as hed hoped but that could not be remedied he gauged its passage planted his hooks and went up the scaled side with a quick scrambling as it swept over the thumper in a swishing dust spray the worm turned easily under the pressure of his hooks the wind of its passage began to whip his robe he bent his gaze on the southern stars dim through dust and pointed the worm that way right into the storm as first moon rose leto gauged the storm height and put off his estimate of its arrival not before daylight it was spreading out gathering more energy for a great leap thered be plenty of work for the ecological transformation teams it was as though the planet fought them with a conscious fury out here the fury increasing as the transformation took in more land all night he pressed the worm southward sensing the reserves of its energy in the movements transmitted through his feet occasionally he let the beast fall off to the west which it was forever trying to do moved by the invisible boundaries of its territory or by a deepseated awareness of the coming storm worms buried themselves to escape the sandblast winds but this one would not sink beneath the desert while maker hooks held any of its rings open at midnight the worm was showing many signs of exhaustion he moved back along its great ridges and worked the flail allowing it to slow down but continuing to drive it southward the storm arrived just after daybreak first there was the beady stretchedout immobility of the desert dawn pressing dunes one into another next the advancing dust caused him to seal his face flaps in the thickening dust the desert became a dun picture without lines then sand needles began cutting his cheeks stinging his lids he felt the coarse grit on his tongue and knew the moment of decision had come should he risk the old stories by immobilizing the almost exhausted worm he took only a heartbeat to discard this choice worked his way back to the worms tail slacked off his hooks barely moving now the worm began to burrow but the excesses of the creatures heattransfer system still churned up a cyclone oven behind him in the quickening storm fremen children learned the dangers of this position near the worms tail with their earliest stories worms were oxygen factories fire burned wildly in their passage fed by the lavish exhalations from the chemical adaptations to friction within them sand began to whip around his feet leto loosed his hooks and leaped wide to avoid the furnace at the tail everything depended now on getting beneath the sand where the worm had loosened it grasping the static compaction tool in his left hand he burrowed into a dunes slipface knowing the worm was too tired to turn back and swallow him in its great whiteorange mouth as he burrowed with his left hand his right hand worked the stilltent from his fremkit and he readied it for inflation it was all done in less than a minute he had the tent into a hardwalled sand pocket on the lee face of a dune he inflated the tent and crawled into it before sealing the sphincter he reached out with the compaction tool reversed its action the slipface came sliding down over the tent only a few sand grains entered as he sealed the opening now he had to work even more quickly no sandsnorkel would reach up there to keep him supplied with breathing air this was a great storm the kind few survived it would cover this place with tons of sand only the tender bubble of the stilltent with its compacted outer shell would protect him leto stretched flat on his back folded his hands over his breast and sent himself into a dormancy trance where his lungs would move only once an hour in this he committed himself to the unknown the storm would pass and if it did not expose his fragile pocket he might emerge or he might enter the madinat assalam the abode of peace whatever happened he knew he had to break the threads one by one leaving him at last only the golden path it was that or he could not return to the caliphate of his fathers heirs no more would he live the lie of that desposyni that terrible caliphate chanting to the demiurge of his father no more would he keep silent when a priest mouthed offensive nonsense his crysknife will dissolve demons with this commitment letos awareness slipped into the web of timeless dao there exist obvious higherorder influences in any planetary system this is often demonstrated by introducing terraform life onto newly discovered planets in all such cases the life in similar zones develops striking similarities of adaptive form this form signifies much more than shape it connotes a survival organization and a relationship of such organizations the human quest for this interdependent order and our niche within it represents a profound necessity the quest can however be perverted into a conservative grip on sameness this has always proved deadly for the entire system the dune catastrophe after harq alada my son didnt really see the future he saw the process of creation and its relationship to the myths in which men sleep jessica said she spoke swiftly but without appearing to rush the matter she knew the hidden observers would find a way to interrupt as soon as they recognized what she was doing faradn sat on the floor outlined in a shaft of afternoon sunlight which slanted through the window behind him jessica could just see the top of a tree in the courtyard garden when she glanced across from her position standing against the far wall it was a new faradn she saw more slender more sinewy the months of training had worked their inevitable magic on him his eyes glittered when he stared at her he saw the shapes which existing forces would create unless they were diverted jessica said rather than turn against his fellow men he turned against himself he refused to accept only that which comforted him because that was moral cowardice faradn had learned to listen silently testing probing holding his questions until he had shaped them into a cutting edge she had been talking about the bene gesserit view of molecular memory expressed as ritual and had quite naturally diverged to the sisterhoods way of analyzing paul muaddib faradn saw a shadow play in her words and actions however a projection of unconscious forms at variance with the surface intent of her statements of all our observations this is the most crucial shed said life is a mask through which the universe expresses itself we assume that all of humankind and its supportive life forms represent a natural community and that the fate of all life is at stake in the fate of the individual thus when it comes to that ultimate selfexamination the amor fati we stop playing god and revert to teaching in the crunch we select individuals and we set them as free as were able he saw now where she had to be going and knowing its effect upon those who watched through the spy eyes refrained from casting an apprehensive glance at the door only a trained eye could have detected his momentary imbalance but jessica saw it and smiled a smile after all could mean anything this is a sort of graduation ceremony she said im very pleased with you faradn will you stand please he obeyed blocking off her view of the treetop through the window behind him jessica held her arms stiffly at her side said i am charged to say this to you i stand in the sacred human presence as i do now so should you stand someday i pray to your presence that this be so the future remains uncertain and so it should for it is the canvas upon which we paint our desires thus always the human condition faces a beautifully empty canvas we possess only this moment in which to dedicate ourselves continuously to the sacred presence which we share and create as jessica finished speaking tyekanik came through the door on her left moving with a false casualness which the scowl on his face belied my lord he said but it already was too late jessicas words and all of the preparation which had gone before had done their work faradn no longer was corrino he was now bene gesserit what you of the choam directorate seem unable to understand is that you seldom find real loyalties in commerce when did you last hear of a clerk giving his life for the company perhaps your deficiency rests in the false assumption that you can order men to think and cooperate this has been a failure of everything from religions to general staffs throughout history general staffs have a long record of destroying their own nations as to religions i recommend a rereading of thomas aquinas as to you of choam what nonsense you believe men must want to do things out of their own innermost drives people not commercial organizations or chains of command are what make great civilizations work every civilization depends upon the quality of the individuals it produces if you overorganize humans overlegalize them suppress their urge to greatness they can not work and their civilization collapses a letter to choam attributed to the preacher leto came out of the trance with a softness of transition which did not define one condition as separate from another one level of awareness simply moved into the other he knew where he was a restoration of energy surged through him but he sensed another message from the stale deadliness of the oxygendepleted air within the stilltent if he refused to move he knew he would remain caught in the timeless web the eternal now where all events coexisted this prospect enticed him he saw time as a convention shaped by the collective mind of all sentience time and space were categories imposed on the universe by his mind he had but to break free of the multiplicity where prescient visions lured him bold selection could change provisional futures what boldness did this moment require the trance state lured him leto felt that he had come from the alam almythal into the universe of reality only to find them identical he wanted to maintain the rihani magic of this revelation but survival demanded decisions of him his relentless taste for life sent its signals along his nerves abruptly he reached out his right hand to where he had left the sandcompaction tool he gripped it rolled onto his stomach and breached the tents sphincter a pool of sand drifted across his hand working in darkness goaded by the stale air he worked swiftly tunneling upward at a steep angle six times his body lengths he went before he broke out into darkness and clean air he slipped out onto the moonlight windface of a long curving dune found himself about a third of the way from the dunes top it was second moon above him it moved swiftly across him departing beyond the dune and the stars were laid out above him like bright rocks beside a path leto searched for the constellation of the wanderer found it and let his gaze follow the outstretched arm to the brilliant glittering of foum alhout the polar star of the south theres your damned universe for you he thought seen close up it was a hustling place like the sand all around him a place of change of uniqueness piled upon uniqueness seen from a distance only the patterns lay revealed and those patterns tempted one to belief in absolutes in absolutes we may lose our way this made him think of the familiar warning from a fremen ditty who loses his way in the tanzerouft loses his life the patterns could guide and they could trap one had to remember that patterns change he took a deep breath stirred himself into action sliding back down his passage he collapsed the tent brought it out and repacked the fremkit a wine glow began to develop along the eastern horizon he shouldered the pack climbed to the dunecrest and stood there in the chill predawn air until the rising sun felt warm on his right cheek he stained his eyepits then to reduce reflection knowing that he must woo this desert now rather than fight her when he had put the stain back into the pack he sipped from one of his catchtubes drew in a sputtering of drops and then air dropping to the sand he began going over his stillsuit coming at last to the heel pumps they had been cut cleverly with a needle knife he slipped out of the suit and repaired it but the damage had been done at least half of his bodys water was gone were it not for the stilltents catch he mused on this as he donned the suit thinking how odd it was that hed not anticipated this here was an obvious danger of visionless future leto squatted on the dunetop then pressed himself against the loneliness of this place he let his gaze wander fishing in the sand for a whistling vent any irregularity of the dunes which might indicate spice or worm activity but the storm had stamped its uniformity upon the land presently he removed a thumper from the kit armed it and sent it rotating to call shaihulud from his depths he then moved off to wait the worm was a long time coming he heard it before he saw it turned eastward where the earthshaking susurration made the air tremble waited for the first glimpse of orange from the mouth rising out of the sand the worm lifted itself from the depths in a gigantic hissing of dust which obscured its flanks the curving grey wall swept past leto and he planted his hooks went up the side in easy steps he turned the worm southward in a great curving track as he climbed under his goading hooks the worm picked up speed wind whipped his robe against him he felt himself to be goaded as the worm was goaded an intense current of creation in his loins each planet has its own period and each life likewise he reminded himself the worm was a type fremen called a growler it frequently dug in its foreplates while the tail was driving this produced rumbling sounds and caused part of its body to rise clear of the sand in a moving hump it was a fast worm though and when they picked up a following wind the furnace exhalation of his tail sent a hot breeze across him it was filled with acrid odors carried on the freshet of oxygen as the worm sped southward leto allowed his mind to run free he tried to think of this passage as a new ceremony for his life one which kept him from considering the price hed have to pay for his golden path like the fremen of old he knew hed have to adopt many new ceremonies to keep his personality from dividing into its memory parts to keep the ravening hunters of his soul forever at bay contradictory images never to be unified must now be encysted in a living tension a polarizing force which drove him from within always newness he thought i must always find the new threads out of my vision in the early afternoon his attention was caught by a protuberance ahead and slightly to the right of his course slowly the protuberance became a narrow butte an upthrust rock precisely where hed expected it now namri now sabiha let us see how your brethren take to my presence he thought this was a most delicate thread ahead of him dangerous more for its lures than its open threats the butte was a long time changing dimensions and it appeared for a while that it approached him instead of him approaching it the worm tiring now kept veering left leto slid down the immense slope to set his hooks anew and keep the giant on a straight course a soft sharpness of melange came to his nostrils the signal of a rich vein they passed the leprous blotches of violet sand where a spiceblow had erupted and he held the worm firmly until they were well past the vein the breeze redolent with the gingery odor of cinnamon pursued them for a time until leto rolled the worm onto its new course headed directly toward the rising butte abruptly colors blinked far out on the southern bled the unwary rainbow flashing of a manmade artifact in that immensity he brought up his binoculars focused the oil lenses and saw in the distance the outbanking wings of a spicescout glittering in the sunlight beneath it a big harvester was shedding its wings like a chrysalis before lumbering off when leto lowered the binoculars the harvester dwindled to a speck and he felt himself overcome by the hadhdhab the immense omnipresence of the desert it told him how those spicehunters would see him a dark object between desert and sky which was the fremen symbol for man theyd see him of course and theyd be cautious theyd wait fremen were always suspicious of one another in the desert until they recognized the newcomer or saw for certain that he posed no threat even within the fine patina of imperial civilization and its sophisticated rules they remained halftamed savages aware always that a crysknife dissolved at the death of its owner thats what can save us leto thought that wildness in the distance the spicescout banked right then left a signal to the ground he imagined the occupants scanning the desert behind him for sign that he might be more than a single rider on a single worm leto rolled the worm to the left held it until it had reversed its course dropped down the flank and leaped clear the worm released from his goading sulked on the surface for a few breaths then sank its front third and lay there recuperating a sure sign that it had been ridden too long he turned away from the worm it would stay there now the scout was circling its crawler still giving wing signals they were smugglerpaid renegades for certain wary of electronic communications the hunters would be on spice out there that was the message of the crawlers presence the scout circled once more dipped its wings came out of the circle and headed directly toward him he recognized it for a type of light thopter his grandfather had introduced on arrakis the craft circled once above him went out along the dune where he stood and banked to land against the breeze it came down within ten meters of him stirring up a scattering of dust the door on his side cracked enough to emit a single figure in a heavy fremen robe with a spear symbol at the right breast the fremen approached slowly giving each of them time to study the other the man was tall with the total indigo of spiceeyes the stillsuit mask concealed the lower half of his face and the hood had been drawn down to protect his brows the movement of the robe revealed a hand beneath it holding a maula pistol the man stopped two paces from leto looked down at him with a puzzled crinkling around the eyes good fortune to us all leto said the man peered all around scanning the emptiness then returned his attention to leto what do you here child he demanded his voice was muffled by the stillsuit mask are you trying to be the cork in a wormhole again leto used traditional fremen formula the desert is my home wenn the man demanded which way do you go i travel south from jacurutu an abrupt laugh erupted from the man well batigh you are the strangest thing ive ever seen in the tanzerouft im not your little melon leto said responding to batigh that was a label with dire overtones the little melon on the deserts edge offered its water to any finder well not drink you batigh the man said i am muriz i am the arifa of this taif he indicated with a head motion the distant spicecrawler leto noted how the man called himself the judge of his group and referred to the others as taif a band or company they were not ichwan not a band of brothers paid renegades for sure here lay the thread he required when leto remained silent muriz asked do you have a name batigh will do a chuckle shook muriz youve not told me what you do here i seek the footprints of a worm leto said using the religious phrase which said he was on hajj for his own umma his personal revelation one so young muriz asked he shook his head i dont know what to do with you you have seen us what have i seen leto asked i speak of jacurutu and you make no response riddle games muriz said what is that then he nodded toward the distant butte leto spoke from his vision only shuloch muriz stiffened and leto felt his own pulse quicken a long silence ensued and leto could see the man debating and discarding various responses shuloch in the quiet story time after a sietch meal stories of the shuloch caravanserie were often repeated listeners always assumed that shuloch was a myth a place for interesting things to happen and only for the sake of the story leto recalled a shuloch story a waif was found at the deserts edge and brought into the sietch at first the waif refused to respond to his saviors then when he spoke no one could understand his words as days passed he continued unresponsive refused to dress himself or cooperate in any way every time he was left alone he made odd motions with his hands all the specialists in the sietch were called in to study this waif but arrived at no answer then a very old woman passed the doorway saw the moving hands and laughed he only imitates his father who rolls the spicefibers into rope she explained its the way they still do it at shuloch hes just trying to feel less lonely and the moral in the old ways of shuloch there is security and a sense of belonging to the golden thread of life as muriz remained silent leto said im the waif from shuloch who knows only to move his hands in the quick movement of the mans head leto saw that muriz knew the story muriz responded slowly voice low and filled with menace are you human human as yourself leto said you speak most strangely for a child i remind you that i am a judge who can respond to the taqwa ah yes leto thought in the mouth of such a judge the taqwa carried immediate threat taqwa was the fear invoked by the presence of a demon a very real belief among older fremen the arifa knew the ways to slay a demon and was always chosen because he has the wisdom to be ruthless without being cruel to know when kindness is in fact the way to greater cruelty but this thing had come to the point which leto sought and he said i can submit to the mashhad ill be the judge of any spiritual test muriz said do you accept this bilal kaifa leto said without qualification a sly look came over murizs face he said i dont know why i permit this best you were slain out of hand but youre a small batigh and i had a son who is dead come we will go to shuloch and ill convene the isnad for a decision about you leto noting how the mans every mannerism betrayed deadly decision wondered how anyone could be fooled by this he said i know shuloch is the ahl assunna waljamas what does a child know of the real world muriz asked motioning for leto to precede him to the thopter leto obeyed but listened carefully to the sound of the fremens footsteps the surest way to keep a secret is to make people believe they already know the answer leto said people dont ask questions then it was clever of you who were cast out of jacurutu whod believe shuloch the storymyth place is real and how convenient for the smugglers or anyone else who desires access to dune murizs footsteps stopped leto turned with his back against the thopters side the wing on his left muriz stood half a pace away with his maula pistol drawn and pointed directly at leto so youre not a child muriz said a cursed midget come to spy on us i thought you spoke too wisely for a child but you spoke too much too soon not enough leto said im leto the child of paulmuaddib if you slay me you and your people will sink into the sand if you spare me ill lead you to greatness dont play games with me midget muriz snarled leto is at the real jacurutu from whence you say he broke off the gun hand dropped slightly as a puzzled frown made his eyes squint it was the hesitation leto had expected he made every muscle indication of a move to the left which deflecting his body no more than a millimeter brought the fremens gun swinging wildly against the wing edge the maula pistol flew from his hand and before he could recover leto was beside him with murizs own crysknife pressed against the mans back the tips poisoned leto said tell your friend in the thopter that hes to remain exactly where he is without moving at all otherwise ill be forced to kill you muriz nursing his injured hand shook his head at the figure in the thopter said my companion behaleth has heard you he will be as unmoving as the rock knowing he had very little time until the two worked out a plan of action or their friends came to investigate leto spoke swiftly you need me muriz without me the worms and their spice will vanish from dune he felt the fremen stiffen but how do you know of shuloch muriz asked i know they said nothing at jacurutu so you admit im leto atreides who else could you be but how do you because you are here leto said shuloch exists therefore the rest is utter simplicity you are the cast out who escaped when jacurutu was destroyed i saw you signal with your wings therefore you use no device which could be overheard at a distance you collect spice therefore you trade you could only trade with the smugglers you are a smuggler yet you are fremen you must be of shuloch why did you tempt me to slay you out of hand because you wouldve slain me anyway when wed returned to shuloch a violent rigidity came over murizs body careful muriz leto cautioned i know about you it was in your history that you took the water of unwary travelers by now this would be common ritual with you how else could you silence the ones who chanced upon you how else keep your secret batigh youd seduce me with gentle epithets and kindly words why waste any of my water upon the sand and if i were missed as were many of the others well the tanzerouft got me muriz made the hornsoftheworm sign with his right hand to ward off the rihani which letos words called up and leto knowing how older fremen distrusted mentats or anything which smacked of them by a show of extended logic suppressed a smile manri spoke of us at jacurutu muriz said i will have his water when youll have nothing but empty sand if you continue playing the fool leto said what will you do muriz when all of dune has become green grass trees and open water it will never happen it is happening before your eves leto heard murizs teeth grinding in rage and frustration presently the man grated how would you prevent this i know the entire plan of the transformation leto said i know every weakness in it every strength without me shaihulud will vanish forever a sly note returning to his voice muriz asked well why dispute it here were at a standoff you have your knife you could kill me but behaleth would shoot you not before i recovered your pistol leto said then id have your thopter yes i can fly it a scowl creased murizs forehead beneath the hood what if youre not who you say will my father not identify me leto asked ahhhh muriz said theres how you learned eh but he broke off shook his head my own son guides him he says you two have never how could so you dont believe muaddib reads the future leto said of course we believe but he says of himself that again muriz broke off and you thought him unaware of your distrust leto said i came to this exact place in this exact time to meet you muriz i know all about you because ive seen you and your son i know how secure you believe yourselves how you sneer at muaddib how you plot to save your little patch of desert but your little patch of desert is doomed without me muriz lost forever it has gone too far here on dune my father has almost run out of vision and you can only turn to me that blind muriz stopped swallowed hell return soon from arrakeen leto said and then we shall see how blind he is how far have you gone from the old fremen ways muriz what he is wadquiyas with you your people found him alone in the desert and brought him to shuloch what a rich discovery he was richer than a spicevein wadquiyas he has lived with you his water mingled with your tribes water hes part of your spirit river leto pressed the knife hard against murizs robe careful muriz leto lifted his left hand released the fremens face flap dropped it knowing what leto planned muriz said where would you go if you killed us both back to jacurutu leto pressed the fleshy part of his own thumb against murizs mouth bite and drink muriz that or die muriz hesitated then bit viciously into letos flesh leto watched the mans throat saw the swallowing convulsion withdrew the knife and returned it wadquiyas leto said i must offend the tribe before you can take my water muriz nodded your pistol is over there leto gestured with his chin you trust me now muriz asked how else can i live with the cast out again leto saw the sly look in murizs eyes but this time it was a measuring thing a weighing of economics the man turned away with an abruptness which told of secret decisions recovered his maula pistol and returned to the wing step come he said we tarry too long in a worms lair the future of prescience can not always be locked into the rules of the past the threads of existence tangle according to many unknown laws prescient future insists on its own rules it will not conform to the ordering of the zensunni nor to the ordering of science prescience builds a relative integrity it demands the work of this instant always warning that you can not weave every thread into the fabric of the past kalima the words of muaddib the shuloch commentary muriz brought the ornithopter in over shuloch with a practiced ease leto seated beside him felt the armed presence of behaleth behind them everything went on trust now and the narrow thread of his vision to which he clung if that failed allahu akbahr sometimes one had to submit to a greater order the butte of shuloch was impressive in this desert its unmarked presence here spoke of many bribes and many deaths of many friends in high places leto could see at shulochs heart a cliffwalled pan with interfringing blind canyons leading down into it a thick growth of shadescale and salt bushes lined the lower edges of these canyons with an inner ring of fan palms indicating the water riches of this place crude buildings of greenbush and spicefiber had been built out from the fan palms the buildings were green buttons scattered on the sand there would live the cast out of the cast out those who could go no lower except into death muriz landed in the pan near the base of one of the canyons a single structure stood on the sand directly ahead of the thopter a thatch of desert vines and bejato leaves all lined with heatfused spicefabric it was the living replica of the first crude stilltents and it spoke of degradation for some who lived in shuloch leto knew the place would leak moisture and would be full of nightbiters from the nearby growth so this was how his father lived and poor sabiha here would be her punishment at murizs order leto let himself out of the thopter jumped down to the sand and strode toward the hut he could see many people working farther toward the canyon among the palms they looked tattered poor and the fact that they barely glanced at him or at the thopter said much of the oppression here leto could see the rock lip of a qanat beyond the workers and there was no mistaking the sense of moisture in this air open water passing the hut leto saw it was as crude as hed expected he pressed on to the qanat peered down and saw the swirl of predator fish in the dark flow the workers avoiding his eyes went on with clearing sand away from the line of rock openings muriz came up behind leto said you stand on the boundary between fish and worm each of these canyons has its worm this qanat has been opened and we will remove the fish presently to attract sandtrout of course leto said holding pens you sell sandtrout and worms offplanet it was muaddibs suggestion i know but none of your worms or sandtrout survive for long away from dune not yet muriz said but someday not in ten thousand years leto said and he turned to watch the turmoil on murizs face questions flowed there like the water in the qanat could this son of muaddib really read the future some still believed muaddib had done it but how could a thing such as this be judged presently muriz turned away led them back to the hut he opened the crude doorseal motioned for leto to enter there was a spiceoil lamp burning against the far wall and a small figure squatted beneath it back to the door the burning oil gave off a heavy fragrance of cinnamon theyve sent down a new captive to care for muaddibs sietch muriz sneered if she serves well she may keep her water for a time he confronted leto some think it evil to take such water those laceshirt fremen now make rubbish heaps in their new towns rubbish heaps when has dune ever before seen rubbish heaps when we get such as this one he gestured toward the figure by the lamp theyre usually half wild with fear lost to their own kind and never accepted by true fremen do you understand me letobatigh i understand you the crouching figure had not moved you speak of leading us muriz said fremen are led by men whove been blooded what could you lead us in kralizec leto said keeping his attention on the crouched figure muriz glared at him brows contracted over his indigo eyes kralizec that wasnt merely war or revolution that was the typhoon struggle it was a word from the furthermost fremen legends the battle at the end of the universe kralizec the tall fremen swallowed convulsively this sprat was as unpredictable as a city dandy muriz turned to the squatting figure woman liban wahid he commanded bring us the spicedrink she hesitated do as he says sabiha leto said she jumped to her feet whirling she stared at him unable to take her gaze from his face you know this one muriz asked she is namris niece she offended jacurutu and they have sent her to you namri but liban wahid leto said she rushed past them tore herself through the doorseal and they heard the sound of her running feet she will not go far muriz said he touched a finger to the side of his nose a kin of namri eh interesting what did she do to offend she allowed me to escape leto turned then and followed sabiha he found her standing at the edge of the qanat leto moved up beside her and looked down at the water there were birds in the nearby fan palms and he heard their calls their wings the workers made scraping sounds as they moved sand still he did as sabiha did looking down deep into the water and its reflections the corners of his eyes saw blue parakeets in the palm fronds one flew across the qanat and he saw it reflected in a silver swirl of fish all run together as though birds and predators swam in the same firmament sabiha cleared her throat you hate me leto said you shamed me you shamed me before my people they held an isnad and sent me here to lose my water all because of you muriz laughed from close behind them and now you see letobatigh that our spirit river has many tributaries but my water flows in your veins leto said turning that is no tributary sabiha is the fate of my vision and i follow her i fled across the desert to find my future here in shuloch you and he pointed at sabiha threw his head back in laughter it will not be as either of you might believe leto said remember this muriz i have found the footprints of my worm he felt tears swimming in his eyes then he gives water to the dead sabiha whispered even muriz stared at him in awe fremen never cried unless it was the most profound gift of the soul almost embarrassed muriz closed his mouthseal pulled his djeballa hood low over his brows leto peered beyond the man said here in shuloch they still pray for dew at the deserts edge go muriz and pray for kralizec i promise you it will come fremen speech implies great concision a precise sense of expression it is immersed in the illusion of absolutes its assumptions are a fertile ground for absolutist religions furthermore fremen are fond of moralizing they confront the terrifying instability of all things with institutionalized statements they say we know there is no summa of all attainable knowledge that is the preserve of god but whatever men can learn men can contain out of this knifeedged approach to the universe they carve a fantastic belief in signs and omens and in their own destiny this is an origin of their kralizec legend the war at the end of the universe bene gesserit private reportsfolio they have him securely in a safe place namri said smiling across the square stone room at gurney halleck you may report this to your friends where is this safe place halleck asked he didnt like namris tone felt constrained by jessicas orders damn the witch her explanations made no sense except the warning about what could happen if leto failed to master his terrible memories its a safe place namri said thats all im permitted to tell you how do you know this ive had a distrans sabiha is with him sabiha shell just let him not this time are you going to kill him thats no longer up to me halleck grimaced distrans what was the range of those damned cave bats hed often seen them flitting across the desert with hidden messages imprinted upon their squeaking calls but how far would they go on this hellhole planet i must see him for myself halleck said thats not permitted halleck took a deep breath to quiet himself he had spent two days and two nights waiting for search reports now it was another morning and he felt his role dissolving around him leaving him naked he had never liked command anyway command always waited while others did the interesting and dangerous things why isnt it permitted he asked the smugglers whod arranged this safesietch had left too many questions unanswered and he wanted no more of the same from namri some believe you saw too much when you saw this sietch namri said halleck heard the menace relaxed into the easy stance of the trained fighter hand near but not on his knife he longed for a shield but that had been ruled out by its effect on the worms its short life in the presence of stormgenerated static charges this secrecy isnt part of our agreement halleck said if id killed him would that have been part of our agreement again halleck felt the jockeying of unseen forces about which the lady jessica hadnt warned him this damned plan of hers maybe it was right not to trust the bene gesserit immediately he felt disloyal shed explained the problem and hed come into her plan with the expectation that it like all plans would need adjustments later this wasnt any bene gesserit this was jessica of the atreides whod never been other than friend and supporter to him without her he knew hed have been adrift in a universe more dangerous than the one he now inhabited you cant answer my question namri said you were to kill him only if he showed himself to be possessed halleck said abomination namri put his fist beside his right ear your lady knew we had tests for such wise of her to leave that judgment in my hands halleck compressed his lips in frustration you heard the reverend mothers words to me namri said we fremen understand such women but you offworlders never understand them fremen women often send their sons to death halleck spoke past still lips are you telling me youve killed him he lives he is in a safe place hell continue to receive the spice but im to escort him back to his grandmother if he survives halleck said namri merely shrugged halleck understood that this was all the answer hed get damn he couldnt go back to jessica with such unanswered questions he shook his head why question what you can not change namri asked youre being well paid halleck scowled at the man fremen they believed all foreigners were influenced primarily by money but namri was speaking more than fremen prejudice other forces were at work here and that was obvious to one whod been trained in observation by a bene gesserit this whole thing had the smell of a feint within a feint within a feint shifting to the insultingly familiar form halleck said the lady jessica will be wrathful she could send cohorts against zanadiq namri cursed you office messenger you stand outside the mohalata i take pleasure in possessing your water for the noble people halleck rested a hand on his knife readied his left sleeve where hed prepared a small surprise for attackers i see no water spilled here he said perhaps youre blinded by your pride you live because i wished you to learn before dying that your lady jessica will not send cohorts against anyone you are not to be lured quietly into the huanui offworld scum i am of the noble people and you and im just a servant of the atreides halleck said voice mild were the scum who lifted the harkonnen yoke from your smelly neck namri showed white teeth in a grimace your lady is prisoner on salusa secundus the notes you thought were from her came from her daughter by extreme effort halleck managed to keep his voice even no matter alia will namri drew his crysknife what do you know of the womb of heaven i am her servant you male whore i do her bidding when i take your water and he lunged across the room with foolhardy directness halleck not allowing himself to be tricked by such seeming clumsiness flicked up the left arm of his robe releasing the extra length of heavy fabric hed had sewn there letting that take namris knife in the same movement halleck swept the folds of cloth over namris head came in under and through the cloth with his own knife aimed directly for the face he felt the point bite home as namris body hit him with a hard surface of metal armor beneath the robe the fremen emitted one outraged squeal jerked backward and fell he lay there blood gushing from his mouth as his eyes glared at halleck then slowly dulled halleck blew air through his lips how could that fool namri have expected anyone to miss the presence of armor beneath a robe halleck addressed the corpse as he recovered the trick sleeve wiped his knife and sheathed it how did you think we atreides servants were trained fool he took a deep breath thinking well now whose feint am i thered been the ring of truth in namris words jessica a prisoner of the corrinos and alia working her own devious schemes jessica herself had warned of many contingencies with alia as enemy but had not predicted herself as prisoner he had his orders to obey though first there was the necessity of getting away from this place luckily one robed fremen looked much like another he rolled namris body into a corner threw cushions over it moved a rug to cover the blood when it was done halleck adjusted the nose and mouth tubes of his stillsuit brought up the mask as one would in preparing for the desert pulled the hood of his robe forward and went out into the long passage the innocent move without care he thought setting his pace at an easy saunter he felt curiously free as though hed moved out of danger not into it i never did like her plan for the boy he thought and ill tell her so if i see her if because if namri spoke the truth the most dangerous alternate plan went into effect alia wouldnt let him live long if she caught him but there was always stilgar a good fremen with a good fremens superstitions jessica had explained it theres a very thin layer of civilized behavior over stilgars original nature and heres how you take that layer off him the spirit of muaddib is more than words more than the letter of the law which arises in his name muaddib must always be that inner outrage against the complacently powerful against the charlatans and the dogmatic fanatics it is that inner outrage which must have its say because muaddib taught us one thing above all others that humans can endure only in a fraternity of social justice the fedaykin compact leto sat with his back against the wall of the hut his attention on sabiha watching the threads of his vision unroll she had prepared the coffee and set it aside now she squatted across from him stirring his evening meal it was a gruel redolent with melange her hands moved quickly with the ladle and liquid indigo stained the sides of his bowl she bent her thin face over the bowl blending in the concentrate the crude membrane which made a stilltent of the hut had been patched with lighter material directly behind her and this formed a grey halo against which her shadow danced in the flickering light of the cooking flame and the single lamp that lamp intrigued leto these people of shuloch were profligate with spiceoil a lamp not a glowglobe they kept slave outcasts within their walls in the fashion told by the most ancient fremen traditions yet they employed ornithopters and the latest spice harvesters they were a crude mixture of ancient and modern sabiha pushed the bowl of gruel toward him extinguished the cooking flame leto ignored the bowl i will be punished if you do not eat this she said he stared at her thinking if i kill her thatll shatter one vision if i tell her murizs plans thatll shatter another vision if i wait here for my father this visionthread will become a mighty rope his mind sorted the threads some held a sweetness which haunted him one future with sabiha carried alluring reality within his prescient awareness it threatened to block out all others until he followed it out to its ending agonies why do you stare at me that way she asked still he did not answer she pushed the bowl closer to him leto tried to swallow in a dry throat the impulse to kill sabiha welled in him he found himself trembling with it how easy it would be to shatter one vision and let the wildness run free muriz commands this she said touching the bowls yes muriz commanded it superstition conquered everything muriz wanted a vision cast for him to read he was an ancient savage asking the witch doctor to throw the ox bones and interpret their sprawl muriz had taken his captives stillsuit as a simple precaution thered been a sly jibe at namri and sabiha in that comment only fools let a prisoner escape muriz had a deep emotional problem though the spirit river the captives water flowed in murizs veins muriz sought a sign that would permit him to hold a threat of death over leto like father like son leto thought the spice will only give you visions sabiha said the long silences made her uneasy ive had visions in the orgy many times they dont mean anything thats it he thought his body locking itself into a stillness which left his skin cold and clammy the bene gesserit training took over his consciousness a pinpoint illumination which fanned out beyond him to throw the blazoning light of vision upon sabiha and all of her cast out fellows the ancient bene gesserit learning was explicit languages build up to reflect specializations in a way of life each specialization may be recognized by its words by its assumptions and sentence structures look for stoppages specializations represent places where life is being stopped where the movement is dammed up and frozen he saw sabiha then as a visionmaker in her own right and every other human carried the same power yet she was disdainful of her spiceorgy visions they caused disquiet and therefore must be put aside forgotten deliberately her people prayed to shaihulud because the worm dominated many of their visions they prayed for dew at the deserts edge because moisture limited their lives yet they wallowed in spice wealth and lured sandtrout to open qanats sabiha fed him prescient visions with a casual callousness yet within her words he saw the illuminated signals she depended upon absolutes sought finite limits and all because she couldnt handle the rigors of terrible decisions which touched her own flesh she clung to her oneeyed vision of the universe englobing and timefreezing as it might be because the alternatives terrified her in contrast leto felt the pure movement of himself he was a membrane collecting infinite dimensions and because he saw those dimensions he could make the terrible decisions as my father did you must eat this sabiha said her voice petulant leto saw the whole pattern of the visions now and knew the thread he must follow my skin is not my own he stood pulling his robe around him it felt strange against his flesh with no stillsuit protecting his body his feet were bare upon the fused spicefabric of the floor feeling the sand tracked in there whatre you doing sabiha demanded the air is bad in here im going outside you cant escape she said every canyon has its worm if you go beyond the qanat the worms will sense you by your moisture these captive worms are very alert not like the ones in the desert at all besides how gloating her voice became youve no stillsuit then why do you worry he asked wondering if he might yet provoke a real reaction from her because youve not eaten and youll be punished yes but im already saturated with spice he said every moment is a vision he gestured with a bare foot at the bowl pour that onto the sand wholl know they watch she whispered he shook his head shedding her from his visions feeling new freedom envelop him no need to kill this poor pawn she danced to other music not even knowing the steps believing that she might yet share the power which lured the hungry pirates of shuloch and jacurutu leto went to the doorseal put a hand upon it when muriz comes she said hell be very angry with muriz is a merchant of emptiness leto said my aunt has drained him she got to her feet im going out with you and he thought she remembers how i escaped her now she feels the fragility of her hold upon me her visions stir within her but she would not listen to those visions she had but to reflect how could he outwit a captive worm in its narrow canyon how could he live in the tanzerouft without stillsuit or fremkit i must be alone to consult my visions he said youll remain here where will you go to the qanat the sandtrout come out in swarms at night they wont eat me sometimes the worm comes down to just beyond the water she said if you cross the qanat she broke off trying to edge her words with menace how could i mount a worm without hooks he asked wondering if she still could salvage some bit of her visions will you eat when you return she asked squatting once more by the bowl recovering the ladle and stirring the indigo broth everything in its own time he said knowing shed be unable to detect his delicate use of voice the way he insinuated his own desires into her decisionmaking muriz will come and see if youve had a vision she warned i will deal with muriz in my own way he said noting how heavy and slow her movements had become the pattern of all fremen lent itself naturally into the way he guided her now fremen were people of extraordinary energy at sunrise but a deep and lethargic melancholy often overcame them at nightfall already she wanted to sink into sleep and dreams leto let himself out into the night alone the sky glittered with stars and he could make out the bulk of surrounding butte against their pattern he went up under the palms to the qanat for a long time leto squatted at the qanats edge listening to the restless hiss of sand within the canyon beyond a small worm by the sound of it chosen for that reason no doubt a small worm would be easier to transport he thought about the worms capture the hunters would dull it with a water mist using the traditional fremen method of taking a worm for the orgytransformation rite but this worm would not be killed by immersion this one would go out on a guild heighliner to some hopeful buyer whose desert probably would be too moist few offworlders realized the basic desiccation which the sandtrout had maintained on arrakis had maintained because even here in the tanzerouft there would be many times more airborne moisture than any worm had ever before known short of its death in a fremen cistern he heard sabiha stirring in the hut behind him she was restless prodded by her own suppressed visions he wondered how it would be to live outside a vision with her sharing each moment just as it came of itself the thought attracted him far more strongly than had any spice vision there was a certain cleanliness about facing an unknown future a kiss in the sietch is worth two in the city the old fremen maxim said it all the traditional sietch had held a recognizable wildness mingled with shyness there were traces of that shyness in the people of jacurutushuloch but only traces this saddened him by revealing what had been lost slowly so slowly that the knowledge was fully upon him before he recognized its beginnings leto grew aware of the soft rustling of many creatures all around him sandtrout soon it would be time to shift from one vision to another he felt the movement of sandtrout as a movement within himself fremen had lived with the strange creatures for generations knowing that if you risked a bit of water as bait you could lure them into reach many a fremen dying of thirst had risked his last few drops of water in this gamble knowing that the sweet green syrup teased from a sandtrout might yield a small profit in energy but the sandtrout were mostly the game of children who caught them for the huanui and for play leto shuddered at the thought of what that play meant to him now he felt one of the creatures slither across his bare foot it hesitated then went on attracted by the greater amount of water in the qanat for a moment though hed felt the reality of his terrible decision the sandtrout glove it was the play of children if one held a sandtrout in the hand smoothing it over your skin it formed a living glove traces of blood in the skins capillaries could be sensed by the creatures but something mingled with the bloods water repelled them sooner or later the glove would slip off into the sand there to be lifted into a spicefiber basket the spice soothed them until they were dumped into the deathstill he could hear sandtrout dropping into the qanat the swirl of predators eating them water softened the sandtrout made it pliable children learned this early a bit of saliva teased out the sweet syrup leto listened to the splashing this was a migration of sandtrout come up to the open water but they could not contain a flowing qanat patrolled by predator fish still they came still they splashed leto groped on the sand with his right hand until his fingers encountered the leathery skin of a sandtrout it was the large one he had expected the creature didnt try to evade him but moved eagerly onto his flesh he explored its outline with his free hand roughly diamondshaped it had no head no extremities no eyes yet it could find water unerringly with its fellows it could join body to body locking one on another by the coarse interlacings of extruded cilia until the whole became one large sackorganism enclosing the water walling off the poison from the giant which the sandtrout would become shaihulud the sandtrout squirmed on his hand elongating stretching as it moved he felt a counterpart elongating and stretching of the vision he had chosen this thread not that one he felt the sandtrout becoming thin covering more and more of his hand no sandtrout had ever before encountered a hand such as this one every cell supersaturated with spice no other human had ever before lived and reasoned in such a condition delicately leto adjusted his enzyme balance drawing on the illuminated sureness hed gained in spice trance the knowledge from those uncounted lifetimes which blended themselves within him provided the certainty through which he chose the precise adjustments slaving off the death from an overdose which would engulf him if he relaxed his watchfulness for only a heartbeat and at the same time he blended himself with the sandtrout feeding on it feeding it learning it his trance vision provided the template and he followed it precisely leto felt the sandtrout grow thin spreading itself over more and more of his hand reaching up his arm he located another placed it over the first one contact ignited a frenzied squirming in the creatures their cilia locked and they became a single membrane which enclosed him to the elbow the sandtrout adjusted to the living glove of childhood play but thinner and more sensitive as he lured it into the role of a skin symbiote he reached down with the living glove felt sand each grain distinct to his senses this was no longer sandtrout it was tougher stronger and it would grow stronger and stronger his groping hand encountered another sandtrout which whipped itself into union with the first two and adapted itself to the new role leathery softness insinuated itself up his arm to his shoulder with a terrible singleness of concentration he achieved the union of his new skin with his body preventing rejection no corner of his attention was left to dwell upon the terrifying consequences of what he did here only the necessities of his trance vision mattered only the golden path could come from this ordeal leto shed his robe and lay naked upon the sand his gloved arm outstretched into the path of migrating sandtrout he remembered that once he and ghanima had caught a sandtrout abraded it against the sand until it contracted into the childworm a stiff tube its interior pregnant with the green syrup one bit gently upon the end and sucked swiftly before the wound was healed gaining the few drops of sweetness they were all over his body now he could feel the pulse of his blood against the living membrane one tried to cover his face but he moved it roughly until it elongated into a thin roll the thing grew much longer than the childworm remaining flexible leto bit the end of it tasted a thin stream of sweetness which continued far longer than any fremen had ever before experienced he could feel energy from the sweetness flow through him a curious excitement suffused his body he was kept busy for a time rolling the membrane away from his face until hed built up a stiff ridge circling from jaw to forehead and leaving his ears exposed now the vision must be tested he got to his feet turned to run back toward the hut and as he moved found his feet moving too fast for him to balance he plunged into the sand rolled and leaped to his feet the leap took him two meters off the sand and when he fell back trying to walk he again moved too fast stop he commanded himself he fell into the pranabindu forced relaxation gathering his senses into the pool of consciousness this focused the inward ripples of the constantnow through which he experienced time and he allowed the visionelation to warm him the membrane worked precisely as the vision had predicted my skin is not my own but his muscles took some training to live with this amplified movement when he walked he fell rolling presently he sat in the quiet the ridge below his jaw tried to become a membrane covering his mouth he spat against it and bit tasting the sweet syrup it rolled downward to the pressure of his hand enough time had passed to form the union with his body leto stretched flat and turned onto his face he began to crawl rasping the membrane against the sand he could feel the sand distinctly but nothing abraded his own flesh with only a few swimming movements he traversed fifty meters of sand the physical reaction was a frictioninduced warming sensation the membrane no longer tried to cover his nose and mouth but now he faced the second major step onto his golden path his exertions had taken him beyond the qanat into the canyon where the trapped worm stayed he heard it hissing toward him attracted by his movements leto leaped to his feet intending to stand and wait but the amplified movement sent him sprawling twenty meters farther into the canyon controlling his reactions with terrible effort he sat back onto his haunches straightened now the sand began to swell directly in front of him rising up in a monstrous starlit curve sand opened only two body lengths from him crystal teeth flashed in the dim light he saw the yawning mouthcavern with far back the ambient movement of dim flame the overpowering redolence of the spice swept over him but the worm had stopped it remained in front of him as first moon lifted over the butte the light reflected off the worms teeth outlining the faery glow of chemical fires deep within the creature so deep was the inbred fremen fear that leto found himself torn by a desire to flee but his vision held him motionless fascinated by this prolonged moment no one had ever before stood this close to the mouth of a living worm and survived gently leto moved his right foot met a sand ridge and reacting too quickly was propelled toward the worms mouth he came to a stop on his knees still the worm did not move it sensed only the sandtrout and would not attack the deepsand vector of its own kind the worm would attack another worm in its territory and would come to exposed spice only a water barrier stopped it and sandtrout encapsulating water were a water barrier experimentally leto moved a hand toward that awesome mouth the worm drew back a full meter confidence restored leto turned away from the worm and began teaching his muscles to live with their new power cautiously he walked back toward the qanat the worm remained motionless behind him when leto was beyond the water barrier he leaped with joy went sailing ten meters across the sand sprawled rolled laughed light flared on the sand as the huts doorseal was breached sabiha stood outlined in the yellow and purple glow of the lamp staring out at him laughing leto ran back across the qanat stopped in front of the worm turned and faced her with his arms outstretched look he called the worm does my bidding as she stood in frozen shock he whirled went racing around the worm and into the canyon gaining experience with his new skin he found he could run with only the lightest flexing of muscles it was almost effortless when he put effort into running he raced over the sand with the wind burning the exposed circle of his face at the canyons dead end instead of stopping he leaped up a full fifteen meters clawed at the cliff scrabbled climbing like an insect and came out on the crest above the tanzerouft the desert stretched before him a vast silvery undulance in the moonlight letos manic exhilaration receded he squatted sensing how light his body felt exertion had produced a slick film of perspiration which a stillsuit would have absorbed and routed into the transfer tissue which removed the salts even as he relaxed the film disappeared now absorbed by the membrane faster than a stillsuit could have done it thoughtfully leto rolled a length of the membrane beneath his lips pulled it into his mouth and drank the sweetness his mouth was not masked though fremenwise he sensed his bodys moisture being wasted with every breath leto brought a section of the membrane over his mouth rolled it back when it tried to seal his nostrils kept at this until the rolled barrier remained in place in the desert way he fell into the automatic breathing pattern in through his nose out through his mouth the membrane over his mouth protruded in a small bubble but remained in place no moisture collected on his lips and his nostrils remained open the adaptation proceeded then a thopter flew between leto and the moon banked and came in for a spreadwing landing on the butte perhaps a hundred meters to his left leto glanced at it turned and looked back the way he had come up the canyon many lights could be seen down there beyond the qanat a stirring of a multitude he heard faint outcries sensed hysteria in the sounds two men approached him from the thopter moonlight glinted on their weapons the mashhad leto thought and it was a sad thought here was the great leap onto the golden path he had put on the living selfrepairing stillsuit of a sandtrout membrane a thing of unmeasurable value on arrakis until you understood the price i am no longer human the legends about this night will grow and magnify it beyond anything recognizable by the participants but it will become truth that legend he peered down from the butte estimated the desert floor lay two hundred meters below the moon picked out ledges and cracks on the steep face but no connecting pathway leto stood inhaled a deep breath glanced back at the approaching men then stepped to the cliffs edge and launched himself into space some thirty meters down his flexed legs encountered a narrow ledge amplified muscles absorbed the shock and rebounded in a leap sideways to another ledge where he caught a narrow outcropping with his hands dropped twenty meters leaped to another handhold and once more went down bouncing leaping grasping tiny ledges he took the final forty meters in one jump landing in a bentknee roll which sent him plunging down the slipface of a dune in a shower of sand and dust at the bottom he scrambled to his feet launched himself to the next dunecrest in one jump he could hear hoarse shouts from atop the cliff but ignored them to concentrate on the leaping strides from dunetop to dunetop as he grew more accustomed to amplified muscles he found a sensuous joy that he had not anticipated in this distancegulping movement it was a ballet on the desert defiance of the tanzerouft which no other had ever experienced when he judged that the ornithopters occupants had overcome their shock enough to mount pursuit once more he dove for the moonshadowed face of a dune burrowed into it the sand was like heavy liquid to his new strength but the temperature mounted dangerously when he moved too fast he broke free on the far face of the dune found that the membrane had covered his nostrils he removed it sensed the new skin pulsing over his body in its labor to absorb his perspiration leto fashioned a tube at his mouth drank the syrup while he peered upward at the starry sky he estimated he had come fifteen kilometers from shuloch presently a thopter drew its pattern across the stars a great bird shape followed by another and another he heard the soft swishing of their wings the whisper of their muted jets sipping at the living tube he waited first moon passed through its track then second moon an hour before dawn leto crept out and up to the dunecrest examined the sky no hunters now he knew himself to be embarked upon a path of no return ahead lay the trap in time and space which had been prepared as an unforgettable lesson for himself and all of mankind leto turned northeast and loped another fifty kilometers before burrowing into the sand for the day leaving only a tiny hole to the surface which he kept open with a sandtrout tube the membrane was learning how to live with him as he learned how to live with it he tried not to think of the other things it was doing to his flesh tomorrow ill raid gara rulen he thought ill smash their qanat and loose its water into the sand then ill go on to windsack old gap and harg in a month the ecological transformation will have been set back a full generation thatll give us space to develop the new timetable and the wildness of the rebel tribes would be blamed of course some would revive memories of jacurutu alia would have her hands full as for ghanima silently to himself leto mouthed the words which would restore her memory time for that later if they survived this terrible mixing of threads the golden path lured him out there on the desert almost a physical thing which he could see with his open eyes and he thought how it was as animals must move across the land their existence dependent upon that movement the soul of humankind blocked for eons needed a track upon which it could move he thought of his father then telling himself soon well dispute as man to man and only one vision will emerge limits of survival are set by climate those long drifts of change which a generation may fail to notice and it is the extremes of climate which set the pattern lonely finite humans may observe climatic provinces fluctuations of annual weather and occasionally may observe such things as this is a colder year than ive ever known such things are sensible but humans are seldom alerted to the shifting average through a great span of years and it is precisely in this alerting that humans learn how to survive on any planet they must learn climate arrakis the transformation after harq alada alia sat crosslegged on her bed trying to compose herself by reciting the litany against fear but chuckling derision echoed in her skull to block every effort she could hear the voice it controlled her ears her mind what nonsense is this what have you to fear the muscles of her calves twitched as her feet tried to make running motions there was nowhere to run she wore only a golden gown of the sheerest palian silk and it revealed the plumpness which had begun to bulge her body the hour of assassins had just passed dawn was near reports covering the past three months lay before her on the red coverlet she could hear the humming of the air conditioner and a small breeze stirred the labels on the shigawire spools aides had awakened her fearfully two hours earlier bringing news of the latest outrage and alia had called for the report spools seeking an intelligible pattern she gave up on the litany these attacks had to be the work of rebels obviously more and more of them turned against muaddibs religion and whats wrong with that the derisive voice asked within her alia shook her head savagely namri had failed her shed been a fool to trust such a dangerous double instrument her aides whispered that stilgar was to blame that he was a secret rebel and what had become of halleck gone to ground among his smuggler friends possibly she picked up one of the report spools and muriz the man was hysterical that was the only possible explanation otherwise shed have to believe in miracles no human let alone a child even a child such as leto could leap from the butte at shuloch and survive to flee across the desert in leaps that took him from dunecrest to dunecrest alia felt the coldness of the shigawire under her hand where was leto then ghanima refused to believe him other than dead a truthsayer had confirmed her story leto slain by a laza tiger then who was the child reported by namri and muriz she shuddered forty qanats had been breached their waters loosed into the sand the loyal fremen and even the rebels superstitious louts all her reports were flooded with stories of mysterious occurrences sandtrout leaped into qanats and shattered to become hosts of small replicas worms deliberately drowned themselves blood dripped from second moon and fell to arrakis where it stirred up great storms and the storm frequency was increasing she thought of duncan incommunicado at tabr fretting under the restraints shed exacted from stilgar he and irulan talked of little else than the real meaning behind these omens fools even her spies betrayed the influence of these outrageous stories why did ghanima insist on her story of the laza tiger alia sighed only one of the reports on the shigawire spools reassured her faradn had sent a contingent of his household guard to help you in troubles and to prepare the way for the official rite of betrothal alia smiled to herself and shared the chuckle which rumbled in her skull that plan at least remained intact logical explanations would be found to dispel all of this other superstitious nonsense meanwhile shed use faradns men to help close down shuloch and to arrest the known dissidents especially among the naibs she debated moving against stilgar but the inner voice cautioned against this not yet my mother and the sisterhood still have some plan of their own alia whispered why is she training faradn perhaps he excites her the old baron said not that cold one youre not thinking of asking faradn to return her i know the dangers in that good meanwhile that young aide zia recently brought in i believe his names agarves buer agarves if youd invite him here tonight no alia its almost dawn you insatiable old fool theres a military council meeting this morning the priests will have dont trust them darling alia of course not very well now this buer agarves i said no the old baron remained silent within her but she began to feel a headache a slow pain crept upward from her left cheek into her skull once hed sent her raging down the corridors with this trick now she resolved to resist him if you persist ill take a sedative she said he could see she meant it the headache began to recede very well petulant another time then another time she agreed thou didst divide the sand by thy strength thou breakest the heads of the dragons in the desert yea i behold thee as a beast coming up from the dunes thou hast the two horns of the lamb but thou speakest as the dragon revised orange catholic bible arran it was the immutable prophecy the threads become rope a thing leto now seemed to have known all of his life he looked out across the evening shadows on the tanzerouft one hundred and seventy kilometers due north lay old gap the deep and twisting crevasse through the shield wall by which the first fremen had migrated into the desert no doubts remained in leto he knew why he stood here alone in the desert yet filled with a sense that he owned this entire land that it must do his bidding he felt the chord which connected him with all of humankind and that profound need for a universe of experiences which made logical sense a universe of recognizable regularities within its perpetual changes i know this universe the worm which had brought him here had come to the stamping of his foot and rising up in front of him had stopped like an obedient beast hed leaped atop it and with only his membraneamplified hands had exposed the leading lip of the worms rings to keep it on the surface the worm had exhausted itself in the nightlong dash northward its siliconsulfur internal factory had worked at capacity exhaling lavish gusts of oxygen which a following wind had sent in enveloping eddies around leto at times the warm gusts had made him dizzy filled his mind with strange perceptions the reflexive and circular subjectivity of his visions had turned inward upon his ancestry forcing him to relive portions of his terranic past then comparing those portions with his changing self already he could feel how far hed drifted from something recognizably human seduced by the spice which he gulped from every trace he found the membrane which covered him no longer was sandtrout just as he was no longer human cilia had crept into his flesh forming a new creature which would seek its own metamorphosis in the eons ahead you saw this father and rejected it he thought it was a thing too terrible to face leto knew what was believed of his father and why muaddib died of prescience but paul atreides had passed from the universe of reality into the alam almythal while still alive fleeing from this thing which his son had dared now there was only the preacher leto squatted on the sand and kept his attention northward the worm would come from that direction and on its back would ride two people a young fremen and a blind man a flight of pallid bats passed over letos head bending their course southeast they were random specks in the darkening sky and a knowledgeable fremen eye could mark their backcourse to learn where shelter lay that way the preacher would avoid that shelter though his destination was shuloch where no wild bats were permitted lest they guide strangers to a secret place the worm appeared first as a dark movement between the desert and the northern sky matar the rain of sand dropped from high altitudes by a dying stormwind obscured the view for a few minutes then it returned clearer and closer the coldline at the base of the dune where leto crouched began to produce its nightly moisture he tasted the fragile dampness in his nostrils adjusted the bubble cap of the membrane over his mouth there no longer was any need for him to find soaks and sipwells from his mothers genes he had that longer larger fremen large intestine to take back water from everything which came its way the living stillsuit grasped and retained every bit of moisture it encountered and even while he sat here the membrane which touched sand extruded pseudopodcilia to hunt for bits of energy which it could store leto studied the approaching worm he knew the youthful guide had seen him by this time noting the spot atop the dune the worm rider would discern no principle in this object seen from a distance but that was a problem fremen had learned how to handle any unknown object was dangerous the young guides reactions would be quite predictable even without the vision true to that prediction the worms course shifted slightly and aimed directly at leto giant worms were a weapon which fremen had employed many times worms had helped beat shaddam at arrakeen this worm however failed to do its riders bidding it came to a halt ten meters away and no manner of goading would send it across another grain of sand leto arose feeling the cilia snap back into the membrane behind him he freed his mouth and called out achlan wasachlan welcome twice welcome the blind man stood behind his guide atop the worm one hand on the youths shoulder the man held his face high nose pointed over letos head as though trying to sniff out this interruption sunset painted orange on his forehead who is that the blind man asked shaking his guides shoulder why have we stopped his voice was nasal through the stillsuit plugs the youth stared fearfully down at leto said it is only someone alone in the desert a child by his looks i tried to send the worm over him but the worm wont go why didnt you say the blind man demanded i thought it was only someone alone in the desert the youth protested but its a demon spoken like a true son of jacurutu leto said and you sire you are the preacher i am that one yes and there was fear in the preachers voice because at last he had met his own past this is no garden leto said but you are welcome to share this place with me tonight who are you the preacher demanded how have you stopped our worm there was an ominous tone of recognition in the preachers voice now he called up the memories of this alternate vision knowing he could reach an end here its a demon the young guide protested we must flee this place or our souls silence the preacher roared i am leto atreides leto said your worm stopped because i commanded it the preacher stood in frozen silence come father leto said alight and spend the night with me ill give you sweet syrup to sip i see youve fremkits with food and water jars well share our riches here upon the sand letos yet a child the preacher protested and they say hes dead of corrino treachery theres no childhood in your voice you know me sire leto said im small for my age as you were but my experience is ancient and my voice has learned what do you here in the inner desert the preacher asked bu ji leto said nothing from nothing it was the answer of a zensunni wanderer one who acted only from a position of rest without effort and in harmony with his surroundings the preacher shook his guides shoulder is it a child truly a child aiya the youth said keeping a fearful attention on leto a great shuddering sigh shook the preacher no he said it is a demon in child form the guide said you will spend the night here leto said we will do as he says the preacher said he released his grip on the guide slipped off the worms side and slid down a ring to the sand leaping clear when his feet touched turning he said take the worm off and send it back into the sand it is tired and will not bother us the worm will not go the youth protested it will go leto said but if you try to flee on it ill let it eat you he moved to one side out of the worms sensory range pointed in the direction they had come go that way the youth tapped a goad against the ring behind him wiggled a hook where it held a ring open slowly the worm began to slide over the sand turning as the youth shifted his hook down a side the preacher following the sound of letos voice clambered up the duneslope and stood two paces away it was done with a swift sureness which told leto this would be no easy contest here the visions parted leto said remove your suit mask father the preacher obeyed dropping the fold of his hood and withdrawing the mouth cover knowing his own appearance leto studied this face seeing the lines of likeness as though theyd been outlined in light the lines formed an indefinable reconciliation a pathway of genes without sharp boundaries and there was no mistaking them those lines came down to leto from the humming days from the waterdripping days from the miracle seas of caladan but now they stood at a dividing point on arrakis as night waited to fold itself into the dunes so father leto said glancing to the left where he could see the youthful guide trudging back to them from where the worm had been abandoned mu zein the preacher said waving his right hand in a cutting gesture this is no good koolish zein leto said voice soft this is all the good we may ever have and he added speaking in chakobsa the atreides battle language here i am here i remain we can not forget that father the preachers shoulders sagged he put both hands to his empty sockets in a longunused gesture i gave you the sight of my eyes once and took your memories leto said i know your decisions and ive been to that place where you hid yourself i know the preacher lowered his hands you will remain you named me for the man who put that on his coat of arms leto said jy suis jy reste the preacher sighed deeply how far has it gone this thing youve done to yourself my skin is not my own father the preacher shuddered then i know how you found me here yes i fastened my memory to a place my flesh had never known leto said i need an evening with my father im not your father im only a poor copy a relic he turned his head toward the sound of the approaching guide i no longer go to the visions for my future as he spoke darkness covered the desert stars leaped out above them and leto too turned toward the approaching guide wubakh ul kuhar leto called to the youth greetings back came the response subakh un nar speaking in a hoarse whisper the preacher said that young assan tariq is a dangerous one all of the cast out are dangerous leto said but not to me he spoke in a low conversational tone if thats your vision i will not share it the preacher said perhaps you have no choice leto said you are the fithaquiqa the reality you are abu dhur father of the indefinite roads of time im no more than bait in a trap the preacher said and his voice was bitter and alia already has eaten that bait leto said but i dont like its taste you can not do this the preacher hissed ive already done it my skin is not my own perhaps its not too late for you to it is too late leto bent his head to one side he could hear assan tariq trudging up the duneslope toward them coming to the sound of their voices greetings assan tariq of shuloch leto said the youth stopped just below leto on the slope a dark shadow there in the starlight there was indecision in the set of his shoulders the way he tipped his head yes leto said im the one who escaped from shuloch when i heard the preacher began and again you can not do this i am doing it what matter if youre made blind once more you think i fear that the preacher asked do you not see the fine guide they have provided for me i see him again leto faced tariq didnt you hear me assan im the one who escaped from shuloch youre a demon the youth quavered your demon leto said but you are my demon and leto felt the tension grow between himself and his father it was a shadow play all around them a projection of unconscious forms and leto felt the memories of his father a form of backward prophecy which sorted visions from the familiar reality of this moment tariq sensed it this battle of the visions he slid several paces backward down the slope you can not control the future the preacher whispered and the sound of his voice was filled with effort as though he lifted a great weight leto felt the dissonance between them then it was an element of the universe with which his entire life grappled either he or his father would be forced to act soon making a decision by that act choosing a vision and his father was right trying for some ultimate control of the universe you only built weapons with which the universe eventually defeated you to choose and manage a vision required you to balance on a single thin thread playing god on a high tightwire with cosmic solitude on both sides neither contestant could retreat into deathassurceasefromparadox each knew the visions and the rules all of the old illusions were dying and when one contestant moved the other might countermove the only real truth that mattered to them now was that which separated them from the vision background there was no place of safety only a transitory shifting of relationships marked out within the limits which they now imposed and bound for inevitable changes each of them had only a desperate and lonely courage upon which to rely but leto possessed two advantages he had committed himself upon a path from which there was no turning back and he had accepted the terrible consequences to himself his father still hoped there was a way back and had made no final commitment you must not you must not the preacher rasped he sees my advantage leto thought leto spoke in a conversational tone masking his own tensions the balancing effort this otherlevel contest required i have no passionate belief in truth no faith other than what i create he said and he felt then a movement between himself and his father something with granular characteristics which touched only letos own passionately subjective belief in himself by such belief he knew that he posted the markers of the golden path someday such markers could tell others how to be human a strange gift from a creature who no longer would be human on that day but these markers were always set in place by gamblers leto felt them scattered throughout the landscape of his inner lives and feeling this poised himself for the ultimate gamble softly he sniffed the air seeking the signal which both he and his father knew must come one question remained would his father warn the terrified young guide who waited below them presently leto sensed ozone in his nostrils the betraying odor of a shield true to his orders from the cast out young tariq was trying to kill both of these dangerous atreides not knowing the horrors which this would precipitate dont the preacher whispered but leto knew the signal was a true one he sensed ozone but there was no tingling in the air around them tariq used a pseudoshield in the desert a weapon developed exclusively for arrakis the holtzmann effect would summon a worm while it maddened that worm nothing would stop such a worm not water not the presence of sandtrout nothing yes the youth had planted the device in the duneslope and was beginning to edge away from the danger zone leto launched himself off the dunetop hearing his father scream in protest but the awful impetus of letos amplified muscles threw his body like a missile one outflung hand caught the neck of tariqs stillsuit the other slapped around to grip the doomed youths robe at the waist there came a single snap as the neck broke leto rolled lifting his body like a finely balanced instrument which dove directly into the sand where the pseudoshield had been hidden fingers found the thing and he had it out of the sand throwing it in a looping arc far out to the south of them presently there came a great hissingthrashing din out on the desert where the pseudoshield had gone it subsided and silence returned leto looked up to the top of the dune where his father stood still defiant but defeated that was paul muaddib up there blind angry near despair as a consequence of his flight from the vision which leto had accepted pauls mind would be reflecting now upon the zensunni long koan in the one act of predicting an accurate future muaddib introduced an element of development and growth into the very prescience through which he saw human existence by this he brought uncertainty onto himself seeking the absolute of orderly prediction he amplified disorder distorted prediction returning to the dunetop in a single leap leto said now im your guide never would you go back to shuloch even if theyd welcome you when you arrived without tariq where has shuloch gone now do your eyes see it paul confronted his son then aiming the eyeless sockets at leto do you really know the universe you have created here leto heard the particular emphasis the vision which both of them knew had been set into terrible motion here had required an act of creation at a certain point in time for that moment the entire sentient universe shared a linear view of time which possessed characteristics of orderly progression they entered this time as they might step onto a moving vehicle and they could only leave it the same way against this leto held the multithread reins balanced in his own visionlighted view of time as multilinear and multilooped he was the sighted man in the universe of the blind only he could scatter the orderly rationale because his father no longer held the reins in letos view a son had altered the past and a thought as yet undreamed in the farthest future could reflect upon the now and move his hand only his hand paul knew this because he no longer could see how leto might manipulate the reins could only recognize the inhuman consequences which leto had accepted and he thought here is the change for which i prayed why do i fear it because its the golden path im here to give purpose to evolution and therefore to give purpose to our lives leto said do you wish to live those thousands of years changing as you now know you will change leto recognized that his father was not speaking about physical changes both of them knew the physical consequences leto would adapt and adapt the skinwhichwasnothisown would adapt and adapt the evolutionary thrust of each part would melt into the other and a single transformation would emerge when metamorphosis came if it came a thinking creature of awesome dimensions would emerge upon the universe and that universe would worship him no paul was referring to the inner changes the thoughts and decisions which would inflict themselves upon the worshipers those who think you dead leto said you know what they say about your last words of course now i do what all life must do in the service of life leto said you never said that but a priest who thought you could never return and call him liar put those words into your mouth id not call him liar paul took in a deep breath those are good last words would you stay here or return to that hut in the basin of shuloch leto asked this is your universe now paul said the words filled with defeat cut through leto paul had tried to guide the last strands of a personal vision a choice hed made years before in sietch tabr for that hed accepted his role as an instrument of revenge for the cast out the remnants of jacurutu they had contaminated him but hed accepted this rather than his view of this universe which leto had chosen the sadness in leto was so great he could not speak for several minutes when he could manage his voice leto said so you baited alia tempted her and confused her into inaction and the wrong decisions and now she knows who you are she knows yes she knows pauls voice was old then and filled with hidden protests there was a reserve of defiance in him though he said ill take the vision away from you if i can thousands of peaceful years leto said thats what ill give them dormancy stagnation of course and those forms of violence which i permit itll be a lesson which humankind will never forget i spit on your lesson paul said you think ive not seen a thing similar to what you choose you saw it leto agreed is your vision any better than mine not one whit better worse perhaps leto said then what can i do but resist you paul demanded kill me perhaps im not that innocent i know what youve set in motion i know about the broken qanats and the unrest and now assan tariq will never return to shuloch you must go back with me or not at all because this is my vision now i choose not to go back how old his voice sounds leto thought and the thought was a wrenching pain he said ive the hawk ring of the atreides concealed in my dishdasha do you wish me to return it to you if id only died paul whispered i truly wanted to die when i went into the desert that night but i knew i could not leave this world i had to come back and restore the legend leto said i know and the jackals of jacurutu were waiting for you that night as you knew they would be they wanted your visions you knew that i refused i never gave them one vision but they contaminated you they fed you spice essence and plied you with women and dreams and you did have visions sometimes how sly his voice sounded will you take back your hawk ring leto asked paul sat down suddenly on the sand a dark blotch in the starlight no so he knows the futility of that path leto thought this revealed much but not enough the contest of the visions had moved from its delicate plane of choices down to a gross discarding of alternates paul knew he could not win but he hoped yet to nullify that single vision to which leto clung presently paul said yes i was contaminated by the jacurutu but you contaminate yourself thats true leto admitted i am your son and are you a good fremen yes will you permit a blind man to go into the desert finally will you let me find peace on my own terms he pounded the sand beside him no ill not permit that leto said but its your right to fall upon your knife if you insist upon it and you would have my body true no and so he knows that path leto thought the enshrining of muaddibs body by his son could be contrived as a form of cement for letos vision you never told them did you father leto asked i never told them but i told them leto said i told muriz kralizec the typhoon struggle pauls shoulders sagged you can not he whispered you can not i am a creature of this desert now father leto said would you speak thus to a coriolis storm you think me coward for refusing that path paul said his voice husky and trembling oh i understand you well son augury and haruspication have always been their own torments but i was never lost in the possible futures because this one is unspeakable your jihad will be a summer picnic on caladan by comparison leto agreed ill take you to gurney halleck now gurney he serves the sisterhood through my mother and now leto understood the extent of his fathers vision no father gurney no longer serves anyone i know the place to find him and i can take you there its time for the new legend to be created i see that i can not sway you let me touch you then for you are my son leto held out his right hand to meet the groping fingers felt their strength matched it and resisted every shift of pauls arm not even a poisoned knife will harm me now leto said im already a different chemistry tears slipped from the sightless eyes and paul released his grip dropped his hand to his side if id chosen your way id have become the bicouros of shaitan what will you become for a time theyll call me the missionary of shaitan too leto said then theyll begin to wonder and finally theyll understand you didnt take your vision far enough father your hands did good things and evil but the evil was known after the event which is the way of many great evils leto said you crossed over only into a part of my vision was your strength not enough you know i couldnt stay there i could never do an evil act which was known before the act im not jacurutu he clambered to his feet do you think me one of those who laughs alone at night it is sad that you were never really fremen leto said we fremen know how to commission the arifa our judges can choose between evils its always been that way for us fremen is it slaves of the fate you helped to make paul stepped toward leto reached out in an oddly shy movement touched letos sheathed arm explored up it to where the membrane exposed an ear then the cheek and finally the mouth ahhhh that is your own flesh yet he said where will that flesh take you he dropped his hand into a place where humans may create their futures from instant to instant so you say an abomination might say the same im not abomination though i mightve been leto said i saw how it goes with alia a demon lives in her father ghani and i know that demon its the baron your grandfather paul buried his face in his hands his shoulders shook for a moment then he lowered his hands and his mouth was set in a harsh line there is a curse upon our house i prayed that you would throw that ring into the sand that youd deny me and run away to make another life it was there for you at what price after a long silence paul said the end adjusts the path behind it just once i failed to fight for my principles just once i accepted the mahdinate i did it for chani but it made me a bad leader leto found he couldnt answer this the memory of that decision was there within him i can not lie to you any more than i could lie to myself paul said i know this every man should have such an auditor i will only ask this one thing is the typhoon struggle necessary its that or humans will be extinguished paul heard the truth in letos words spoke in a low voice which acknowledged the greater breadth of his sons vision i did not see that among the choices i believe the sisterhood suspects it leto said i can not accept any other explanation of my grandmothers decision the night wind blew coldly around them then it whipped pauls robe around his legs he trembled seeing this leto said youve a kit father ill inflate the tent and we can spend this night in comfort but paul could only shake his head knowing he would have no comfort from this night or any other muaddib the hero must be destroyed hed said it himself only the preacher could go on now fremen were the first humans to develop a consciousunconscious symbology through which to experience the movements and relationships of their planetary system they were the first people anywhere to express climate in terms of a semimathematic language whose written symbols embody and internalize the external relationships the language itself was part of the system it described its written form carried the shape of what it described the intimate local knowledge of what was available to support life was implicit in this development one can measure the extent of this languagesystem interaction by the fact that fremen accepted themselves as foraging and browsing animals the story of lietkynes by harq alada kaveh wahid stilgar said bring coffee he signaled with a raised hand to an aide who stood at one side near the single door to the austere rockwalled room where he had spent this wakeful night this was the place where the old fremen naib usually took his spartan breakfast and it was almost breakfast time but after such a night he did not feel hungry he stood stretching his muscles duncan idaho sat on a low cushion near the door trying to suppress a yawn he had just realized that while they talked he and stilgar had gone through an entire night forgive me stil he said ive kept you up all night to stay awake all night adds a day to your life stilgar said accepting the tray with coffee as it was passed in the door he pushed a low bench in front of idaho placed the tray on it and sat across from his guest both men wore the yellow robes of mourning but idahos was a borrowed garment worn because the people of tabr had resented the atreides green of his working uniform stilgar poured the dark brew from the fat copper carafe sipped first and lifted his cup as a signal to idaho the ancient fremen custom it is safe i have taken some of it the coffee was harahs work done just as stilgar preferred it the beans roasted to a rosebrown ground to a fine powder in a stone mortar while still hot and boiled immediately a pinch of melange added idaho inhaled the spicerich aroma sipped carefully but noisily he still did not know if he had convinced stilgar his mentat faculties had begun to work sluggishly in the early hours of the morning all of his computations confronted at last by the inescapable datum supplied in the message from gurney halleck alia had known about leto shed known and javid had to be a part of that knowing i must be freed of your restraints idaho said at last taking up the arguments once more stilgar stood his ground the agreement of neutrality requires me to make hard judgments ghani is safe here you and irulan are safe here but you may not send messages receive messages yes but you may not send them ive given my word this is not the treatment usually accorded a guest and an old friend who has shared your dangers idaho said knowing hed used this argument before stilgar put down his cup setting it carefully into its place on the tray and keeping his attention on it as he spoke we fremen dont feel guilt for the same things that arouse such feelings in others he said he raised his attention to idahos face he must be made to take ghani and flee this place idaho thought he said it was not my intention to raise a storm of guilt i understand that stilgar said i raise the question to impress upon you our fremen attitude because that is what we are dealing with fremen even alia thinks fremen and the priests they are another matter stilgar said they want the people to swallow the grey wind of sin taking that into the everlasting this is a great blotch by which they seek to know their own piety he spoke in a level voice but idaho heard the bitterness and wondered why that bitterness could not sway stilgar its an old old trick of autocratic rule idaho said alia knows it well good subjects must feel guilty the guilt begins as a feeling of failure the good autocrat provides many opportunities for failure in the populace ive noticed stilgar spoke dryly but you must forgive me if i mention to you once more that this is your wife of whom you speak it is the sister of muaddib shes possessed i tell you many say it she will have to undergo the test one day meanwhile there are other considerations more important idaho shook his head sadly everything ive told you can be verified the communication with jacurutu was always through alias temple the plot against the twins had accomplices there money for the sale of worms offplanet goes there all of the strings lead to alias office to the regency stilgar shook his head drew in a deep breath this is neutral territory ive given my word things cant go on this way idaho protested i agree stilgar nodded alias caught inside the circle and every day the circle grows smaller its like our old custom of having many wives this pinpoints male sterility he bent a questioning gaze on idaho you say she deceived you with other men using her sex as a weapon is the way i believe youve expressed it then you have a perfectly legal avenue available to you javids here in tabr with messages from alia you have only to on your neutral territory no but outside in the desert and if i took that opportunity to escape youll not be given such an opportunity still i swear to you alias possessed what do i have to do to convince you of a difficult thing to prove stilgar said it was the argument hed used many times during the night idaho recalled jessicas words said but youve ways of proving it a way yes stilgar said again he shook his head painful irrevocable that is why i remind you about our attitude toward guilt we can free ourselves from guilts which might destroy us in everything except the trial of possession for that the tribunal which is all of the people accepts complete responsibility youve done it before havent you im sure the reverend mother didnt omit our history in her recital stilgar said you well know weve done it before idaho responded to the irritation in stilgars voice i wasnt trying to trap you in a falsehood its just its the long night and the questions without answers stilgar said and now its morning i must be allowed to send a message to jessica idaho said that would be a message to salusa stilgar said i dont make evening promises my word is meant to be kept that is why tabrs neutral territory i will hold you in silence i have pledged this for my entire household alia must be brought to your trial perhaps first we must find out if there are extenuating circumstances a failure of authority possibly or even bad luck it could be a case of that natural bad tendency which all humans share and not possession at all you want to be sure im not just the husband wronged seeking others to execute his revenge idaho said the thought has occurred to others not to me stilgar said he smiled to take the sting out of his words we fremen have our science of tradition our hadith when we fear a mentat or a reverend mother we revert to the hadith it is said that the only fear we can not correct is the fear of our own mistakes the lady jessica must be told idaho said gurney says that message may not come from gurney halleck it comes from no other we atreides have our ways of verifying messages stil wont you at least explore some of jacurutu is no more stilgar said it was destroyed many generations ago he touched idahos sleeve in any event i can not spare the fighting men these are troubled times the threat to the qanat you understand he sat back now when alia there is no more alia idaho said so you say stilgar took another sip of coffee replaced the cup let it rest there friend idaho often theres no need to tear off an arm to remove a splinter then lets talk about ghanima theres no need she has my countenance my bond no one can harm her here he can not be that naive idaho thought but stilgar was rising to indicate that the interview was ended idaho levered himself to his feet feeling the stiffness in his knees his calves felt numb as idaho stood an aide entered and stood aside javid came into the room behind him idaho turned stilgar stood four paces away without hesitating idaho drew his knife in one swift motion and drove its point into the breast of the unsuspecting javid the man staggered backward pulling himself off the knife he turned fell onto his face his legs kicked and he was dead that was to silence the gossip idaho said the aide stood with drawn knife undecided how to react idaho had already sheathed his own knife leaving a trace of blood on the edge of his yellow robe you have defiled my honor stilgar cried this is neutral shut up idaho glared at the shocked naib you wear a collar stilgar it was one of the three most deadly insults which could be directed at a fremen stilgars face went pale you are a servant idaho said youve sold fremen for their water this was the second most deadly insult the one which had destroyed the original jacurutu stilgar ground his teeth put a hand on his crysknife the aide stepped back away from the body in the doorway turning his back on the naib idaho stepped into the door taking the narrow opening beside javids body and speaking without turning delivered the third insult you have no immortality stilgar none of your descendants carry your blood where do you go now mentat stilgar called as idaho continued leaving the room stilgars voice was as cold as a wind from the poles to find jacurutu idaho said still not turning stilgar drew his knife perhaps i can help you idaho was at the outer lip of the passage now without stopping he said if youd help me with your knife waterthief please do it in my back thats the fitting way for one who wears the collar of a demon with two leaping strides stilgar crossed the room stepped on javids body and caught idaho in the outer passage one gnarled hand jerked idaho around and to a stop stilgar confronted idaho with bared teeth and a drawn knife such was his rage that stilgar did not even see the curious smile on idahos face draw your knife mentat scum stilgar roared idaho laughed he cuffed stilgar sharply left hand right hand two stinging slaps to the head with an incoherent screech stilgar drove his knife into idahos abdomen striking upward through the diaphragm into the heart idaho sagged onto the blade grinned up at stilgar whose rage dissolved into sudden icy shock two deaths for the atreides idaho husked the second for no better reason than the first he lurched sideways collapsed to the stone floor on his face blood spread out from his wound stilgar stared down past his dripping knife at the body of idaho took a deep trembling breath javid lay dead behind him and the consort of alia the womb of heaven lay dead at stilgars own hands it might be argued that a naib had but protected the honor of his name avenging the threat to his promised neutrality but this dead man was duncan idaho no matter the arguments available no matter the extenuating circumstances nothing could erase such an act even were alia to approve privately she would be forced to respond publicly in revenge she was after all fremen to rule fremen she could be nothing else not even to the smallest degree only then did it occur to stilgar that this situation was precisely what idaho had intended to buy with his second death stilgar looked up saw the shocked face of harah his second wife peering at him in an enclosing throng everywhere stilgar turned there were faces with identical expressions shock and an understanding of the consequences slowly stilgar drew himself erect wiped the blade on his sleeve and sheathed it speaking to the faces his tone casual he said those wholl go with me should pack at once send men to summon worms where will you go stilgar harah asked into the desert i will go with you she said of course youll go with me all of my wives will go with me and ghanima get her harah at once yes stilgar at once she hesitated and irulan if she wishes yes husband still she hesitated you take ghani as hostage hostage he was genuinely startled by the thought woman he touched idahos body softly with a toe if this mentat was right im ghanis only hope and he remembered then letos warning beware of alia you must take ghani and flee after the fremen all planetologists see life as expressions of energy and look for the overriding relationships in small pieces bits and parcels which grow into general understanding the fremen racial wisdom is translated into a new certainty the thing fremen have as a people any people can have they need but develop a sense for energy relationships they need but observe that energy soaks up the patterns of things and builds with those patterns the arrakeen catastrophe after harq alada it was tueks sietch on the inner lip of false wall halleck stood in the shadow of the rock buttress which shielded the high entrance to the sietch waiting for those inside to decide whether they would shelter him he turned his gaze outward to the northern desert and then upward to the greyblue morning sky the smugglers here had been astonished to learn that he an offworlder had captured a worm and ridden it but halleck had been equally astonished at their reaction the thing was simple for an agile man whod seen it done many times halleck returned his attention to the desert the silver desert of shining rocks and greygreen fields where water had worked its magic all of this struck him suddenly as an enormously fragile containment of energy of life everything threatened by an abrupt shift in the pattern of change he knew the source of this reaction it was the bustling scene on the desert floor below him containers of dead sandtrout were being trundled into the sietch for distillation and recovery of their water there were thousands of the creatures they had come to an outpouring of water and it was this outpouring which had set hallecks mind racing halleck stared downward across the sietch fields and the qanat boundary which no longer flowed with precious water he had seen the holes in the qanats stone walls the rending of the rock liner which had spilled water into the sand what had made those holes some stretched along twenty meters of the qanats most vulnerable sections in places where soft sand led outward into waterabsorbing depressions it was those depressions which had swarmed with sandtrout the children of the sietch were killing them and capturing them repair teams worked on the shattered walls of the qanat others carried minims of irrigation water to the most needy plants the water source in the gigantic cistern beneath tueks windtrap had been closed off preventing the flow into the shattered qanat the sunpowered pumps had been disconnected the irrigation water came from dwindling pools at the bottom of the qanat and laboriously from the cistern within the sietch the metal frame of the doorseal behind halleck crackled in the growing warmth of the day as though the sound moved his eyes halleck found his gaze drawn to the farthest curve of the qanat to the place where water had reached most impudently into the desert the gardenhopeful planners of the sietch had planted a special tree there and it was doomed unless the water flow could be restored soon halleck stared at the silly trailing plumage of a willow tree there shredded by sand and wind for him that tree symbolized the new reality for himself and for arrakis both of us are alien here they were taking a long time over their decision within the sietch but they could use good fighting men smugglers always needed good men halleck had no illusions about them though the smugglers of this age were not the smugglers whod sheltered him so many years ago when hed fled the dissolution of his dukes fief no these were a new breed quick to seek profit again he focused on the silly willow it came to halleck then that the stormwinds of his new reality might shred these smugglers and all of their friends it might destroy stilgar with his fragile neutrality and take with him all of the tribes who remained loyal to alia theyd all become colonial peoples halleck had seen it happen before knowing the bitter taste of it on his own homeworld he saw it clearly recalling the mannerisms of the city fremen the pattern of the suburbs and the unmistakable ways of the rural sietch which rubbed off even on this smugglers hideaway the rural districts were colonies of the urban centers theyd learned how to wear a padded yoke led into it by their greed if not their superstitions even here especially here the people had the attitude of a subject population not the attitude of free men they were defensive concealing evasive any manifestation of authority was subject to resentment any authority the regencys stilgars their own council i cant trust them halleck thought he could only use them and nurture their distrust of others it was sad gone was the old give and take of free men the old ways had been reduced to ritual words their origins lost to memory alia had done her work well punishing opposition and rewarding assistance shifting the imperial forces in random fashion concealing the major elements of her imperial power the spies gods below the spies she must have halleck could almost see the deadly rhythm of movement and countermovement by which alia hoped to keep her opposition off balance if the fremen remain dormant shell win he thought the doorseal behind him crackled as it was opened a sietch attendant named melides emerged he was a short man with a gourdlike body which dwindled into spindly legs whose ugliness was only accented by a stillsuit you have been accepted melides said and halleck heard the sly dissimulation in the mans voice what that voice revealed told halleck there was sanctuary here for only a limited time just until i can steal one of their thopters he thought my gratitude to your council he said and he thought of esmar tuek for whom this sietch had been named esmar long dead of someones treachery would have slit the throat of this melides on sight any path which narrows future possibilities may become a lethal trap humans are not threading their way through a maze they scan a vast horizon filled with unique opportunities the narrowing viewpoint of the maze should appeal only to creatures with their noses buried in sand sexually produced uniqueness and differences are the lifeprotection of the spices the spacing guild handbook why do i not feel grief alia directed the question at the ceiling of her small audience chamber a room she could cross in ten paces one way and fifteen the other it had two tall and narrow windows which looked out across the arrakeen rooftops at the shield wall it was almost noon the sun burned down into the pan upon which the city had been built alia lowered her gaze to buer agarves the former tabrite and now aide to zia who directed the temple guards agarves had brought the news that javid and idaho were dead a mob of sycophants aides and guards had come in with him and more crowded the areaway outside revealing that they already knew agarvess message bad news traveled fast on arrakis he was a small man this agarves with a round face for a fremen almost infantile in its roundness he was one of the new breed who had gone to waterfatness alia saw him as though he had been split into two images one with a serious face and opaque indigo eyes a worried expression around the mouth the other image sensuous and vulnerable excitingly vulnerable she especially liked the thickness of his lips although it was not yet noon alia felt something in the shocked silence around her that spoke of sunset idaho shouldve died at sunset she told herself how is it buer that youre the bearer of this news she asked noting the watchful quickness which came into his expression agarves tried to swallow spoke in a hoarse voice hardly more than a whisper i went with javid you recall and when stilgar sent me to you he said for me to tell you that i carried his final obedience final obedience she echoed whatd he mean by that i dont know lady alia he pleaded explain to me again what you saw she ordered and she wondered at how cold her skin felt i saw he bobbed his head nervously looked at the floor in front of alia i saw the holy consort dead upon the floor of the central passage and javid lay dead nearby in a side passage the women already were preparing them for huanui and stilgar summoned you to this scene that is true my lady stilgar summoned me he sent modibo the bent one his messenger in sietch modibo gave me no warning he merely told me stilgar wanted me and you saw my husbands body there on the floor he met her eyes with a darting glance returned his attention once more to the floor in front of her before nodding yes my lady and javid dead nearby stilgar told me told me that the holy consort had slain javid and my husband you say stilgar he said it to me with his own mouth my lady stilgar said he had done this he said the holy consort provoked him to rage rage alia repeated how was that done he didnt say no one said i asked and no one said and thats when you were sent to me with this news yes my lady was there nothing you could do agarves wet his lips with his tongue then stilgar commanded my lady it was his sietch i see and you always obeyed stilgar i always did my lady until he freed me from my bond when you were sent to my service you mean i obey only you now my lady is that right tell me buer if i commanded you to slay stilgar your old naib would you do it he met her gaze with a growing firmness if you commanded it my lady i do command it have you any idea where hes gone into the desert thats all i know my lady how many men did he take perhaps half the effectives and ghanima and irulan with him yes my lady those who left are burdened with their women their children and their baggage stilgar gave everyone a choice go with him or be freed of their bond many chose to be freed they will select a new naib ill select their new naib and itll be you buer agarves on the day you bring me stilgars head agarves could accept selection by battle it was a fremen way he said as you command my lady what forces may i see zia i cant give you many thopters for the search theyre needed elsewhere but youll have enough fighting men stilgar has defamed his honor many will serve with you gladly ill get about it then my lady wait she studied him a moment reviewing whom she could send to watch over this vulnerable infant he would need close watching until hed proved himself zia would know whom to send am i not dismissed my lady you are not dismissed i must consult you privately and at length on your plans to take stilgar she put a hand to her face ill not grieve until youve exacted my revenge give me a few minutes to compose myself she lowered her hand one of my attendants will show you the way she gave a subtle hand signal to one of her attendants whispered to shalus her new dame of chamber have him washed and perfumed before you bring him he smells of worm yes mistress alia turned then feigning the grief she did not feel and fled to her private chambers there in her bedroom she slammed the door into its tracks cursed and stamped her foot damn that duncan why why why she sensed a deliberate provocation from idaho hed slain javid and provoked stilgar it said he knew about javid the whole thing must be taken as a message from duncan idaho a final gesture again she stamped her foot and again raging across the bedchamber damn him damn him damn him stilgar gone over to the rebels and ghanima with him irulan too damn them all her stamping foot encountered a painful obstacle descending onto metal pain brought a cry from her and she peered down finding that shed bruised her foot on a metal buckle she snatched it up stood frozen at the sight of it in her hand it was an old buckle one of the silverandplatinum originals from caladan awarded originally by the duke leto atreides i to his swordmaster duncan idaho shed seen duncan wear it many times and hed discarded it here alias fingers clutched convulsively on the buckle idaho had left it here when when tears sprang from her eyes forced out against the great fremen conditioning her mouth drew down into a frozen grimace and she sensed the old battle begin within her skull reaching out to her fingertips to her toes she felt that she had become two people one looked upon these fleshly contortions with astonishment the other sought submission to an enormous pain spreading in her chest the tears flowed freely from her eyes now and the astonished one within her demanded querulously who cries who is it that cries who is crying now but nothing stopped the tears and she felt the painfulness which flamed through her breast as it moved her flesh and hurled her onto the bed still something demanded out of that profound astonishment who cries who is that by these acts leto ii removed himself from the evolutionary succession he did it with a deliberate cutting action saying to be independent is to be removed both twins saw beyond the needs of memory as a measuring process that is a way of determining their distance from their human origins but it was left to leto ii to do the audacious thing recognizing that a real creation is independent of its creator he refused to reenact the evolutionary sequence saying that too takes me farther and farther from humanity he saw the implications in this that there can be no truly closed systems in life the holy metamorphosis by harq alada there were birds thriving on the insect life which teemed in the damp sand beyond the broken qanat parrots magpies jays this had been a djedida the last of the new towns built on a foundation of exposed basalt it was abandoned now ghanima using the morning hours to study the area beyond the original plantings of the abandoned sietch detected movement and saw a banded gecko lizard thered been a gila woodpecker earlier nesting in a mud wall of the djedida she thought of it as a sietch but it was really a collection of low walls made of stabilized mud brick surrounded by plantings to hold back the dunes it lay within the tanzerouft six hundred kilometers south of sihaya ridge without human hands to maintain it the sietch already was beginning to melt back into the desert its walls eroded by sandblast winds its plants dying its plantation area cracked by the burning sun yet the sand beyond the shattered qanat remained damp attesting to the fact that the squat bulk of the windtrap still functioned in the months since their flight from tabr the fugitives had sampled the protection of several such places made uninhabitable by the desert demon ghanima didnt believe in the desert demon although there was no denying the visible evidence of the qanats destruction occasionally they had word from the northern settlements through encounters with rebel spicehunters a few thopters some said no more than six carried out search flights seeking stilgar but arrakis was large and its desert was friendly to the fugitives reportedly there was a searchanddestroy force charged with finding stilgars band but the force which was led by the former tabrite buer agarves had other duties and often returned to arrakeen the rebels said there was little fighting between their men and the troops of alia random depredations of the desert demon made home guard duty the first concern of alia and the naibs even the smugglers had been hit but they were said to be scouring the desert for stilgar wanting the price on his head stilgar had brought his band into the djedida just before dark the previous day following the unerring moisture sense of his old fremen nose hed promised they would head south for the palmyries soon but refused to put a date on the move although he carried a price on his head which once would have bought a planet stilgar seemed the happiest and most carefree of men this is a good place for us hed said pointing out that the windtrap still functioned our friends have left us some water they were a small band now sixty people in all the old the sick and the very young had been filtered south into the palmyries absorbed there by trusted families only the toughest remained and they had many friends to the north and the south ghanima wondered why stilgar refused to discuss what was happening to the planet couldnt he see it as qanats were shattered fremen pulled back to the northern and southern lines which once had marked the extent of their holdings this movement could only signal what must be happening to the empire one condition was the mirror of the other ghanima ran a hand under the collar of her stillsuit and resealed it despite her worries she felt remarkably free here the inner lives no longer plagued her although she sometimes felt their memories inserted into her consciousness she knew from those memories what this desert had been once before the work of the ecological transformation it had been drier for one thing that unrepaired windtrap still functioned because it processed moist air many creatures which once had shunned this desert ventured to live here now many in the band remarked how the daylight owls proliferated even now ghanima could see antbirds they jigged and danced alone the insect lines which swarmed in the damp sand at the end of the shattered qanat few badgers were to be seen out here but there were kangaroo mice in uncounted numbers superstitious fear ruled the new fremen and stilgar was no better than the rest this djedida had been given back to the desert after its qanat had been shattered a fifth time in eleven months four times theyd repaired the ravages of the desert demon then theyd no longer had the surplus water to risk another loss it was the same all through the djedidas and in many of the old sietches eight out of nine new settlements had been abandoned many of the old sietch communities were more crowded than they had ever been before and while the desert entered this new phase fremen reverted to their old ways they saw omens in everything were worms increasingly scarce except in the tanzerouft it was the judgment of shaihulud and dead worms had been seen with nothing to say why they died they went back to desert dust swiftly after death but those crumbling hulks which fremen chanced upon filled the observers with terror stilgars band had encountered such a hulk the previous month and it had taken four days for them to shake off the feeling of evil the thing had reeked of sour and poisonous putrefaction its moldering hulk had been found sitting on top of a giant spiceblow the spice mostly ruined ghanima turned from observing the qanat and looked back at the djedida directly in front of her lay a broken wall which once had protected a mushtamal a small garden annex shed explored the place with a firm dependence upon her own curiosity and had found a store of flat unleavened spicebread in a stone box stilgar had destroyed it saying fremen would never leave good food behind them ghanima had suspected he was mistaken but it hadnt been worth the argument or the risk fremen were changing once theyd moved freely across the bled drawn by natural needs water spice trade animal activities had been their alarm clocks but animals moved to strange new rhythms now while most fremen huddled close in their old cavewarrens within the shadow of the northern shield wall spicehunters in the tanzerouft were rare and only stilgars band moved in the old ways she trusted stilgar and his fear of alia irulan reinforced his arguments now reverting to odd bene gesserit musings but on faraway salusa faradn still lived someday there would have to be a reckoning ghanima looked up at the greysilver morning sky questing in her mind where was help to be found where was there someone to listen when she revealed what she saw happening all around them the lady jessica stayed on salusa if the reports were to be believed and alia was a creature on a pedestal involved only in being colossal while she drifted farther and farther from reality gurney halleck was nowhere to be found although he was reported seen everywhere the preacher had gone into hiding his heretical rantings only a fading memory and stilgar she looked across the broken wall to where stilgar was helping repair the cistern stilgar reveled in his role as the willothedesert the price upon his head growing monthly nothing made sense anymore nothing who was this desert demon this creature able to destroy qanats as though they were false idols to be toppled into the sand was it a rogue worm was it a third force in rebellion many people no one believed it was a worm the water would kill any worm venturing against a qanat many fremen believed the desert demon was actually a revolutionary band bent on overthrowing alias mahdinate and restoring arrakis to its old ways those who believed this said it would be a good thing get rid of that greedy apostolic succession which did little else than uphold its own mediocrity get back to the true religion which muaddib had espoused a deep sigh shook ghanima oh leto she thought im almost glad you didnt live to see these days id join you myself but ive a knife yet unblooded alia and faradn faradn and alia the old barons her demon and that cant be permitted harah came out of the djedida approaching ghanima with a steady sandswallowing pace harah stopped in front of ghanima demanded what do you alone out here this is a strange place harah we should leave stilgar waits to meet someone here oh he didnt tell me that why should he tell you everything maku harah slapped the water pouch which bulged the front of ghanimas robe are you a grown woman to be pregnant ive been pregnant so many times theres no counting them ghanima said dont play those adultchild games with me harah took a backward step at the venom in ghanimas voice youre a band of stupids ghanima said waving her hand to encompass the djedida and the activities of stilgar and his people i should never have come with you youd be dead by now if you hadnt perhaps but you dont see whats right in front of your faces who is it that stilgar waits to meet here buer agarves ghanima stared at her he is being brought here secretly by friends from red chasm sietch harah explained alias little plaything he is being brought under blindfold does stilgar believe that buer asked for the parley he agreed to all of our terms why wasnt i told about this stilgar knew you would argue against it argue against this is madness harah scowled dont forget that buer is hes family ghanima snapped hes the grandson of stilgars cousin i know and the faradn whose blood ill draw one day is as close a relative to me do you think thatll stay my knife weve had a distrans no one follows his party ghanima spoke in a low voice nothing good will come of this harah we should leave at once have you read an omen harah asked that dead worm we saw was that stuff that into your womb and give birth to it elsewhere ghanima raged i dont like this meeting nor this place isnt that enough ill tell stilgar what you ill tell him myself ghanima strode past harah who made the sign of the worm horns at her back to ward off evil but stilgar only laughed at ghanimas fears and ordered her to look for sandtrout as though she were one of the children she fled into one of the djedidas abandoned houses and crouched in a corner to nurse her anger the emotion passed quickly though she felt the stirring of the inner lives and remembered someone saying if we can immobilize them things will go as we plan what an odd thought but she couldnt recall whod said those words muaddib was disinherited and he spoke for the disinherited of all time he cried out against that profound injustice which alienates the individual from that which he was taught to believe from that which seemed to come to him as a right the mahdinate an analysis by harq alada gurney halleck sat on the butte at shuloch with his baliset beside him on a spicefiber rug below him the enclosed basin swarmed with workers planting crops the sand ramp up which the cast out had lured worms on a spice trail had been blocked off with a new qanat plantings moved down the slope to hold it it was almost time for the noon meal and halleck had been on the butte for more than an hour seeking privacy in which to think humans did the labor below him but everything he saw was the work of melange letos personal estimate was that spice production would fall soon to a stabilized onetenth of its peak in the harkonnen years stockpiles throughout the empire doubled in value at every new posting three hundred and twentyone liters were said to have bought half of novebruns planet from the metulli family the cast out worked like men driven by a devil and perhaps they were before every meal they faced the tanzerouft and prayed to shaihulud personified that was how they saw leto and through their eyes halleck saw a future where most of humankind shared that view halleck wasnt sure he liked the prospect leto had set the pattern when hed brought halleck and the preacher here in hallecks stolen thopter with his bare hands leto had breached the shuloch qanat hurling large stones more than fifty meters when the cast out had tried to intervene leto had decapitated the first to reach him using no more than a blurred sweep of his arm hed hurled others back into their companions and had laughed at their weapons in a demonvoice hed roared at them fire will not touch me your knives will not harm me i wear the skin of shaihulud the cast out had recognized him then and recalled his escape leaping from the butte directly to the desert theyd prostrated themselves before him and leto had issued his orders i bring you two guests you will guard them and honor them you will rebuild your qanat and begin planting an oasis garden one day ill make my home here you will prepare my home you will sell no more spice but you will store every bit you collect on and on hed gone with his instructions and the cast out had heard every word seeing him through fearglazed eyes through a terrifying awe here was shaihulud come up from the sand at last thered been no intimation of this metamorphosis when leto had found halleck with ghadhean alfali in one of the small rebel sietches at gare ruden with his blind companion leto had come up from the desert along the old spice route traveling by worm through an area where worms were now a rarity hed spoken of several detours forced upon him by the presence of moisture in the sand enough water to poison a worm theyd arrived shortly after noon and had been brought into the stonewalled common room by guards the memory haunted halleck now so this is the preacher hed said striding around the blind man studying him halleck recalled the stories about him no stillsuit mask hid the old face in sietch and the features were there for memory to make its comparisons yes the man did look like the old duke for whom leto had been named was it a chance likeness you know the stories about this one halleck asked speaking in an aside to leto that hes your father come back from the desert ive heard the stories halleck turned to examine the boy leto wore an odd stillsuit with rolled edges around his face and ears a black robe covered it and sandboots sheathed his feet there was much to be explained about his presence here how hed managed to escape once more why do you bring the preacher here halleck asked in jacurutu they said he works for them no more i bring him because alia wants him dead so you think this is a sanctuary you are his sanctuary all this time the preacher stood near them listening but giving no sign that he cared which turn their discussion took he has served me well gurney leto said house atreides has not lost all sense of obligation to those who serve us house atreides i am house atreides you fled jacurutu before i could complete the testing which your grandmother ordered halleck said his voice cold how can you assume this mans life is to be guarded as though it were your own leto spoke as though there were no argument and he met hallecks stare without flinching jessica had trained halleck in many of the bene gesserit refinements of observation and hed detected nothing in leto which spoke of other than calm assurance jessicas orders remained though your grandmother charged me to complete your education and be sure youre not possessed im not possessed just a flat statement why did you run away namri had orders to kill me no matter what i did his orders were from alia are you a truthsayer then i am another flat statement filled with selfassurance and ghanima as well no the preacher broke his silence then turning his blind sockets toward halleck but pointing at leto you think you can test him dont interfere when you know nothing of the problem or its consequences halleck ordered not looking at the man oh i know its consequences well enough the preacher said i was tested once by an old woman who thought she knew what she was doing she didnt know as it turned out halleck looked at him then youre another truthsayer anyone can be a truthsayer even you the preacher said its a matter of selfhonesty about the nature of your own feelings it requires that you have an inner agreement with truth which allows ready recognition why do you interfere halleck asked putting hand to crysknife who was this preacher im responsive to these events the preacher said my mother could put her own blood upon the altar but i have other motives and i do see your problem oh halleck was actually curious now the lady jessica ordered you to differentiate between the wolf and the dog between zeeb and keleb by her definition a wolf is someone with power who misuses that power however between wolf and dog there is a dawn period when you can not distinguish between them thats close to the mark halleck said noting how more and more people of the sietch had entered the common room to listen how do you know this because i know this planet you dont understand think how it is beneath the surface there are rocks dirt sediment sand thats the planets memory the picture of its history its the same with humans the dog remembers the wolf each universe revolves around a core of being and outward from that core go all of the memories right out to the surface very interesting halleck said how does that help me carry out my orders review the picture of your history which is within you communicate as animals would communicate halleck shook his head there was a compelling directness about this preacher a quality which hed recognized many times in the atreides and there was more than a little hint that the man was employing the powers of voice halleck felt his heart begin to hammer was it possible jessica wanted an ultimate test a stress by which the underlying fabric of her grandson exposed itself the preacher said but the fabrics always there open to your gaze halleck turned to stare at leto the movement came of itself compelled by irresistible forces the preacher continued as though lecturing an obstinate pupil this young person confuses you because hes not a singular being hes a community as with any community under stress any member of that community may assume command this command isnt always benign and we get our stories of abomination but youve already wounded this community enough gurney halleck cant you see that the transformation already has taken place this youth has achieved an inner cooperation which is enormously powerful that can not be subverted without eyes i see this once i opposed him but now i do his bidding he is the healer who are you halleck demanded im no more than what you see dont look at me look at this person you were ordered to teach and test he has been formed by crisis he survived a lethal environment he is here who are you halleck insisted i tell you only to look at this atreides youth he is the ultimate feedback upon which our species depends hell reinsert into the system the results of its past performance no other human could know that past performance as he knows it and you consider destroying such a one i was ordered to test him and ive not but you have is he abomination a weary laugh shook the preacher you persist in bene gesserit nonsense how they create the myths by which men sleep are you paul atreides halleck asked paul atreides is no more he tried to stand as a supreme moral symbol while he renounced all moral pretensions he became a saint without a god every word a blasphemy how can you think because you speak with his voice would you test me now beware gurney halleck halleck swallowed forced his attention back to the impassive leto who still stood calmly observant whos being tested the preacher asked is it perhaps that the lady jessica tests you gurney halleck halleck found this thought deeply disturbing wondering why he let this preachers words move him but it was a deep thing in atreides servants to obey that autocratic mystique jessica explaining this had made it even more mysterious halleck now felt something changing within himself a something whose edges had only been touched by the bene gesserit training jessica had pressed upon him inarticulate fury arose in him he did not want to change which of you plays god and to what end the preacher asked you can not rely on reason alone to answer that question slowly deliberately halleck raised his attention from leto to the blind man jessica kept saying he should achieve the balance of kairits thou shaltthou shalt not she called it a discipline without words and phrases no rules or arguments it was the sharpened edge of his own internal truth allengrossing something in the blind mans voice his tone his manner ignited a fury which burned itself into blinding calmness within halleck answer my question the preacher said halleck felt the words deepen his concentration upon this place this one moment and its demands his position in the universe was defined only by his concentration no doubt remained in him this was paul atreides not dead but returned and this nonchild leto halleck looked once more at leto really saw him he saw the signs of stress around the eyes the sense of balance in the stance the passive mouth with its quirking sense of humor leto stood out from his background as though at the focus of a blinding light he had achieved harmony simply by accepting it tell me paul halleck said does your mother know the preacher sighed to the sisterhood all achieved harmony simply by accepting it tell me paul halleck said does your mother know the preacher sighed to the sisterhood all of it i am dead do not try to revive me still not looking at him halleck asked but why does she she does what she must she makes her own life thinking she rules many lives thus we all play god but youre alive halleck whispered overcome now by his realization turning at last to stare at this man younger than himself but so aged by the desert that he appeared to carry twice hallecks years what is that paul demanded alive halleck peered around them at the watching fremen their faces caught between doubt and awe my mother never had to learn my lesson it was pauls voice to be a god can ultimately become boring and degrading thered be reason enough for the invention of free will a god might wish to escape into sleep and be alive only in the unconscious projections of his dreamcreatures but youre alive halleck spoke louder now paul ignored the excitement in his old companions voice asked would you really have pitted this lad against his sister in the testmashhad what deadly nonsense each would have said no kill me let the other live where would such a test lead what is it then to be alive gurney that was not the test halleck protested he did not like the way the fremen pressed closer around them studying paul ignoring leto but leto intruded now look at the fabric father yes yes paul held his head high as though sniffing the air its faradn then how easy it is to follow our thoughts instead of our senses leto said halleck had been unable to follow this thought and about to ask was interrupted by letos hand upon his arm dont ask gurney you might return to suspecting that im abomination no let it happen gurney if you try to force it youll only destroy yourself but halleck felt himself overcome by doubts jessica had warned him they can be very beguiling these preborn they have tricks youve never even dreamed halleck shook his head slowly and paul gods below paul alive and in league with this question mark hed fathered the fremen around them could no longer be held back they pressed between halleck and paul between leto and paul shoving the two to the background the air was showered with hoarse questions are you muaddib are you truly muaddib is it true what he says tell us you must think of me only as the preacher paul said pushing against them i can not be paul atreides or muaddib never again im not chanis mate or emperor halleck fearing what might happen if these frustrated questions found no logical answer was about to act when leto moved ahead of him it was there halleck first saw an element of the terrible change which had been wrought in leto a bull voice roared stand aside and leto moved forward thrusting adult fremen right and left knocking them down clubbing them with his hands wrenching knives from their hands by grasping the blades in less than a minute those fremen still standing were pressed back against the walls in silent consternation leto stood beside his father when shaihulud speaks you obey leto said and when a few of the fremen had started to argue leto had torn a corner of rock from the passage wall beside the rooms exit and crumbled it in his bare hands smiling all the while i will tear your sietch down around your faces he said the desert demon someone whispered and your qanats leto agreed i will rip them apart we have not been here do you hear me heads shook from side to side in terrified submission no one here has seen us leto said one whisper from you and i will return to drive you into the desert without water halleck saw hands being raised in the warding gesture the sign of the worm we will go now my father and i accompanied by our old friend leto said make our thopter ready and leto had guided them to shuloch then explaining enroute that they must move swiftly because faradn will be here on arrakis very soon and as my father has said then youll see the real test gurney looking down from the shuloch butte halleck asked himself once more as he asked every day what test what does he mean but leto was no longer in shuloch and paul refused to answer church and state scientific reason and faith the individual and his community even progress and tradition all of these can be reconciled in the teachings of muaddib he taught us that there exist no intransigent opposites except in the beliefs of men anyone can rip aside the veil of time you can discover the future in the past or in your own imagination doing this you win back your consciousness in your inner being you know then that the universe is a coherent whole and you are indivisible from it the preacher at arrakeen after harq alada ghanima sat far back outside the circle of light from the spice lamps and watched this buer agarves she didnt like his round face and agitated eyebrows his way of moving his feet when he spoke as though his words were a hidden music to which he danced hes not here to parley with stil ghanima told herself seeing this confirmed in every word and movement from this man she moved farther back away from the council circle every sietch had a room such as this one but the meeting hall of the abandoned djedida struck ghanima as a cramped place because it was so low sixty people from stilgars band plus the nine whod come with agarves filled only one end of the hall spiceoil lamps reflected against low beams which supported the ceiling the light cast wavering shadows which danced on the walls and the pungent smoke filled the place with the smell of cinnamon the meeting had started at dusk after the moisture prayers and evening meal it had been going on for more than an hour now and ghanima couldnt fathom the hidden currents in agarvess performance his words appeared clear enough but his motions and eye movements didnt agree agarves was speaking now responding to a question from one of stilgars lieutenants a niece of harahs named rajia she was a darkly ascetic young woman whose mouth turned down at the corners giving her an air of perpetual distrust ghanima found the expression satisfying in the circumstances certainly i believe alia will grant a full and complete pardon to all of you agarves said id not be here with this message otherwise stilgar intervened as rajia made to speak once more im not so much worried about our trusting her as i am about whether she trusts you stilgars voice carried growling undertones he was uncomfortable with this suggestion that he return to his old status it doesnt matter whether she trusts me agarves said to be candid about it i dont believe she does ive been too long searching for you without finding you but ive always felt she didnt really want you captured she was she was the wife of the man i slew stilgar said i grant you that he asked for it might just as wellve fallen on his own knife but this new attitude smells of agarves danced to his feet anger plain on his face she forgives you how many times must i say it she had the priests make a great show of asking divine guidance from youve only raised another issue it was irulan leaning forward past rajia blonde head set off against rajias darkness she has convinced you but she may have other plans the priesthood has but there are all of these stories irulan said that youre more than just a military advisor that youre her enough agarves was beside himself with rage his hand hovered near his knife warring emotions moved just below the surface of his skin twisting his features believe what you will but i can not go on with that woman she fouls me she dirties everything she touches i am used i am soiled but i have not lifted my knife against my kin now no more ghanima observing this thought that at least was truth coming out of him surprisingly stilgar broke into laughter ahhhh cousin he said forgive me but theres truth in anger then you agree ive not said that he raised a hand as agarves threatened another outburst its not for my sake buer but there are these others he gestured around him they are my responsibility let us consider for a moment what reparations alia offers reparations theres no word of reparations pardon but no then what does she offer as surety of her word sietch tabr and you as naib full autonomy as a neutral she understands now how ill not go back to her entourage or provide her with fighting men stilgar warned is that understood ghanima could hear stilgar beginning to weaken and thought no stil no no need for that agarves said alia wants only ghanima returned to her and the carrying out of the betrothal promise which she so now it comes out stilgar said his brows drawing down ghanimas the price of my pardon does she think me she thinks you sensible agarves argued resuming his seat gleefully ghanima thought he wont do it save your breath he wont do it as she thought this ghanima heard a soft rustling behind and to her left she started to turn felt powerful hands grab her a heavy rag reeking of sleepdrugs covered her face before she could cry out as consciousness faded she felt herself being carried toward a door in the halls darkest reaches and she thought i should have guessed i shouldve been prepared but the hands that held her were adult and strong she could not squirm away from them ghanimas last sensory impressions were of cold air a glimpse of stars and a hooded face which looked down at her then asked she wasnt injured was she the answer was lost as the stars wheeled and streaked across her gaze losing themselves in a blaze of light which was the inner core of her selfdom muaddib gave us a particular kind of knowledge about prophetic insight about the behavior which surrounds such insight and its influence upon events which are seen to be on line that is events which are set to occur in a related system which the prophet reveals and interprets as has been noted elsewhere such insight operates as a peculiar trap for the prophet himself he can become the victim of what he knows which is a relatively common human failing the danger is that those who predict real events may overtook the polarizing effect brought about by overindulgence in their own truth they tend to forget that nothing in a polarized universe can exist without its opposite being present the prescient vision by harq alada blowing sand hung like fog on the horizon obscuring the rising sun the sand was cold in the dune shadows leto stood outside the ring of the palmyrie looking into the desert he smelled dust and the aroma of spiny plants heard the morning sounds of people and animals the fremen maintained no qanat in this place they had only a bare minimum of hand planting irrigated by the women who carried water in skin bags their windtrap was a fragile thing easily destroyed by the stormwinds but easily rebuilt hardship the rigors of the spice trade and adventure were a way of life here these fremen still believed heaven was the sound of running water but they cherished an ancient concept of freedom which leto shared freedom is a lonely state he thought leto adjusted the folds of the white robe which covered his living stillsuit he could feel how the sandtrout membrane had changed him and as always with this feeling he was forced to overcome a deep sense of loss he no longer was completely human odd things swam in his blood sandtrout cilia had penetrated every organ adjusting changing the sandtrout itself was changing adapting but leto knowing this felt himself torn by the old threads of his lost humanity his life caught in primal anguish with its ancient continuity shattered he knew the trap of indulging in such emotion though he knew it well let the future happen of itself he thought the only rule governing creativity is the act of creation itself it was difficult to take his gaze away from the sands the dunes the great emptiness here at the edge of the sand lay a few rocks but they led the imagination outward into the winds the dust the sparse and lonely plants and animals dune merging into dune desert into desert behind him came the sound of a flute playing for the morning prayer the chant for moisture which now was a subtly altered serenade to the new shaihulud this knowledge in letos mind gave the music a sense of eternal loneliness i could just walk away into that desert he thought everything would change then one direction would be as good as another he had already learned to live a life free of possessions he had refined the fremen mystique to a terrible edge everything he took with him was necessary and that was all he took but he carried nothing except the robe on his back the atreides hawk ring hidden in its folds and the skinwhichwasnothisown it would be easy to walk away from here movement high in the sky caught his attention the splayedgap wingtips identified a vulture the sight filled his chest with aching like the wild fremen vultures lived in this land because this was where they were born they knew nothing better the desert made them what they were another fremen breed was coming up in the wake of muaddib and alia though they were the reason he could not let himself walk away into the desert as his father had done leto recalled idahos words from the early days these fremen theyre magnificently alive ive never met a greedy fremen there were plenty of greedy fremen now a wave of sadness passed over leto he was committed to a course which could change all of that but at a terrible price and the management of that course became increasingly difficult as they neared the vortex kralizec the typhoon struggle lay ahead but kralizec or worse would be the price of a misstep voices sounded behind leto then the clear piping sound of a child speaking here he is leto turned the preacher had come out of the palmyrie led by a child why do i still think of him as the preacher leto wondered the answer lay there on the clean tablet of letos mind because this is no longer muaddib no longer paul atreides the desert had made him what he was the desert and the jackals of jacurutu with their overdoses of melange and their constant betrayals the preacher was old before his time old not despite the spice but because of it they said you wanted to see me now the preacher said speaking as his child guide stopped leto looked at the child of the palmyrie a person almost as tall as himself with awe tempered by an avaricious curiosity the young eyes glinted darkly above the childsized stillsuit mask leto waved a hand leave us for a moment there was rebellion in the childs shoulders then the awe and native fremen respect for privacy took over the child left them you know faradn is here on arrakis leto asked gurney told me when he flew me down last night and the preacher thought how coldly measured his words are hes like i was in the old days i face a difficult choice leto said i thought youd already made all the choices we know that trap father the preacher cleared his throat the tensions told him how near they were to the shattering crisis now leto would not be relying on pure vision but on vision management you need my help the preacher asked yes im returning to arrakeen and i wish to go as your guide to what end would you preach once more in arrakeen perhaps there are things ive not said to them you will not come back to the desert father if i go with you yes ill do whatever you decide have you considered with faradn there your mother will be with him undoubtedly once more the preacher cleared his throat it was a betrayal of nervousness which muaddib would never have permitted this flesh had been too long away from the old regimen of selfdiscipline his mind too often betrayed into madness by the jacurutu and the preacher thought that perhaps it wouldnt be wise to return to arrakeen you dont have to go back there with me leto said but my sister is there and i must return you could go with gurney and youd go to arrakeen alone yes i must meet faradn i will go with you the preacher sighed and leto sensed a touch of the old vision madness in the preachers manner wondered has he been playing the prescience game no hed never go that way again he knew the trap of a partial commitment the preachers every word confirmed that he had handed over the visions to his son knowing that everything in this universe had been anticipated it was the old polarities which taunted the preacher now he had fled from paradox into paradox well be leaving in a few minutes then leto said will you tell gurney gurneys not going with us i want gurney to survive the preacher opened himself to the tensions then they were in the air around him in the ground under his feet a motile thing which focused onto the nonchild who was his son the blunt scream of his old visions waited in the preachers throat this cursed holiness the sandy juice of his fears could not be avoided he knew what faced them in arrakeen they would play a game once more with terrifying and deadly forces which could never bring them peace the child who refuses to travel in the fathers harness this is the symbol of mans most unique capability i do not have to be what my father was i do not have to obey my fathers rules or even believe everything he believed it is my strength as a human that i can make my own choices of what to believe and what not to believe of what to be and what not to be leto atreides ii the harq alada biography pilgrim women were dancing to drum and flute in the temple plaza no coverings on their heads bangles at their necks their dresses thin and revealing their long black hair was thrown straight out then straggled across their faces as they whirled alia looked down at the scene from her temple aerie both attracted and repelled it was midmorning the hour when the aroma of spicecoffee began to waft across the plaza from the vendors beneath the shaded arches soon she would have to go out and greet faradn present the formal gifts and supervise his first meeting with ghanima it was all working out according to plan ghani would kill him and in the shattering aftermath only one person would be prepared to pick up the pieces the puppets danced when the strings were pulled stilgar had killed agarves just as shed hoped and agarves had led the kidnappers to the djedida without knowing it a secret signal transmitter hidden in the new boots shed given him now stilgar and irulan waited in the temple dungeons perhaps they would die but there might be other uses for them there was no harm in waiting she noted that town fremen were watching the pilgrim dancers below her their eyes intense and unwavering a basic sexual equality had come out of the desert to persist in fremen town and city but social differences between male and female already were making themselves felt that too went according to plan divide and weaken alia could sense the subtle change in the way the two fremen watched those offplanet women and their exotic dance let them watch let them fill their minds with ghafla the louvers of alias window had been opened and she could feel a sharp increase in the heat which began about sunrise in this season and would peak in midafternoon the temperature on the stone floor of the plaza would be much higher it would be uncomfortable for those dancers but still they whirled and bent swung their arms and their hair in the frenzy of their dedication they had dedicated their dance to alia the womb of heaven an aide had come to whisper this to alia sneering at the offworld women and their peculiar ways the aide had explained that the women were from lx where remnants of the forbidden science and technology remained alia sniffed those women were as ignorant as superstitious and backward as the desert fremen just as that sneering aide had said trying to curry favor by reporting the dedication of the dance and neither the aide nor the ixians even knew that ix was merely a number in a forgotten language laughing lightly to herself alia thought let them dance the dancing wasted energy which might be put to more destructive uses and the music was pleasant a thin wailing played against flat tympani from gourd drums and clapped hands abruptly the music was drowned beneath a roaring of many voices from the plazas far side the dancers missed a step recovered in a brief confusion but they had lost their sensuous singleness and even their attention wandered to the far gate of the plaza where a mob could be seen spreading onto the stones like water rushing through the opened valve of a qanat alia stared at that oncoming wave she heard words now and one above all others preacher preacher then she saw him striding with the first spread of the wave one hand on the shoulder of his young guide the pilgrim dancers gave up their whirling retired to the terraced steps below alia they were joined by their audience and alia sensed awe in the watchers her own emotion was fear how dare he she half turned to summon guards but second thoughts stopped her the mob already filled the plaza they could turn ugly if thwarted in their obvious desire to hear the blind visionary alia clenched her fists the preacher why was paul doing this to half the population he was a desert madman and therefore sacred others whispered in the bazaars and shops that it must be muaddib why else did the mahdinate let him speak such angry heresy alia could see refugees among the mob remnants from the abandoned sietches their robes in tatters that would be a dangerous place down there a place where mistakes could be made mistress the voice came from behind alia she turned saw zia standing in the arched doorway to the outer chamber armed house guards were close behind her yes zia my lady faradn is out here requesting audience here in my chambers yes my lady is he alone two bodyguards and the lady jessica alia put a hand to her throat remembering her last encounter with her mother times had changed though new conditions ruled their relationship how impetuous he is alia said what reason does he give he has heard about zia pointed to the window over the plaza he says he was told you have the best vantage alia frowned do you believe this zia no my lady i think he has heard the rumors he wants to watch your reaction my mother put him up to this quite possibly my lady zia my dear i want you to carry out a specific set of very important orders for me come here zia approached to within a pace my lady have faradn his guards and my mother admitted then prepare to bring ghanima she is to be accoutered as a fremen bride in every detail complete with knife my lady with knife my lady thats ghanima poses no threat to me my lady theres reason to believe she fled with stilgar more to protect him than for any other zia my lady ghanima already has made her plea for stilgars life and stilgar remains alive but shes the heir presumptive just carry out my orders have ghanima prepared while youre seeing to that send five attendants from the temple priesthood out into the plaza theyre to invite the preacher up here have them wait their opportunity and speak to him nothing more they are to use no force i want them to issue a polite invitation absolutely no force and zia my lady how sullen she sounded the preacher and ghanima are to be brought before me simultaneously they are to enter together upon my signal do you understand i know the plan my lady but just do it together and alia nodded dismissal to the amazon aide as zia turner and left alia said on your way out send in faradns party but see that theyre preceded by ten of your most trustworthy people zia glanced back but continued leaving the room it will be done as you command my lady alia turned away to peer out the window in just a few minutes the plan would bear its bloody fruit and paul would be here when his daughter delivered the coup de grace to his holy pretensions alia heard zias guard detachment entering it would be over soon all over she looked down with a swelling sense of triumph as the preacher took his stance on the first step his youthful guide squatted beside him alia saw the yellow robes of temple priests waiting on the left held back by the press of the crowd they were experienced with crowds however theyd find a way to approach their target the preachers voice boomed out over the plaza and the mob waited upon his words with rapt attention let them listen soon his words would be made to mean other things than he intended and thered be no preacher around to protest she heard faradns party enter jessicas voice alia without turning alia said welcome prince faradn mother come and enjoy the show she glanced back then saw the big sardaukar tyekanik scowling at her guards who were blocking the way but this isnt hospitable alia said let them approach two of her guards obviously acting on zias orders came up to her and stood between her and the others the other guards moved aside alia backed to the right side of the window motioned to it this is truly the best vantage point jessica wearing her traditional black aba robe glared at alia escorted faradn to the window but stood between him and alias guards this is very kind of you lady alia faradn said ive heard so much about this preacher and there he is in the flesh alia said she saw that faradn wore the dress grey of a sardaukar commander without decorations he moved with a lean grace which alia admired perhaps there would be more than idle amusement in this corrino prince the preachers voice boomed into the room over the amplifier pickups beside the window alia felt the tremors of it in her bones began to listen to his words with growing fascination i found myself in the desert of zan the preacher shouted in that waste of howling wilderness and god commanded me to make that place clean for we were provoked in the desert and grieved in the desert and we were tempted in that wilderness to forsake our ways desert of zan alia thought that was the name given to the place of the first trial of the zensunni wanderers from whom the fremen sprang but his words was he taking credit for the destruction wrought against the sietch strongholds of the loyal tribes wild beasts lie upon your lands the preacher said his voice booming across the plaza doleful creatures fill your houses you who fled your homes no longer multiply your days upon the sand yea you who have forsaken our ways you will die in a fouled nest if you continue on this path but if you heed my warning the lord shall lead you through a land of pits into the mountains of god yea shaihulud shall lead you soft moans arose from the crowd the preacher paused swinging his eyeless sockets from side to side at the sound then he raised his arms spreading them wide called out o god my flesh longeth for thy way in a dry and thirsty land an old woman in front of the preacher an obvious refugee by the patched and worn look of her garments held up her hands to him pleaded help us muaddib help us in a sudden fearful constriction of her breast alia asked herself if that old woman really knew the truth alia glanced at her mother but jessica remained unmoving dividing her attention between alias guards faradn and the view from the window faradn stood rooted in fascinated attention alia glanced out the window trying to see her temple priests they were not in view and she suspected they had worked their way around below her near the temple doors seeking a direct route down the steps the preacher pointed his right hand over the old womans head shouted you are the only help remaining you were rebellious you brought the dry wind which does not cleanse nor does it cool you bear the burden of our desert and the whirlwind cometh from that place from that terrible land i have been in that wilderness water runs upon the sand from shattered qanats streams cross the ground water has fallen from the sky in the belt of dune o my friends god has commanded me make straight in the desert a highway for our lord for i am the voice that cometh to thee from the wilderness he pointed to the steps beneath his feet a stiff and quivering finger this is no lost djedida which is no more inhabited forever here have we eaten the bread of heaven and here the noise of strangers drives us from our homes they breed for us a desolation a land wherein no man dwelleth nor any man pass thereby the crowd stirred uncomfortably refugees and town fremen peering about looking at the pilgrims of the hajj who stood among them he could start a bloody riot alia thought well let him my priests can grab him in the confusion she saw the five priests then a tight knot of yellow robes working down the steps behind the preacher the waters which we spread upon the desert have become blood the preacher said waving his arms wide blood upon our land behold our desert which could rejoice and blossom it has lured the stranger and seduced him in our midst they come for violence their faces are closed up as for the last wind of kralizec they gather the captivity of the sand they suck up the abundance of the sand the treasure hidden in the depths behold them as they go forth to their evil work it is written and i stood upon the sand and i saw a beast rise up out of that sand and upon the head of that beast was the name of god angry mutterings arose from the crowd fists were raised shaken what is he doing faradn whispered i wish i knew alia said she put a hand to her breast feeling the fearful excitement of this moment the crowd would turn upon the pilgrims if he kept this up but the preacher half turned aimed his dead sockets toward the temple and raised a hand to point at the high windows of alias aerie one blasphemy remains he screamed blasphemy and the name of that blasphemy is alia shocked silence gripped the plaza alia stood in unmoving consternation she knew the mob could not see her but she felt overcome by a sense of exposure of vulnerability the echoes of calming words within her skull competed with the pounding of her heart she could only stare down at that incredible tableau the preacher remained with a hand pointing at her windows his words had been too much for the priests though they broke the silence with angry shouts stormed down the steps thrusting people aside as they moved the crowd reacted breaking like a wave upon the steps sweeping over the first lines of onlookers carrying the preacher before them he stumbled blindly separated from his young guide then a yellowclad arm arose from the press of people a crysknife was brandished in its hand she saw the knife strike downward bury itself in the preachers chest the thunderous clang of the temples giant doors being closed broke alia from her shock guards obviously had closed the doors against the mob but people already were drawing back making an open space around a crumpled figure on the steps an eerie quiet fell over the plaza alia saw many bodies but only this one lay by itself then a voice screeched from the mob muaddib theyve killed muaddib gods below alia quavered gods below a little late for that dont you think jessica asked alia whirled noting the sudden startled reaction of faradn as he saw the rage on her face that was paul they killed alia screamed that was your son when they confirm it do you know whatll happen jessica stood rooted for a long moment thinking that she had just been told something already known to her faradns hand upon her arm shattered the moment my lady he said and there was such compassion in his voice that jessica thought she might die of it right there she looked from the cold glaring anger on alias face to the sympathetic misery on faradns features and thought perhaps i did my job too well there could be no doubting alias words jessica remembered every intonation of the preachers voice hearing her own tricks in it the long years of instruction shed spent there upon a young man meant to be emperor but who now lay a shattered mound of bloody rags upon the temple steps ghafla blinded me jessica thought alia gestured to one of her aides called bring ghanima now jessica forced herself into recognizing these words ghanima why ghanima now the aide had turned toward the outer door motioning for it to be unbarred but before a word could be uttered the door bulged hinges popped the bar snapped and the door a thick plasteel construction meant to withstand terrible energies toppled into the room guards leaped to avoid it drawing their weapons jessica and faradns bodyguards closed in around the corrino prince but the opening revealed only two children ghanima on the left clad in her black betrothal robe and leto on the right the grey slickness of a stillsuit beneath a desertstained white robe alia stared from the fallen door to the children found she was trembling uncontrollably the family here to greet us leto said grandmother he nodded to jessica shifted his attention to the corrino prince and this must be prince faradn welcome to arrakis prince ghanimas eyes appeared empty she held her right hand on a ceremonial crysknife at her waist and she appeared to be trying to escape from letos grip on her arm leto shook her arm and her whole body shook with it behold me family leto said i am ari the lion of the atreides and here again he shook ghanimas arm with that powerful ease which set her whole body jerking here is aryeh the atreides lioness we come to set you onto secher nbiw the golden path ghanima absorbing the trigger words secher nbiw felt the lockedaway consciousness flow into her mind it flowed with a linear nicety the inner awareness of her mother hovering there behind it a guardian at a gate and ghanima knew in that instant that she had conquered the clamorous past she possessed a gate through which she could peer when she needed that past the months of selfhypnotic suppression had built for her a safe place from which to manage her own flesh she started to turn toward leto with the need to explain this when she became aware of where she stood and with whom leto released her arm did our plan work ghanima whispered well enough leto said recovering from her shock alia shouted at a clump of guards on her left seize them but leto bent took the fallen door with one hand skidded it across the room into the guards two were pinned against the wall the others fell back in terror that door weighed half a metric ton and this child had thrown it alia growing aware that the corridor beyond the doorway contained fallen guards realized that leto must have dealt with them that this child had shattered her impregnable door jessica too had seen the bodies seen the awesome power in leto and had made similar assumptions but ghanimas words touched a core of bene gesserit discipline which forced jessica to maintain her composure this grandchild spoke of a plan what plan jessica asked the golden path our imperial plan for our imperium leto said he nodded to faradn dont think harshly of me cousin i act for you as well alia hoped to have ghanima slay you id rather you lived out your life in some degree of happiness alia screamed at her guards cowering in the passage i command you to seize them but the guards refused to enter the room wait for me here sister leto said i have a disagreeable task to perform he moved across the room toward alia she backed away from him into a corner crouched and drew her knife the green jewels of its handle flashed in the light from the window leto merely continued his advance hands empty but spread and ready alia lunged with the knife leto leaped almost to the ceiling struck with his left foot it caught alias head a glancing blow and sent her sprawling with a bloody mark on her forehead she lost her grip on the knife and it skidded across the floor alia scrambled after the knife but found leto standing in front of her alia hesitated called up everything she knew of bene gesserit training she came off the floor body loose and poised once more leto advanced upon her alia feinted to the left but her right shoulder came up and her right foot shot out in a toepointing kick which could disembowel a man if it struck precisely leto caught the blow on his arm grabbed the foot and picked her up by it swinging her around his head the speed with which he swung her sent a flapping hissing sound through the room as her robe beat against her body the others ducked away alia screamed and screamed but still she continued to swing around and around and around presently she fell silent slowly leto reduced the speed of her whirling dropped her gently to the floor she lay in a panting bundle leto bent over her i couldve thrown you through a wall he said perhaps that wouldve been best but were now at the center of the struggle you deserve your chance alias eyes darted wildly from side to side i have conquered those inner lives leto said look at ghani she too can ghanima interrupted alia i can show you no the word was wrenched from alia her chest heaved and voices began to pour from her mouth they were disconnected cursing pleading you see why didnt you listen and again whyre you doing this whats happening and another voice stop them make them stop jessica covered her eyes felt faradns hand steady her still alia raved ill kill you hideous curses erupted from her ill drink your blood the sounds of many languages began to pour from her all jumbled and confused the huddled guards in the outer passage made the sign of the worm then held clenched fists beside their ears she was possessed leto stood shaking his head he stepped to the window and with three swift blows shattered the supposedly unbreakable crystalreinforced glass from its frame a sly look came over alias face jessica heard something like her own voice come from that twisting mouth a parody of bene gesserit control all of you stay where you are jessica lowering her hands found them damp with tears alia rolled to her knees lurched to her feet dont you know who i am she demanded it was her old voice the sweet and lilting voice of the youthful alia who was no more whyre you all looking at me that way she turned pleading eyes to jessica mother make them stop it jessica could only shake her head from side to side consumed by ultimate horror all of the old bene gesserit warnings were true she looked at leto and ghani standing side by side near alia what did those warnings mean for these poor twins grandmother leto said and there was pleading in his voice must we have a trial of possession who are you to speak of trial alia asked and her voice was that of a querulous man an autocratic and sensual man far gone in selfindulgence both leto and ghanima recognized the voice the old baron harkonnen ghanima heard the same voice begin to echo in her own head but the inner gate closed and she sensed her mother standing there jessica remained silent then the decision is mine leto said and the choice is yours alia trial of possession or he nodded toward the open window whore you to give me a choice alia demanded and it was still the voice of the old baron demon ghanima screamed let her make her own choice mother alia pleaded in her littlegirl tones mother whatre they doing what do you want me to do help me help yourself leto ordered and for just an instant he saw the shattered presence of his aunt in her eyes a glaring hopelessness which peered out at him and was gone but her body moved a sticklike thrusting walk she wavered stumbled veered from her path but returned to it nearer and nearer the open window now the voice of the old baron raged from her lips stop stop it i say i command you stop it feel this alia clutched her head stumbled closer to the window she had the sill against her thighs then but the voice still raved dont do this stop it and ill help you i have a plan listen to me stop it i say wait but alia pulled her hands away from her head clutched the broken casement in one jerking motion she pulled herself over the sill and was gone not even a screech came from her as she fell in the room they heard the crowd shout the sodden thump as alia struck the steps far below leto looked at jessica we told you to pity her jessica turned and buried her face in faradns tunic the assumption that a whole system can be made to work better through an assault on its conscious elements betrays a dangerous ignorance this has often been the ignorant approach of those who call themselves scientists and technologists the butlerian jihad by harq alada he runs at night cousin ghanima said he runs have you seen him run no faradn said he waited with ghanima outside the small audience hall of the keep where leto had called them to attend tyekanik stood at one side uncomfortable with the lady jessica who appeared withdrawn as though her mind lived in another place it was hardly an hour past the morning meal but already many things had been set moving a summons to the guild messages to choam and the landsraad faradn found it difficult to understand these atreides the lady jessica had warned him but still the reality of them puzzled him they still talked of the betrothal although most political reasons for it seemed to have dissolved leto would assume the throne there appeared little doubt of that his odd living skin would have to be removed of course but in time he runs to tire himself ghanima said hes kralizec embodied no wind ever ran as he runs hes a blur atop the dunes ive seen him he runs and runs and when he has exhausted himself at last he returns and rests his head in my lap ask our mother within to find a way for me to die he pleads faradn stared at her in the week since the riot in the plaza the keep had moved to strange rhythms mysterious comings and goings stories of bitter fighting beyond the shield wall came to him through tyekanik whose military advice had been asked i dont understand you faradn said find a way for him to die he asked me to prepare you ghanima said not for the first time she was struck by the curious innocence of this corrino prince was that jessicas doing or something born in him for what hes no longer human ghanima said yesterday you asked when he was going to remove the living skin never its part of him now and hes part of it leto estimates he has perhaps four thousand years before metamorphosis destroys him faradn tried to swallow in a dry throat you see why he runs ghanima asked but if hell live so long and be so because the memory of being human is so rich in him think of all those lives cousin no you cant imagine what that is because youve no experience of it but i know i can imagine his pain he gives more than anyone ever gave before our father walked into the desert trying to escape it alia became abomination in fear of it our grandmother has only the blurred infancy of this condition yet must use every bene gesserit wile to live with it which is what reverend mother training amounts to anyway but leto hes all alone never to be duplicated faradn felt stunned by her words emperor for four thousand years jessica knows ghanima said looking across at her grandmother he told her last night he called himself the first truly longrange planner in human history what does he plan the golden path hell explain it to you later and he has a role for me in this plan as my mate ghanima said hes taking over the sisterhoods breeding program im sure my grandmother told you about the bene gesserit dream for a male reverend with extraordinary powers hes you mean were just to be not just she took his arm squeezed it with a warm familiarity hell have many very responsible tasks for both of us when were not producing children that is well youre a little young yet faradn said disengaging his arm dont ever make that mistake again she said there was ice in her tone jessica came up to them with tyekanik tyek tells me the fighting has spread offplanet jessica said the central temple on biarek is under siege faradn thought her oddly calm in this statement hed reviewed the reports with tyekanik during the night a wildfire of rebellion was spreading through the empire it would be put down of course but leto would have a sorry empire to restore heres stilgar now ghanima said theyve been waiting for him and once more she took faradns arm the old fremen naib had entered by the far door escorted by two former death commando companions from the desert days all were dressed in formal black robes with white piping and yellow headbands for mourning they approached with steady strides but stilgar kept his attention on jessica he stopped in front of her nodded warily you still worry about the death of duncan idaho jessica said she didnt like this caution in her old friend reverend mother he said so its going to be that way jessica thought all formal and according to the fremen code with blood difficult to expunge she said by our view you but played apart which duncan assigned you not the first time a man has given his life for the atreides why do they do it stil youve been ready for it more than once why is it that you know how much the atreides give in return im happy you seek no excuse for revenge he said but there are matters i must discuss with your grandson these matters may separate us from you forever you mean tabr will not pay him homage ghanima asked i mean i reserve my judgment he looked coldly at ghanima i dont like what my fremen have become he growled we will go back to the old ways without you if necessary for a time perhaps ghanima said but the desert is dying stil whatll you do when there are no more worms no more desert i dont believe it within one hundred years ghanima said therell be fewer than fifty worms and those will be sick ones kept in a carefully managed reservation their spice will be for the spacing guild only and the price she shook her head ive seen letos figures hes been all over the planet he knows is this another trick to keep the fremen as your vassals when were you ever my vassal ghanima asked stilgar scowled no matter what he said or did these twins always made it his fault last night he told me about this golden path stilgar blurted i dont like it thats odd ghanima said glancing at her grandmother most of the empire will welcome it destruction of us all stilgar muttered but everyone longs for the golden age ghanima said isnt that so grandmother everyone jessica agreed they long for the pharaonic empire which leto will give them ghanima said they long for a rich peace with abundant harvests plentiful trade a leveling of all except the golden ruler itll be the death of the fremen stilgar protested how can you say that will we not need soldiers and brave men to remove the occasional dissatisfaction why stil you and tyeks brave companions will be hard pressed to do the job stilgar looked at the sardaukar officer and a strange light of understanding passed between them and leto will control the spice jessica reminded them hell control it absolutely ghanima said faradn listening with the new awareness which jessica had taught him heard a set piece a prepared performance between ghanima and her grandmother peace will endure and endure and endure ghanima said memory of war will all but vanish leto will lead humankind through that garden for at least four thousand years tyekanik glanced questioningly at faradn cleared his throat yes tyek faradn said id speak privately with you my prince faradn smiled knowing the question in tyekaniks military mind knowing that at least two others present also recognized this question ill not sell the sardaukar faradn said no need ghanima said do you listen to this child tyekanik demanded he was outraged the old naib there understood the problems being raised by all of this plotting but nobody else knew a damned thing about the situation ghanima smiled grimly said tell him faradn faradn sighed it was easy to forget the strangeness of this child who was not a child he could imagine a lifetime married to her the hidden reservations on every intimacy it was not a totally pleasant prospect but he was beginning to recognize its inevitability absolute control of dwindling spice supplies nothing would move in the universe without the spice later tyek faradn said but later i said for the first time he used voice on tyekanik saw the man blink with surprise and remain silent a tight smile touched jessicas mouth he talks of peace and death in the same breath stilgar muttered golden age ghanima said hell lead humans through the cult of death into the free air of exuberant life he speaks of death because thats necessary stil its a tension by which the living know theyre alive when his empire falls oh yes itll fall you think this is kralizec now but kralizec is yet to come and when it comes humans will have renewed their memory of what its like to be alive the memory will persist as long as theres a single human living well go through the crucible once more stil and well come out of it we always arise from our own ashes always faradn hearing her words understood now what shed meant in telling him about leto running hell not be human stilgar was not yet convinced no more worms he growled oh the worms will come back ghanima assured him all will be dead within two hundred years but theyll come back how stilgar broke off faradn felt his mind awash in revelation he knew what ghanima would say before she spoke the guild will barely make it through the lean years and only then because of its stockpiles and ours ghanima said but therell be abundance after kralizec the worms will return after my brother goes into the sand as with so many other religions muaddibs golden elixir of life degenerated into external wizardry its mystical signs became mere symbols for deeper psychological processes and those processes of course ran wild what they needed was a living god and they didnt have one a situation which muaddibs son has corrected saying attributed to lu tungpin lu the guest of the cavern leto sat on the lion throne to accept the homage of the tribes ghanima stood beside him one step down the ceremony in the great hall went on for hours tribe after fremen tribe passed before him through their delegates and their naibs each group bore gifts fitting for a god of terrifying powers a god of vengeance who promised them peace hed cowed them into submission the previous week performing for the assembled arifa of all the tribes the judges had seen him walk through a pit of fire emerging unscathed to demonstrate that his skin bore no marks by asking them to study him closely hed ordered them to strike him with knives and the impenetrable skin had sealed his face while they struck at him to no avail acids ran off him with only the lightest mist of smoke hed eaten their poisons and laughed at them at the end hed summoned a worm and stood facing them at its mouth hed moved from that to the landing field at arrakeen where hed brazenly toppled a guild frigate by lifting one of its landing fins the arifa had reported all of this with a fearful awe and now the tribal delegates had come to seal their submission the vaulted space of the great hall with its acoustical dampening systems tended to absorb sharp noises but a constant rustling of moving feet insinuated itself into the senses riding on dust and the flint odors brought in from the open jessica whod refused to attend watched from a high spy hole behind the throne her attention was caught by faradn and the realization that both she and faradn had been outmaneuvered of course leto and ghanima had anticipated the sisterhood the twins could consult within themselves a host of bene gesserits greater than all now living in the empire she was particularly bitter at the way the sisterhoods mythology had trapped alia fear built on fear the habits of generations had imprinted the fate of abomination upon her alia had known no hope of course shed succumbed her fate made the accomplishment of leto and ghanima even more difficult to face not one way out of the trap but two ghanimas victory over the inner lives and her insistence that alia deserved only pity were the bitterest things of all hypnotic suppression under stress linked to the wooing of a benign ancestor had saved ghanima they might have saved alia but without hope nothing had been attempted until it was too late alias water had been poured upon the sand jessica sighed shifted her attention to leto on the throne a giant canopic jar containing the water of muaddib occupied a place of honor at his right elbow hed boasted to jessica that his fatherwithin laughed at this gesture even while admiring it that jar and the boasting had firmed her resolve not to participate in this ritual as long as she lived she knew she could never accept paul speaking through letos mouth she rejoiced that house atreides had survived but the thingsthatmighthavebeen were beyond bearing faradn sat crosslegged beside the jar of muaddibs water it was the position of the royal scribe an honor newly conferred and newly accepted faradn felt that he was adjusting nicely to these new realities although tyekanik still raged and promised dire consequences tyekanik and stilgar had formed a partnership of distrust which seemed to amuse leto in the hours of the homage ceremony faradn had gone from awe to boredom to awe they were an endless stream of humanity these peerless fighting men their loyalty renewed to the atreides on the throne could not be questioned they stood in submissive terror before him completely daunted by what the arifa had reported at last it drew to a close the final naib stood before leto stilgar in the rearguard position of honor instead of panniers heavy with spice fire jewels or any of the other costly gifts which lay in mounds around the throne stilgar bore a headband of braided spicefiber the atreides hawk had been worked in gold and green into its design ghanima recognized it and shot a sidewise glance at leto stilgar placed the headband on the second step below the throne bowed low i give you the headband worn by your sister when i took her into the desert to protect her he said leto suppressed a smile i know youve fallen on hard times stilgar leto said is there something here you would have in return he gestured at the piles of costly gifts no my lord i accept your gift then leto said he rocked forward brought up the hem of ghanimas robe ripped a thin strip from it in return i give you this bit of ghanimas robe the robe she wore when she was stolen from your desert camp forcing me to save her stilgar accepted the cloth in a trembling hand do you mock me my lord mock you by my name stilgar never would i mock you i have given you a gift without price i command you to carry it always next to your heart as a reminder that all humans are prone to error and all leaders are human a thin chuckle escaped stilgar what a naib you would have made what a naib i am naib of naibs never forget that as you say my lord stilgar swallowed remembering the report of his arifa and he thought once i thought of slaying him now its too late his glance fell on the jar a graceful opaque gold capped with green that is water of my tribe and mine leto said i command you to read the inscription upon its side read it aloud that all may hear it stilgar cast a questioning glance at ghanima but she returned it with a lift of her chin a cold response which sent a chill through him were these atreides imps bent on holding him to answer for his impetuosity and his mistakes read it leto said pointing slowly stilgar mounted the steps bent to look at the jar presently he read aloud this water is the ultimate essence a source of outward streaming creativity though motionless this water is the means of all movement what does it mean my lord stilgar whispered he felt awed by the words touched within himself in a place he could not understand the body of muaddib is a dry shell like that abandoned by an insect leto said he mastered the inner world while holding the outer in contempt and this led to catastrophe he mastered the outer world while excluding the inner world and this delivered his descendants to the demons the golden elixir will vanish from dune yet muaddibs seed goes on and his water moves our universe stilgar bowed his head mystical things always left him in turmoil the beginning and the end are one leto said you live in air but do not see it a phase has closed out of that closing grows the beginning of its opposite thus we will have kralizec everything returns later in changed form you have felt thoughts in your head your descendants will feel thoughts in their bellies return to sietch tabr stilgar gurney halleck will join you there as my advisor in your council dont you trust me my lord stilgars voice was low completely else id not send gurney to you hell begin recruiting the new force well need soon i accept your pledge of fealty stilgar you are dismissed stilgar bowed low backed off the steps turned and left the hall the other naibs fell into step behind him according to the fremen principle that the last shall be first but some of their queries could be heard on the throne as they departed what were you talking about up there stil what does that mean those words on muaddibs water leto spoke to faradn did you get all of that scribe yes my lord my grandmother tells me she trained you well in the mnemonic processes of the bene gesserit thats good i dont want you scribbling beside me as you command my lord come and stand before me leto said faradn obeyed more than ever thankful for jessicas training when you accepted the fact that leto no longer was human no longer could think as humans thought the course of his golden path became ever more frightening leto looked up at faradn the guards stood well back out of earshot only the counselors of the inner presence remained on the floor of the great hall and they stood in subservient groups well beyond the first step ghanima had moved closer to rest an arm on the back of the throne youve not yet agreed to give me your sardaukar leto said but you will i owe you much but not that faradn said you think theyd not mate well with my fremen as well as those new friends stilgar and tyekanik yet you refuse i await your offer then i must make the offer knowing you will never repeat it i pray my grandmother has done her part well that you are prepared to understand what must i understand theres always a prevailing mystique in any civilization leto said it builds itself as a barrier against change and that always leaves future generations unprepared for the universes treachery all mystiques are the same in building these barriers the religious mystique the heroleader mystique the messiah mystique the mystique of sciencetechnology and the mystique of nature itself we live in an imperium which such a mystique has shaped and now that imperium is falling apart because most people dont distinguish between mystique and their universe you see the mystique is like demon possession it tends to take over the consciousness becoming all things to the observer i recognize your grandmothers wisdom in these words faradn said well and good cousin she asked me if i were abomination i answered in the negative that was my first treachery you see ghanima escaped this but i did not i was forced to balance the inner lives under the pressure of excessive melange i had to seek the active cooperation of those aroused lives within me doing this i avoided the most malignant and chose a dominant helper thrust upon me by the inner awareness which was my father i am not in truth my father or this helper then again i am not the second leto explain you have an admirable directness leto said im a community dominated by one who was ancient and surpassingly powerful he fathered a dynasty which endured for three thousand of our years his name was harum and until his line trailed out in the congenital weaknesses and superstitions of a descendant his subjects lived in a rhythmic sublimity they moved unconsciously with the changes of the seasons they bred individuals who tended to be shortlived superstitious and easily led by a godking taken as a whole they were a powerful people their survival as a species became habit i dont like the sound of that faradn said nor do i really leto said but its the universe ill create why its a lesson i learned on dune we kept the presence of death a dominant specter among the living here by that presence the dead changed the living the people of such a society sink down into their bellies but when the time comes for the opposite when they arise they are great and beautiful that doesnt answer my question faradn protested you dont trust me cousin nor does your own grandmother and with good reason leto said but she acquiesces because she must bene gesserits are pragmatists in the end i share their view of our universe you know you wear the marks of that universe you retain the habits of rule cataloging all around you in terms of their possible threat or value i agreed to be your scribe it amused you and flattered your real talent which is that of historian youve a definite genius for reading the present in terms of the past youve anticipated me on several occasions i dont like your veiled insinuations faradn said good you come from infinite ambition to your present lowered estate didnt my grandmother warn you about infinity it attracts us like a floodlight in the night blinding us to the excesses it can inflict upon the finite bene gesserit aphorisms faradn protested but much more precise leto said the bene gesserit believed they could predict the course of evolution but they overlooked their own changes in the course of that evolution they assumed they would stand still while their breeding plan evolved i have no such reflexive blindness look carefully at me faradn for i am no longer human so your sister assures me faradn hesitated then abomination by the sisterhoods definition perhaps harum is cruel and autocratic i partake of his cruelty mark me well i have the cruelty of the husbandman and this human universe is my farm fremen once kept tame eagles as pets but ill keep a tame faradn faradns face darkened beware my claws cousin i well know my sardaukar would fall in time before your fremen but wed wound you sorely and there are jackals waiting to pick off the weak i will use you well that i promise leto said he leaned forward did i not say im no longer human believe me cousin no children will spring from my loins for i no longer have loins and this forces my second treachery faradn waited in silence seeing at last the direction of letos argument i shall go against every fremen precept leto said they will accept because they can do nothing else i kept you here under the lure of a betrothal but there will be no betrothal of you and ghanima my sister will marry me but you marry i said ghanima must continue the atreides line theres also the matter of the bene gesserit breeding program which is now my breeding program i refuse faradn said you refuse to father an atreides dynasty what dynasty youll occupy the throne for thousands of years and mold your descendants in my image it will be the most intensive the most inclusive training program in all of history well be an ecosystem in miniature you see whatever system animals choose to survive by must be based on the pattern of interlocking communities interdependence working together in the common design which is the system and this system will produce the most knowledgeable rulers ever seen you put fancy words on a most distasteful who will survive kralizec leto asked i promise you kralizec will come youre a madman you will shatter the empire of course i will and im not a man but ill create a new consciousness in all men i tell you that below the desert of dune theres a secret place with the greatest treasure of all time i do not lie when the last worm dies and the last melange is harvested upon our sands these deep treasures will spring up throughout our universe as the power of the spice monopoly fades and the hidden stockpiles make their mark new powers will appear throughout our realm it is time humans learned once more to live in their instincts ghanima took her arm from the back of the throne crossed to faradns side took his hand as my mother was not wife you will not be husband leto said but perhaps there will be love and that will be enough each day each moment brings its change ghanima said one learns by recognizing the moments faradn felt the warmth of ghanimas tiny hand as an insistent presence he recognized the ebb and flow of letos arguments but not once had voice been used it was an appeal to the guts not to the mind is this what you offer for my sardaukar he asked much much more cousin i offer your descendants the imperium i offer you peace what will be the outcome of your peace its opposite leto said his voice calmly mocking faradn shook his head i find the price for my sardaukar very high must i remain scribe the secret father of your royal line you must will you try to force me into your habit of peace i will ill resist you every day of my life but thats the function i expect of you cousin its why i chose you ill make it official i will give you a new name from this moment youll be called breaking of the habit which in our tongue is harq alada come cousin dont be obtuse my mother taught you well give me your sardaukar give them ghanima echoed hell have them one way or another faradn heard fear for himself in her voice love then leto asked not for reason but for an intuitive leap take them faradn said indeed leto said he lifted himself from the throne a curiously fluid motion as though he kept his terrible powers under most delicate control leto stepped down then to ghanimas level moved her gently until she faced away from him turned and placed his back against hers note this cousin harq alada this is the way it will always be with us well stand thus when we are married back to back each looking outward from the other to protect the one thing which we have always been he turned looked mockingly at faradn lowered his voice remember that cousin when youre face to face with my ghanima remember that when you whisper of love and soft things when you are most tempted by the habits of my peace and my contentment your back will remain exposed turning from them he strode down the steps into the waiting courtiers picked them up in his wake like satellites and left the hall ghanima once more took faradns hand but her gaze looked beyond the far end of the hall long after leto had left it one of us had to accept the agony she said and he was always the stronger
