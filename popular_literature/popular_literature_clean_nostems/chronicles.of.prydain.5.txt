the chronicles of prydain book five the high king lloyd alexander authors note despite their shortcomings no books have given me greater joy in the writing than the chronicles of prydain i come sadly to the end of this journey aware of the impossibility of commenting objectively on a work which has absorbed me so long and so personally i must however warn readers of this fifth chronicle to expect the unexpected its structure is somewhat different its range wider if there is more external conflict i have tried to add more inner content if the form follows that of the traditional herotale the individuals i hope are genuinely human and although it deals with a battle on an epic scale where taran princess eilonwy fflewddur fflam even the oracular pig hen wen are pressed to the limits of their strength it is a battle whose aftermath is deeper in consequences than the struggle itself the final choice which even faithful gurgi can not avoid is almost too hard to bear fortunately it is never offered to us in the real world not at least in such unmistakable terms in another sense we face this kind of choice again and again because for us it is never final whether the assistant pigkeeper chose well whether the ending is happy heartbreaking or both readers must decide for themselves like the previous tales this adventure can be read independently of the others nevertheless certain longstanding questions are resolved here why was that sneering scoundrel magg allowed to escape from the castle of llyr whatever became of the smallhearted giant glew can achren really be trusted in caer dallben and of course the secret of tarans parentage readers who have been asking me these questions will see why i could not until now answer them fully without spoiling the surprises as for prydain itself part wales as it is but more as it never was at first i thought it a small land existing only in my imagination since then for me it has become much larger while it grew from welsh legend it has broadened into my attempt to make a land of fantasy relevant to a world of reality the first friends of the companions are as steadfast today as they were at the beginning many i thought were new have turned out to have been old friends all along i owe all of them considerably more than they may suspect and as always i offer these pages to them fondly hoping they will find the result not too far below the promise if time has tried their patience with me it has only deepened my affection for them la chapter homecomings under a chill gray sky two riders jogged across the turf taran the taller horseman set his face against wind and leaned forward in the saddle his eyes on the distant hills at his belt hung a sword and from his shoulder a silverbound battle horn his companion gurgi shaggier than the pony he rode pulled his weathered cloak around him rubbed his frostnipped ears and began groaning so wretchedly that taran at last reined up the stallion no no gurgi cried faithful gurgi will keep on he follows kindly master oh yes as he has always done never mind his shakings and achings never mind the droopings of his poor tender head taran smiled seeing that gurgi despite his bold words was eyeing a sheltering grove of ash trees there is time to spare he answered i long to be home but not at the cost of that poor tender head of yours we camp here and go no farther until morning they tethered their mounts and built a small fire in a ring of stones gurgi curled up and was snoring almost before he had finished swallowing his food though as weary as his companion taran set about mending the harness leathers suddlenly he stopped and jumped to his feet overhead a winged shape plunged swiftly toward him look taran cried as gurgi still heavy with sleep sat up and blinked its kaw dallben must have sent him to find us the crow beat his wings clacked his beak and began squawking loudly even before he landed on tarans outstretched wrist eilonwy kaw croaked at the top of his voice eilonwy princess home tarans weariness fell from him like a cloak gurgi wide awake and shouting joyfully scurried to unloose the steeds taran leaped astride melynlas spun the gray stallion about and galloped from the grove with kaw perched on his shoulder and gurgi and the pony pounding at his heels day and night they rode hardly halting for a mouthful of food or a moment of sleep urging all speed and strength from their mounts and from themselves ever southward down from the mountain valley and across great avren until on a bright morning the fields of caer dallben lay before them once again from the instant taran set foot across the threshold such a commotion filled the cottage that he scarcely knew which way to turn kaw had immediately begun jabbering and flapping his wings coll whose great bald crown and broad face shone with delight was clapping taran on the back while gurgi shouted in glee and leaped up and down in a cloud of shedding hair even the ancient enchanter dallben who seldom let anything disturb his meditations hobbled out of his chamber to observe the welcomings in the midst of it all taran could hardly glimpse eilonwy though he heard the voice of the princess very clearly above the din taran of caer dallben she cried as he strove to draw near her ive been waiting to see you for days after all the time ive been away learning to be a young lady as if i werent one before i left when im home at last youre not even here in another moment he was at her side the slender princess still wore at her throat the crescent moon of silver and on her finger the ring crafted by the fair folk but now a band of gold circled her brow and the richness of her apparel made taran suddenly aware of his travelstained cloak and muddy boots and if you think living in a castle is pleasant eilonwy went on without a pause for breath i can tell you it isnt its weary and dreary theyve made me sleep in beds with goosefeather pillows enough to stifle you im sure the geese needed them more than i did the feathers that is not the pillows and servitors to bring you exactly what you dont want to eat and washing your hair whether it needs it or not and sewing and weaving and curtsying and all such i dont even want to think about ive not drawn a sword for i dont know how long eilonwy stopped abruptly and looked curiously at taran thats odd she said theres something different about you its not your hair though it does look as if youd cropped it yourself with your eyes shut its well i cant quite say i mean unless you told someone theyd never guess you were an assistant pigkeeper taran laughed fondly at eilonwys puzzled frown alas its been long since last i tended hen wen indeed when we journeyed among the folk of the free commots gurgi and i toiled at nearly everything but pigkeeping this cloak i wove at the loom of dwyvach the weaverwoman this sword hevydd the smith taught me the forging of it and this he said with a trace of sadness drawing an earthen bowl from his jacket such as it is i made at the wheel of annlaw clayshaper he put the bowl in her hands if it pleases you it is yours its lovely answered eilonwy yes i shall treasure it but thats what i mean too im not saying you arent a good assistant pigkeeper because im sure youre the best in prydain but theres something more you speak truth princess put in coll he left us a pigkeeper and comes back looking as if he could do all he set his hand to whatever taran shook his head i learned i was neither swordsmith nor weaver nor alas a shaper of clay gurgi and i were already homeward bound when kaw found us and here shall we stay im glad of that replied eilonwy all anyone knew about you was that you were wandering every which where dallben told me you were seeking your parents then you met someone you thought was your father but wasnt or was it the other way round i didnt altogether understand it there is little to understand taran said what i sought i found though it was not what i had hoped no it was not murmured dallben who had been watching taran closely you found more than you sought and gained perhaps more than you know i still dont see why you wanted to leave caer dallben eilonwy began taran had no chance to reply for now his hand was seized and shaken vigorously hullo hullo cried a young man with pale blue eyes and strawcolored hair his handsomely embroidered cloak looked as though it had been watersoaked then wrong out to dry his bootlacings broken in several places had been retied in large straggling knots prince rhun taran had almost failed to recognize him rhun had grown taller and leaner though his grin was as broad as it had ever been king rhun actually the young man answered since my father died last summer thats one of the reasons why princess eilonwy is here now my mother wanted to keep her with us on mona to finish her education and you know my mother shed never have left off with it even though dallben had sent word eilonwy was to come home and so he proudly added i finally put my foot down i ordered a ship fitted out and off we sailed from mona haven amazing what a king can do when he sets his mind to it weve brought someone else along too rhun continued gesturing toward the fireside where taran for the first time noticed a pudgy little man sitting with a cookpot between his knees the stranger licked his fingers and wrinkled a flabby nose at taran he made no attempt to rise but only nodded curtly while the scraggly fringe of hair around his bulbous head stirred like weeds under water taran stared not believing what he saw the little man drew himself up and sniffed with a mixture of haughtiness arid wounded feelings one should have no trouble remembering a giant he said testily remember you replied taran how could i not the cavern on mona last time i saw you though you were bigger to say the least but it is you nevertheless it is indeed glew when i was a giant glew said few would have forgotten me so quickly unfortunate that things worked out as they did now in the cavern youve started him off again eilonwy whispered to taran hell go on like that until youre fairly wilted about the glorious days when he used to be a giant hell only stop talking to eat and only stop eating to talk i can understand his eating since he lived on nothing but mushrooms for so long but he must have been wretched as a giant and youd think hed want to forget it i knew dallben sent kaw with a potion to shrink glew back to size taran answered of what happened to him since then ive had no word thats what happened to him said eilonwy as soon as he got free of the cavern he made his way to rhuns castle no one had the heart to turn him away though he bored us all to tears with those endless pointless tales of his we took him with us when we sailed thinking hed be grateful to dallben and want to thank him properly not a bit of it we almost had to twist his ears to get him aboard now that hes here i wish wed left him where he was but three of our companions are missing taran said glancing around the cottage good old doli and fflewddur fflam and i had hoped prince gwydion might have come to welcome eilonwy doli sends his best wishes said coll but we shall have to do without his company our dwarf friend is harder to root out of the fair folk realm than a stump out of a field hell not budge as for fflewddur fflam nothing can keep him and his harp from any merrymaking whatever he should have been here long since prince gwydion as well dallben added he and i have matters to discuss though you young people may doubt it some of them are even weightier than the homecomings of a princess and an assistant pigkeeper well i shall put this on again when fflewddur and prince gwydion arrive said eilonwy taking the golden circlet from her brow just so they can see how it looks but i wont wear it a moment longer its rubbed a blister and it makes my head ache like someone squeezing your neck only higher up ah princess dallben said with a furrowed smile a crown is more discomfort than adornment if you have learned that you have already learned much learning eilonwy declared ive been up to my ears in learning it doesnt show so its hard to believe its there wait thats not quite true either here ive learned this from her cloak she drew a large square of folded cloth and almost shyly handed it to taran i embroidered it for you its not finished yet but i wanted you to have it even so though i admit its not as handsome as the things youve made taran spread out the fabric as broad as his outstretched arms the somewhat stragglethreaded embroidery showed a white blueeyed pig against a field of green its meant to be hen wen eilonwy explained as rhun and gurgi pressed forward to study the handiwork more closely at first i tried to embroider you into it too eilonwy said to taran because youre so fond of hen and because because i was thinking of you but you came out looking like sticks with a birds nest on top not yourself at all so i had to start over with hen alone youll just have to make believe youre standing beside her a little to the left otherwise id never have got this much done and i did work the summer on it if i was in your thoughts then taran said your work gladdens me all the more no matter that hens eyes are really brown eilonwy looked at him in sudden dismay you dont like it i do in all truth taran assured her brown or blue makes no difference it will be useful useful cried eilonwy usefuls not the point its a keepsake not a horse blanket taran of caer dallben you dont understand anything at all at least taran replied with a goodnatured grin i know the color of hen wens eyes eilonwy tossed her redgold hair and put her chin in the air humph she said and very likely forgotten the color of mine not so princess taran answered quietly nor have i forgotten when you gave me this he added taking up the battle horn its powers were greater than either of us knew they are gone now but i treasure it still because it came from your hands you asked why i sought to know my parentage taran went on because i hoped it would prove noble and give me the right to ask what i dared not ask before my hope was mistaken yet even without it taran hesitated searching for the most fitting words before he could speak again the cottage door burst open and taran cried out in alarm at the threshold stood fflewddur fflam the bards face was ashen his ragged yellow hair dung to his forehead on his shoulder he bore the limp body of a man taran with rhun behind him sprang to help gurgi and eilonwy followed as they lowered the still figure to the ground glew his pudgy cheeks quivering stared speechless at the first instant taran had nearly staggered at the shock now his hands worked quickly almost of themselves to unclasp the cloak and loosen the torn jacket before him on the hardpacked earth lay gwydion prince of don blood crusted the warriors wolfgray hair and stained his weathered face his lips were drawn back his teeth set in battle rage gwydions cloak muffled one arm as though at the last he had sought to defend himself with this alone lord gwydion is slain eilonwy cried he lives though barely taran said fetch medicines he ordered gurgi the healing herbs from my saddlebags he stopped short and turned to dallben forgive me it is not for me to command under my masters roof but the herbs are of great power adaon son of taliesin gave them to me long ago they are yours if you wish them i know their nature and have none that will serve better dallben answered nor should you fear to command under any roof since you have learned to command yourself i trust your skill as i see you trust it do as you see fit coll was already hurrying from the scullery with water in a basin dallben who had knelt at gwydions side rose and turned to the bard what evil deed is this the old enchanter spoke hardly above a whisper yet his voice rang through the cottage and his eyes blazed in anger whose hand dared strike him the huntsmen of annuvin replied fflewddur two lives they almost claimed how did you fare he urgently asked taran how did you outride them so quickly be thankful it went no worse for you taran puzzled glanced up at the distraught bard your words have no meaning fflewddur meaning answered the bard they mean what they say gwydion would have traded his life for yours when the huntsmen set upon you not an hour ago set upon me tarans perplexity grew how can that be gurgi and i saw no huntsmen and we have been at caer dallben this hour past great belin a fflam sees what he sees cried fflewddur a fever is working in you taran said you too may be wounded more grievously than you know rest easy we shall give you all the help we can he turned again to gwydion opened the packet of herbs which gurgi had brought and set them to steep in the basin dallbens face was clouded let the bard speak he said there is much in his words that troubles me lord gwydion and i rode together from the northern lands fflewddur began wed crossed avren and were well on our way here a little distance ahead of us in a clearing the bard paused and looked directly at taran i saw you with my own eyes you were hard pressed you shouted to us for help and waved us onward gwydion outdistanced me fflewddur went on youd already galloped beyond the clearing gwydion rode after you like the wind llyan carried me swiftly but by the time i caught up there was no sign of you at all yet huntsmen aplenty they had dragged gwydion from his saddle they would have paid with their own lives had they stood against me cried fflewddur but they fled when i rode up gwydion was close to death and i dared not leave him fflewddur bowed his head his hurt was beyond my skill to treat i could do no more than bring him here as you see him you saved his life my friend taran said and lost what gwydion would have given his life to keep cried the bard the huntsmen failed to slay him but a greater evil has befallen him theyve stripped him of his sword blade and scabbard taran caught his breath concerned only for his companions wounds he had not seen that dyrnwyn the black sword hung no longer at gwydions side terror filled him dyrnwyn the enchanted blade the flaming weapon of ancient power was in the huntsmens hands they would bear it to their master to arawn deathlord in the dark realm of annuvin fflewddur sank to the ground and put his head in his hands and my own wits are lost since you tell me it was not yourself who called out to us what you saw i can not judge taran said gwydions life is our first care we will talk of these things when your memory is clearer the harpers memory is clear enough a blackrobed woman moved from the dark corner where she had been silently listening and stepped slowly into the midst of the company her long unbound hair glittered like pale silver the deadly beauty of her face had not altogether vanished though now it seemed shadowy worn away lingering as a dream only halfrecalled ill fortune mars our meeting assistant pigkeeper achren said but welcome nonetheless what then do you still fear me she added seeing tarans uneasy glance she smiled her teeth were sharp neither has eilonwy daughter of angharad forgotten my powers though it was she who destroyed them at the castle of llyr yet since i have dwelt here have i not served dallben as well as any of you achren strode to the outstretched form of gwydion taran saw a look almost of pity in her cold eyes lord gwydion will live she said but he may find life a crueler fate than death she bent and with her fingertips lightly touched the warriors brow then drew her hand away and faced the bard your eyes did not play you false harper achren said you saw what was meant fo you to see a pigkeeper why not if thus he chose to appear only one wields such a power arawn himself lord of annuvin land of the dead chapter the letter sticks taran could not stifle a gasp of fear the black robed woman glanced at him coldly arawn dares not pass the borders of annuvin in his true form achren said to do so would mean his death but he commands all shapes and they are both shield and mask to the harper and lord gwydion he showed himself as a pigkeeper he could as well have appeared as a fox in the forest an eagle even a blind worm if he deemed that would best serve his ends yes pigkeeper with no less ease could he have chosen the form and features of any creature living for lord gwydion what better lure than the sight of a companion in danger one who had fought often at his side known to him and trusted gwydion is too shrewd a warrior to be taken in a weaker snare then all of us are lost taran said dismayed the lord of annuvin can move among us as he pleases and we are without defense against him you have reason to fear pigkeeper replied achren now you glimpse one of arawns subtlest powers but it is a power used only when none other will serve him never will he leave his stronghold save in the press of mortal danger or as today when what he sought to gain far outweighed the risk achrens voice lowered arawn has many secrets but this one is most deeply guarded once he assumes a shape his strength and skill are no greater than that of the guise he wears then can he be slain like any mortal thing oh fflewddur if id only been with you eilonwy cried in despair arawn wouldnt have deceived me no matter how much he looked like taran dont tell me i couldnt have told the difference between a real assistant pigkeeper and a false one foolish pride daughter of angharad achren answered scornfully no eyes can see behind the mask of arawn deathlord no eyes she added but mine do you doubt me achren went on quickly seeing eilonwys surprise the womans ravaged features held shreds of an old pride and her voice sharpened with haughtiness and anger long before the sons of don came to dwell in prydain long before the lords of the cantrevs swore allegiance to math high king and gwydion his war leader it was i who commanded obedience to my rule i who wore the iron crown of annuvin arawn was my consort who served me and did my bidding achren said and he betrayed me her voice was low and harsh and rage glittered in her eyes he robbed me of my throne and cast me aside yet his powers are no secret to me for it was i who taught them to him let him cloud your sight with whatever guise he chooses from me never can the face of arawn be hidden gwydion stirred and groaned faintly taran turned again to the basin of healing herbs while eilonwy raised the warriors head bear prince gwydion to my chamber dallben ordered the enchanters careworn face was drawn and the lines had deepened in his withered cheeks your skill has helped keep him from death he said to taran now i must see if mine may help him to life coll lifted gwydion in his burly arms achren made to follow after him i have little need of sleep and can best keep a vigil achren said i shall watch the night over lord gwydion i shall watch over him eilonwy said stepping to the side of coll fear me not daughter of angharad achren said i bear no ill will against lord gwydion she bowed deeply halfhumble and halfmocking the stable is my castle and the scullery my realm i seek no other come dallben said both of you shall help me wait the others be patient and hopeful darkness had blinded the windows of the cottage to taran it seemed the fire had lost its warmth and cast only cold shadows among the silent companions at first i thought somehow we could overtake the huntsmen and keep them from reaching annuvin taran said at last but if achren speaks truth arawn himself commanded them and gwydions sword is already in his hands i do not know his purpose but i am deeply afraid i cant forgive myself fflewddur said the loss is my fault i should have seen the trap instantly taran shook his head arawn worked a bitter ruse on you gwydion himself was deceived but not i cried the bard a fflam is keeneyed from the first moment i saw differences the way he sat his steed the way the harp slung at the bards shoulder tensed suddenly and a string snapped with such a twang that gurgi crouched near the hearth started bolt upright fflewddur choked and swallowed there it goes again he muttered will it never leave off the slightest ah coloring of the facts and the beastly strings break believe me i meant no exaggeration as i thought back it did seem that i could notice no the truth of it is the guise was perfect i could be snared again and as easily amazing murmured the king of mona who had been watching wideeyed i say i wish i could do that sort of shapechanging myself unbelievable ive always thought how interesting to be a badger or an ant i should love to know how to build as well as they do since ive been king ive tried to improve things here and there i mean to put up a new seawall at mona haven ive begun once already my idea was to start from both ends at the same time and thus be done twice as quickly i cant understand what went wrong for i took charge of all the work myself but somehow we didnt meet in the middle and ill have to find a better way of going at it then ive planned a road to glews old cavern its an amazing place and i think the folk of dinas rhydnant will enjoy visiting it surprising how easy it is rhun said beaming proudly the planning at any rate the doing for some reason always seems a little harder glew hearing his name spoken pricked up his ears he had not left his place in the chimney corner nor had his alarm at the happenings in the cottage made him loosen his hold on the cookpot when i was a giant he began i see the little weasel is with you said fflewddur to king rhun recognizing glew immediately despite the former giants present stature when he was a giant the bard muttered giving glew a look of illconcealed vexation he was a paltry one hed have done anything to be free of that cavern even to popping us into that foul stew hed cooked up a fflam is forgiving but i think he went a little too far when i was a giant glew continued either ignoring or not hearing the bards remarks no one would have humiliated me by taking me by the ears and hustling me aboard a smelly boat i had no wish to come here after whats happened today i have less wish to stay glew pursed his lips dallben shall see that im taken back to mona without delay im sure he will taran replied but dallben has graver concerns now and so do we all mumbling something about shabby treatment and lack of consideration glew scraped a finger along the bottom of the pot and sucked his teeth with indignant satisfaction the companions said no more but settled down to wait out the night the fire burned to ashes a night wind rose outside the cottage taran rested his head on his arms at this homecoming he had longed to stand before eilonwy forgetting rank and birth as any man before any woman and ask her to wed but now the disaster that had overtaken gwydion made tarans own wishes unimportant though he still did not know eilonwys heart nor what her answer to him might be he could not bring himself to learn it until all hearts were at peace again he closed his eyes the wind screamed as if it would rip to tatters the quiet meadows and orchards of caer dallben a hand on his shoulder aroused him it was eilonwy gwydion has wakened she said he would speak with us in dallbens chamber the prince of don halfraised himself from the couch his features were pale under their weathering and tightly drawn though more in anger than pain his mouth was set bitter his green eyes burned with dark flashes and his glance was that of a proud wolf scornful of his hurt and scornful all the more of those who had given him his wounds achren was a silent shadow in the corner the old enchanter stood anxiously beside the bookstrewn table near the wooden bench where taran throughout boyhood had sat for lessons the book of three the huge leatherbound tome of secret lore forbidden to all but dallben himself lay closed atop a pile of other ancient volumes taran with eilonwy fflewddur and king rhun behind him strode to gwydion and clasped the warriors hand the prince of don smiled grimly no merry meeting and no long one assistant pigkeeper gwydion said dallben has told me of the deathlords ruse dyrnwyn must be regained at all cost and without delay he spoke too of your wanderings gwydion added i would hear more of them from yourself but that must wait another time i ride to annuvin before the day is out taran looked at the prince of don in surprise and concern your wounds are still fresh you can not make such a journey neither can i stay here gwydion answered since dyrnwyn first came into my hands i have learned more of its nature only a little more he added but enough to know its loss is fatal dyrnwyns lineage lies beyond memory of living man gwydion continued and much of its history has been forgotten or destroyed for long the blade was thought no more than legend and matter for a harpers song taliesin chief bard is wisest in the lore of prydain but even he could tell me only that govannion the lame a master craftsman forged and tempered dyrnwyn at the behest of king rhydderch hael as a weapon of greatest power and protection for the land to safeguard it a spell was cast upon the blade and a warning graven on the scabbard i remember the old writing eilonwy said indeed i shall never forget it for i had an impossible time keeping taran from meddling with things he didnt understand draw dyrnwyn only thou of royal blood closer to its true meaning is noble worth said gwydion the enchantment forbade the sword to all but those who would use it wisely and well the flame of dyrnwyn would destroy any other who sought to draw it but the writing on the scabbard has been marred the full message which might have told more of the swords purpose is unknown king rhydderch bore the blade throughout his life gwydion continued and his sons after him their reigns were peaceful and prosperous but here dyrnwyns history ends king rhitta grandson of rhydderch was the last to hold the blade he was lord of spiral castle before it became the stronghold of queen achren he met his death in a way unknown with dyrnwyn clutched in his hands from that time on the sword was seen no more forgotten as it lay buried with him in spiral castles deepest chamber gwydion turned to eilonwy where you princess found it you gave it to me willingly but it was not willingly that it left my hands the blade is worth more than my life or the lives of any of us in arawns grasp it can bring doom upon prydain do you believe arawn can unsheathe the sword taran asked hurriedlycan he turn the weapon against us can he make it serve some evil end this i do not know replied gwydion the warriors face was troubled it may be that arawn deathlord has found means to break the enchantment or unable to use it himself his purpose may be to keep the blade from any other use he would have taken my life as well as the sword thanks to fflewddur fflam i still have the one now i must find the other though the path lead me to the depths of annuvin itself achren silent until now raised her head and spoke to gwydion let me seek dyrnwyn in your stead i know the ways of annuvin no stranger am i to its secret hoards and where and how they are guarded if the sword is hidden i will find it if arawn himself bears it dyrnwyn will be taken from him more than that i swear by every oath to destroy him thus have i sworn already to myself and swear it again to you you forced life upon me gwydion when i begged for death now give me what i live for give me my vengeance gwydion did not answer immediately his greenflecked eyes searched the womans face he said vengeance is not a gift i may bestow achren achren stiffened her hands twisted into claws and taran feared she would fling herself upon gwydion she did not move you will not trust me achren said hoarsely her bloodless lips turned in a smile of contempt so be it prince of don once you scorned to share a kingdom with me scorn me again to your own loss i do not scorn you gwydion said i only urge you to accept dallbens protection stay here in safety among all of us your hope of finding the sword is the least arawns hatred of you can be no less than yours of him he or his servants would slay you at sight even before you set foot in annuvin no achren what you offer is not possible he thought a moment there may be another way to learn how dyrnwyn shall be found gwydion turned to dallben but the enchanter sorrowfully shook his head alas dallben said the book of three can not tell us what we most need to know i have searched carefully every page to understand its hidden meanings they are dark even to me fetch the letter sticks the enchanter said to coll hen wen alone can help us from her enclosure the white pig watched the silent procession on his bony shoulders dallben bore the letter sticks the ashwood rods carved with ancient symbols glew interested only in the provisions of the scullery remained behind as did gurgi who well remembered the former giant and chose to keep an eye on him achren had spoken no further but hooded her face and sat motionless in the cottage usually at the sight of taran the oracular pig would squeal joyously and trot to the railing to have her chin scratched now she cowered in a far corner of the pen her little eyes wide and her cheeks trembling as dallben entered the enclosure and planted the letter sticks upright in the earth hen wen snuffled and crouched closer against the bars dallben murmuring inaudibly moved to stand beside the ashwood rods outside the enclosure the companions waited hen wen whimpered and did not stir what does she fear eilonwy whispered taran made no answer his eyes were fixed on the aged enchanter in his windwhipped robe on the letter sticks and the unmoving form of hen wen against the dull sky they seemed to him frozen together in their own moment far beyond the silent watchers this was the first time taran had seen the enchanter seek a prophecy from the oracular pig of dallbens powers he could only guess but he knew hen wen and knew she was too terrified to move he waited what felt an age even rhun sensed something amiss the king of monas cheerful face was darkly clouded dallben glanced uneasily at gwydion never before has hen wen refused to answer when the letter sticks were shown her again he murmured words taran could not distinguish the oracular pig shuddered violently shut her eyes and sank her head between her stubby trotters perhaps a few notes on my harp fflewddur suggested ive had excellent success the enchanter motioned the bard to be silent once more he spoke softly yet commandingly hen wen shrank into herself and moaned as though in pain her fear blinds her powers dallben said gravely even my spells do not reach her i have failed despair filled the faces of the watching companions gwydion bowed his head and his eyes were deeply troubled we too shall fail he said if we do not learn whatever she can tell us quickly and without a word taran climbed the railing walked steadily toward the frightened pig and dropped to his knees beside her he scratched her chin and gently stroked her neck dont be afraid hen nothing will harm you here dallben surprised started forward then halted hearing tarans voice the pig had cautiously opened one eye her snout twitched she raised her head slightly and gave a faint hwoinch hen listen to me taran pleaded i have no power to command you but we need your help all of us who love you taran spoke on as he did the oracular pig ceased her trembling though she did not attempt to rise hen wen grunted fondly wheezed and made affectionate muttering sounds in her throat she blinked her eyes and her wide face seemed nearly to grin tell us hen taran urged please tell us what you can hen wen moved uneasily slowly she climbed to her feet the white pig snorted and glanced at the letter sticks step by step on her short legs she moved closer to them the enchanter nodded to taran well done he murmured this day the power of an assistant pigkeeper is greater than my own as taran stared not daring to speak hen wen paused at the first rod still hesitant she pointed with her snout at one of the carved symbols then at another dallben watching intently quickly wrote on a scrap of parchment the signs the oracular pig had indicated hen wen continued a few moments then suddenly left off and backed anxiously from the stick dallbens face was grave can this be so he murmured his voice filled with alarm no no we must learn more than that he glanced at taran please hen taran whispered coming to the side of the pig who had begun to shudder again help us despite his words taran feared hen wen would turn away she shook her head squinted her eyes and grunted piteously nevertheless at his pleading she cautiously trotted to the second rod there in desperate haste as if to make an end of it quickly she pointed to other symbols the enchanters hand trembled as he wrote now the third one he said urgently hen wen stifflegged reared back and sank to her haunches all of tarans soothing words would not budge her for several moments at last however she rose and more fearfully than ever trotted to the final ashwood rod even as hen wen approached and before she could point to the first letter the ashwood rods shook and swayed like living things they twisted as though to uproot themselves and with a sound that ripped the air like a thunder clap they split shattered and fell to earth in splinters hen wen squealing in terror flung herself backwards and fled to a corner of the enclosure as taran hurried to her dallben bent picked up the fragments of wood and studied them hopelessly they are destroyed beyond repair and useless now dallben said in a heavy voice the cause is dark to me and hen wens prophecy remains unfinished even so i doubt its end could bode less ill than its beginning she must have sensed this herself the enchanter turned and walked slowly from the enclosure eilonwy had joined taran who strove to calm the terrified pig hen wen still gasped and shook and pressed her head between her forelegs no wonder she didnt want to prophesy eilonwy cried and yet she added to taran hen would have told nothing at all if it hadnt been for you dallben with the parchment in his hand had gone to the side of gwydion coll fflewddur and king rhun gathered anxiously around them sure that hen wen was unharmed and wanted only to be left in peace taran and eilonwy hurried to the companions help oh help yelling waving his arms frantically gurgi raced across the turf he dashed into their midst and pointed toward the stables gurgi could do nothing he cried he tried oh yes but there were only smackings and whackings for his poor tender head gone gurgi shouted with fast and speedful gallopings wicked queen is gone chapter the prophecy the companions hastened to the stable as gurgi had told them one of king rhuns horses was missing of achren there was no trace let me saddle melynlas taran urged gwydion i shall try to overtake her shes going straight to annuvin burst out fflewddur i never trusted that woman great belin who knows what treachery she plans shes off to feather her own nest you can be sure of it achren goes more likely to her death answered gwydion his face grim as he looked toward the hills and the leafless trees there is no safety for her beyond caer dallben i would protect her but dare not delay my quest to seek her now he turned to dallben i must know hen wens prophecy it is my only guide the enchanter nodded and led the companions to the cottage the aged man still held the parchment and the splintered letter sticks now he cast them on the table and gazed at them for a long moment before he spoke hen wen has told us what she can all i fear that we shall ever learn from her i have again studied the symbols she pointed out hoping against hope i had misread them his expression was withdrawn his eyes lowered and he spoke with difficulty as if each word wrenched his heart i asked how dyrnwyn might be recovered hear the answer given us ask sooner mute stone and voiceless rock to speak such is hen wens message as i have read it from the first letter stick dallben said whether it is a refusal to speak a prophecy in itself or a warning to ask no further i can not be sure but the symbols of the second letter stick spell out the fate of dyrnwyn itself dallben continued and the enchanters words filled taran with cold anguish that struck deep as a sword thrust quenched will be dyrnwyns flame vanished its power night turn to noon and rivers burn with frozen fire ere dyrnwyn be regained the ancient man bowed his head then and was silent for a time the third stick he said at last was destroyed before hen wen could complete her message she might have told us more but judging from the first two we would have cause for no more hope than we have now the prophecies mock us taran said hen told us truly we could as well have asked stones for help and got as much sense from them cried eilonwy hen could have come straight out and said well never get dyrnwyn back night cant be noon and thats the end of it in all my travels added fflewddur ive never noticed even a small creek burning not to mention a river the prophecy is doubly impossible and yet said king rhun with innocent eagerness it would be an amazing thing to see i wish it could happen i fear you shall not see it come to pass king of mona dallben said heavily gwydion who had been sitting thoughtfully at the table and turning the splintered rods back and forth in his hands rose and spoke to the companions hen wens prophecy is disheartening he said and far from what i had hoped but when prophecies give no help men must find it of themselves his hands clenched and snapped the fragment of ash wood as long as life and breath are mine i will seek dyrnwyn the prophecy does not change my plans but makes them only more urgent then let us go with you taran said rising to face gwydion take our strength until your own returns exactly so fflewddur jumped to his feet ill pay no heed whether rivers burn or not ask stones to speak ill ask arawn himself hell keep no secrets from a fflam gwydion shook his head in this task the more men the greater risk it is done best alone if any life be staked against arawn deathlord it must be mine taran bowed for gwydions tone forbade dispute if such is your will he said but what if kaw were to fly ahead to annuvin send him first he will go swiftly and bring back whatever knowledge he can gain gwydion looked shrewdly at taran and nodded approval you have found some wisdom in your wanderings assistant pigkeeper your plan is sound kaw may serve me better than all your swords but i shall not await him here to do so would cost me too much time let him spy out annuvin as far as he is able then find me at king smoits castle in cantrev cadiffor smoits realm lies on my path to annuvin and thus my journey will be half accomplished when kaw rejoins me at least we can ride with you as far as king smoits castle taran said and guard you until you are well on your way between here and cantrev cadiffor arawns huntsmen may be abroad still seeking your death the foul villains cried the bard treacherous murderers theyll have a taste of my sword this time let them attack us i hope they do a harp string snapped with a loud crack that set the instrument ajangling ah yes well thats only a manner of speaking fflewddur said sheepishly i hope we dont come upon them at all they could be troublesome and delay our journey no one has considered the inconvenience to me said glew the former giant had come out of the scullery and looked peevishly around him weasel muttered fflewddur dyrnwyn is gone we dont know if our lives are at stake and he frets about inconvenience hes a little man indeed and always was since no one has mentioned it said eilonwy it seems im not being asked to come along very well i shant insist you too have gained wisdom princess said dallben your days on mona were not illspent of course eilonwy went on after you leave the thought may strike me that its a pleasant day for a short ride to go picking wildflowers which might be hard to find especially since its almost winter not that id be following you you understand but i might by accident lose my way and mistakenly happen to catch up with you by then it would be too late for me to come home through no fault of my own gwydions haggard face broke into a smile so be it princess what i can not prevent i accept ride with me all those who choose but no farther than smoits stronghold at caer cadarn ah princess coll sighed shaking his head i will not gainsay lord gwydion whatever but it is hardly the conduct of a young lady to force her own way thus certainly not eilonwy agreed thats the first thing queen teleria taught me a lady doesnt insist on having her own way then next thing you know it all works out somehow without ones even trying i thought id never learn though its really quite easy once you get the knack without further delay taran lifted kaw from his fireside perch and carried him to the dooryard this time the crow did not clack his beak or gabble impudently instead of his customary scoldings hoarse quackings and mischievous foolery kaw hunched on tarans wrist and cocked a beady attentive eye listening closely while taran carefully explained the task taran raised his arm and kaw flapped his glossy wings in farewell annuvin kaw croaked dyrnwyn the crow flew aloft within moments kaw was high over caer dallben the wind bore him like a leaf and he hung poised above the watching companions then with a roguish flirt of his wings kaw sped northwestward taran strained his eyes to follow his flight until the crow vanished into the looming clouds in sadness and disquiet taran at last turned away kaw he was sure would be alert to the perils of the journey the arrows of the huntsmen the cruel talons and slashing beaks of the gwythaints arawns fierce winged messengers more than once had gwythaints attacked the companions and even the fledglings could be dangerous taran recalled from his boyhood the young gwythaint whose life he had saved and he well remembered the birds sharp claws despite kaws gallant heart and sharp wits taran feared for the safety of the crow and feared still more for gwydions quest and to him came the foreboding that an even heavier fate might ride on kaws outspread wings it had been agreed that when the travelers neared great avren king rhun would escort the disgruntled glew to the ship anchored in the river there to await his return for rhun was determined to ride with gwydion to caer cadarn glew liked neither cooling his heels on the swaying vessel nor sleeping on the hard pebbles of the shore but the protests of the former giant could not move the king of mona to change his plan while gwydion held a last hurried council with dallben the companions began leading the horses from the stable the wise melyngar gwydions white goldenmaned steed waited calmly for her master melynlas tarans stallion snorted and impatiently pawed the ground eilonwy was already mounted on her favorite the bay mare lluagor in a fold of her cloak the princess carried her most treasured possession the golden sphere that glowed brightly when she cupped it in her hands im leaving that uncomfortable crown behind eilonwy declared theres no use for it at all except to hold down your hair and thats hardly worth the blisters but id sooner walk on my hands than go without my bauble besides if we need a light we shall have one thats much more practical than a hoop on top of your head in a saddlebag she had packed the embroidery made for taran intending to finish it along the way perhaps eilonwy added i might fix the color of hen wens eyes while im at it fflewddurs mount was the huge tawny cat llyan herself tall as a horse seeing the bard she purred loudly and fflewddur could barely keep the powerful animal from knocking him down with her nuzzling gently old girl cried the bard as llyan thrust her great head between his neck and shoulder i know you want a tune on my harp i shall play one later i promise you glew had recognized llyan immediately thats not fair he sniffed by all rights she belongs to me yes replied fflewddur if you count feeding her those vile lotions you once brewed to make her grow bigger if you dare to ride her youre welcome to try though i warn you llyan has a memory longer than her tail llyan indeed had begun lashing her tail at the sight of glew she towered over the pudgy little man her yellow eyes blazed her whiskers twitched her tufted ears went flat against her head and from her throat came a sound quite unlike her greeting to the bard fflewddur quickly strummed a melody on his harp llyan turned her eyes from glew and her mouth curved in an enormous smile and she blinked fondly at the bard however glews pale face had gone paler and he edged away from the cat when i was a giant glew muttered things were considerably better managed king rhun saddled his dapple gray steed since coll who had also decided to accompany gwydion would ride the sorrel mare llamrei foal of melynlas and lluagor glew had no choice but to climb up behind gurgi on his shaggy pony a companionship unwelcome to all three taran meanwhile helped coll rummage in the stables forge and tool sheds for weapons few enough of them there are said coll these spears have served me well as beanpoles the stout warrior added i had hoped never to use them for another purpose alas the only blade i can give gwydion is rusted from propping up one of the apple trees as for helmets there are none save my leather cap and the sparrows have a nest in it i shall not disturb them but my own old pate is tough as leather coll said winking it can last me to caer cadarn and back and you my lad coll went on cheerfully though he had not failed to notice tarans troubled frown i remember a day when an assistant pigkeeper would have been all flash and fire to ride with lord gwydion now you look as glum as a frostbitten turnip taran smiled i myself would ride to annuvin if gwydion allowed me what you say is true old friend for the boy i was this would have been a bold adventure full of glory this much have i learned a mans life weighs more than glory and a price paid in blood is a heavy reckoning my heart is not easy taran added long ago you made your way to annuvin to rescue hen wen after she had been stolen from you tell me what chance has gwydion alone in arawns realm no man has better said coll shouldering the spears and he was gone from the shed before taran realized the old warrior had not really answered him at all caer dallben lay far behind them and the day was darkening when the companions made camp deep in the shadows of the forest eilonwy happily flung herself to the ground its been long since ive slept on comfortable roots and rocks she cried what a pleasant change from goosefeathers gwydion allowed a fire to be built and while coll saw to the mounts gurgi opened his wallet of food to share out provisions for the most part the companions were silent chilled and stiff after the long days journey king rhun however had lost none of his good spirits as the travelers huddled closer to the pale flames rhun picked up a twig and scratched busily in the earth covering the ground before him with a spider web of lines about that seawall said rhun i think i see how it went wrong yes exactly so now heres the way to do it from across the fire taran saw rhuns eyes brightly eager and on his face the familiar boyish grin but rhun taran sensed was no longer the feckless princeling he had known on the isle of mona as rhun was absorbed in the tasks he had planned so taran had been caught up in his own labors at forge loom and potters wheel and if rhun had found manhood in ruling a kingdom taran had found the same in toiling among the staunch folk of the free commots he watched rhun with new affection the king of mona spoke on and tarans interest was drawn to the scratchings on the ground he studied them as rhun continued taran smiled one thing had not changed he realized as usual the king of monas intentions went somewhat beyond the king of monas skill i fear your wall may tumble if you build it thus taran said with a kindly laugh see this part here he pointed the heavier stones must be sunk deeper and here amazing exclaimed rhun snapping his fingers quite right you shall come to mona and help me finish it he began scratching new lines so vigorously he nearly pitched himself into the fire oh great and kindly master cried gurgi who had been listening closely without altogether understanding what the two comrades had been discussing oh clever scannings and plannings gurgi wishes he too had wisdom of wise speakings gwydion warned them to silence our fire is risk enough without adding noise to it i can only hope arawns huntsmen are not abroad we are too few to withstand even a handful of them they are not common warriors gwydion added seeing rhuns questioning expression but an evil brotherhood slay one of their band and the strength of the others grows that much greater taran nodded they are as much to be feared as the cauldronborn he cautioned rhun the deathless voiceless creatures that guard annuvin perhaps more to be feared the cauldronborn can not be slain yet their power dwindles if they journey too far or stay too long beyond arawns realm rhun blinked and gurgi fell silent glancing behind him uncomfortably memory of the ruthless cauldronborn turned tarans thoughts once more to hen wens prophecy the flame of dyrnwyn quenched taran murmured yet how shall arawn achieve this for all his power i will not believe he can even draw the blade prophecy is more than the words that shape it gwydion said seek the meaning that underlies it for us the flame of dyrnwyn will be as good as quenched if arawn keeps it from my hands its power will indeed vanish for all it may avail us should the blade be locked forever in his treasure hoard treasure said glew stopping his munching only long enough to speak the word the deathlords domain is as much a treasurehouse as a stronghold of evil gwydion said long has it been filled with all the fair and useful things arawn has stolen from prydain these treasures do not serve him his purpose is to deprive to keep their use from men to sap our strength by denying us what might yield a richer harvest than any of us here has known gwydion paused is this not death in but another guise i have been told taran said the treasure troves of annuvin hold all that men could wish for plows there are said to be that work of themselves scythes that reap with no hand to guide them magical tools and more taran went on for arawn stole the craft secrets of metalsmiths and potters the lore of herdsmen and farmers this knowledge too lies locked forever in his hoard glew sucked his teeth the morsel of food stayed untouched in his chubby fingers for a long while he said nothing at last he cleared his throat i mean to forgive your slights and humiliations it would not have happened when i was a giant i assure you but no matter i pardon you all in token of my good will i too shall journey with you gwydion looked at him sharply perhaps you shall he said quietly after a time no question of it now fflewddur snorted the little weasel hopes to sniff out something for himself i can see his nose trembling i never thought the day would come when i should want him at our side but i think thats safer than having him at our backs glew smiled blandlyi forgive you too he said chapter king smoits castle at dawn king rhun made ready to part from the companions and ride farther westward to avren harbor where he would advise his shipmaster of the change in plans fflewddur was to accompany him for the bard knew the shallow fording places across the river and the swiftest paths on the opposite bank eilonwy had decided to go with them ive forgotten half my embroidery thread in rhuns ship and must have it if im to finish hen wen properly neither of you can find it for im not sure myself where it might be i believe ive left a warmer traveling cloak too and a few other things i dont remember what they are right now but im bound to think of them once i get there coll grinned and rubbed his bald crown the princess he remarked becomes more the lady in every way since im not staying on the ship said glew whose decision of the night before remained unshaken i see no reason to be taken out of my way i shall follow with lord gwydion that my puny giant is where youre wrong the bard replied mount up behind the king of mona if he can stand your company and be quick about it dont think ill let you out of my sight for a moment where i go you go and the other way around too for the matter of that surely fflewddur taran said drawing the bard aside glew cant trouble us i myself shall watch over him the bard shook his tousled yellow head no my friend ill be easier in my mind if i see him with my own eyes and at all times no the little weasel is in my charge ride on ahead and well catch up with you on the other side of avren well before midday ill be glad to see smoit again fflewddur added that redbearded old bear is dear to my heart we shall feast well at caer cadarn for smoit eats as bravely as he fights gwydion had already mounted melyngar and signaled them to hasten fflewddur clapped taran on the shoulder and ran to climb astride llyan who was frisking gaily in the bright cold sun and pouncing at the tip of her own tail king rhun fflewddur eilonwy and glew soon were out of sight bearing westward taran rode between gwydion and coll while gurgi on his pony trotted at the rear they halted on the far bank of great avren midday passed without a sign of the other companions though taran was anxious about them he preferred to believe they had not come to harm rhun has likely stopped to look at a badger tunnel or anthill he said i hope it is no more than that never fear said coll fflewddur will jog him along theyll be here at any moment taran sounded his horn hoping the signal would guide the bard in case fflewddur had mistaken the path still they did not come gwydion having waited as long as he dared chose to press on to caer cadarn they continued at a brisk pace for the rest of the day taran turned often in his saddle expecting always to glimpse rhun and the other companions galloping up behind them or suddenly to hear the king of monas cheerful hullo hullo however as the day waned taran realized that rhun a slow horseman at best was by now outdistanced fflewddur he was sure would not travel after nightfall they have camped somewhere behind us coll assured taran were aught amiss one of them would have reached us fflewddur fflam knows the way to smoits castle we shall all meet there and if they seem too long delayed smoit will raise a searching party the stout warrior put a hand on tarans shoulder ease your spirit until there is clear cause for alarm or he added with a wink is it the company of princess eilonwy you long for she should not have come with us taran replied half angrily no doubt coll grinned yet you were not the one to speak against her taran grinned back at him as for doing that he said i have given it up long since at midmorning of the following day caer cadarn rose before them and from a stone tower smoits crimson banner with its emblem of a black bear snapped in the wind the stronghold had been built in a clearing and the heavy walls jutted like the bearded kings own brows scarred and pitted by many a battle coll urging llamrei ahead shouted to the guards in the name of gwydion prince of don the massive gates opened and the companions galloped into the courtyard where menatarms tethered the horses and a party of warriors led the way to smoits great hall gwydion strode quickly down the corridor flanked by the guards taran coll and gurgi followed smoit will be at his meat taran said his breakfast lasts till high noon he laughed he says it whets his appetite for the rest of his meals gwydion will get no word out of him until we ourselves are stuffed yes yes gurgi cried gurgi longs for tasty crunchings and munchings you shall have them old friend taran answered be sure of it they entered the great hall at one end stood smoits huge throne cut from half an oak tree and carved in the shape of a bear with paws upraised on either side the man seated there was not king smoit magg taran gasped guards fell upon them instantly tarans sword was ripped from his belt with a great cry gwydion flung himself against the warriors but they pressed about him and bore the prince of don to his knees coll too was borne down and a spear pressed against his back gurgi yelled in rage and terror a guard seized him by the scruff of his shaggy neck buffeting him until the poor creature could barely stagger to his feet magg grinned like a skull with a slight movement of his skinny fingers he gestured the warriors to stand away his gray pinched face twitched with pleasure our meeting lord gwydion is one i did not foresee my warriors hold caer cadarn but this is an added prize and a richer one than i had hoped gwydions green eyes blazed have you dared even to enter king smoits cantrev begone from here before he returns he shall deal with you less gently than i you will join king smoit magg replied though king i scorn to call this rude cantrev lord maggs thin lips curled caressingly he put a hand to his embroidered cloak taran saw that maggs garments were even richer than those the lankhaired man had worn as chief steward to the court of mona more powerful than smoit or the king of mona more powerful than queen achren is my liege lord magg said with a yellow smile and mightier now than the prince of don he touched the iron chain hanging from his neck and fondled the heavy badge of office in horror taran saw it bore the same symbol that was branded on the foreheads of the huntsmen i serve no lesser liege magg said haughtily than the king of annuvin arawn deathlord himself gwydions glance did not falter you have found your true master magg when last we parted lord gwydion said magg i believed you dead it was my joy later to learn that you were not the chief steward licked his lips seldom is one given to savor his revenge twice and i was patient until the day we should meet again patient yes magg hissed long i wandered after i sailed from the isle of mona there were those i served humbly biding my time one sought even to cast me in a dungeon i magg who once held a kingdom in his grasp the voice of the chief steward rose shrilly his face had gone livid and his eyes started from their sockets but in a moment he gained control of his trembling hands and sank back on smoits throne now the words came from his lips as if he were tasting each one at length i made my way to annuvin magg said to the very threshold of dark gate lord arawn did not know me then as he knows me now magg nodded in satisfaction there was much he learned from me lord arawn knew the history of dyrnwyn magg continued he knew it had been lost and found again and that gwydion son of don bore it but it was i magg who told him how best to gain it even your treachery is paltry taran said late or soon with or without you arawn would have struck on that evil scheme himself perhaps magg said slyly perhaps what he learned from me was less than what i learned from him for i soon discovered that his power was dangerously balanced his champion the horned king had long been defeated even the black crochan the cauldron that gave him the deathless cauldronborn was shattered lord arawn has many secret liegemen among the cantrev kings magg went on he has promised them great riches and domains and they are sworn to serve him but his defeats turned them restive it was i who showed him the means to win stronger allegiance it was my plan mine alone that put dyrnwyn in his hands word now spreads throughout the cantrevs that arawn deathlord holds the mightiest weapon in prydain he knows its secrets far better than you do lord gwydion and knows he can not be defeated his liegemen rejoice for they will soon taste victory other warlords will rally to his banner and his host of warriors will grow i magg have wrought this the chief steward cried i magg second only to the deathlord i magg speak in his name i am his trusted emissary and i ride from realm to realm gathering armies to destroy the sons of don and those who give them allegiance all prydain will be his dominion and those who stand against him if lord arawn chooses to be merciful he will slay them his huntsmen will drink their blood the others will grovel in bondage forever maggs eyes gleamed his pale brow glistened and his cheeks quivered violently for this he hissed for this lord arawn has sworn to me by every oath one day i magg will wear the iron crown of annuvin you are as much a fool as a traitor gwydion said in a hard voice and doubly so first to believe arawn then to believe king smoit would heed your serpents words have you slain him only dead would he listen to you smoit lives answered magg i care nothing for his allegiance i seek the fealty of the liegemen in his cantrev smoit shall order them in his name to serve my cause king smoit would sooner have his tongue ripped out taran cried and so perhaps he shall replied magg mute he will serve me as well he will ride with me and i will speak on his behalf better than he would speak on his own yet he mused i would prefer the commands to come from his lips rather than mine there are ways to loosen his tongue instead of cutting it from his head some have already been tried magg narrowed his eyes the best means stand before me now you lord gwydion and you pigkeeper speak with him let smoit see that he must yield to me magg smiled crookedly your lives hang on it the chief steward moved his head slightly the guards stepped forward roughly the companions were prodded from the great hall shock and despair so filled taran that he was hardly aware of the passages they were led down the warriors halted one flung open a heavy door others thrust the companions into a narrow chamber the door grated shut and darkness swallowed them as they groped blindly taran stumbled on a prostrate form that stirred and bellowed loudly my body and blood roared the voice of king smoit and taran was grappled by a pair of bonecracking arms are you come again magg youll not take me alive taran was nearly smothered and crushed before gwydion called out his own name and the names of the companions smoits grip loosened and taran felt a huge hand on his face my pulse and so it is cried smoit as the companions gathered around him the pigkeeper lord gwydion coll id know that bald pate of yours anywhere his hand fell on gurgis disheveled head and the little whateveritis well met my riends smoit groaned heavily and ill met too how has that simpering sop trapped you the lardlipped squirming lackey has snared us all gwydion quickly told smoit what had befallen them the redbearded king growled furiously magg caught me as easily as he did you yesterday i was at breakfast and had barely set myself to my meat when my steward brought tidings that a messenger from lord goryon sought words with me now then i knew goryon was at odds with lord gast a matter of cowstealing as usual ah will the cantrev lords of prydain ever stop their endless bickering however since id heard gasts side of it i deemed i should listen to goryons smoit snorted and struck his massive thigh before i could swallow another mouthful maggs warriors were about me my heart and liver some of them will remember smoit another troop had lain in ambush and stormed through the gate smoit put his head in his hands of my own men those not slain are prisoned in the guardrooms and armories and you taran asked anxiously are you in pain magg spoke of torture pain smoit bellowed so loudly the chamber echoed torture i suffer till i sweat but not at the hands of that longnosed worm my skins thick enough let magg break his teeth on my bones he troubles me no more than a fleabite or bramble scratch why ive taken worse in a friendly scuffle do you speak of pain smoit stormed on by every hair of my beard i swear it pains me more than hot iron to be mewed up in my own castle my own stronghold and a captive in it gulled in my own great hall my own food and drink snatched from my lips and my breakfast ruined torment worse than that its enough to sour a man out of his appetite gwydion and coll meantime had made their way to the walls and as far as the dim light allowed were hastily examining them for any sign of weakness taran now that his eyes had grown a little more used to the gloom feared that his companions were wasting their labors the cell was windowless what little air reached them came only from the tiny heavily barred grating of the door the floor was not of hardpacked earth but of flagstones joined with barely a crack smoit himself realizing the purpose of gwydions efforts shook his head and pounded his ironshod boots on the floor solid as a mountain he cried i know for i built it myself spare yourself pains my friends it will crack no sooner than i how far below ground is this dungeon taran asked though his hope for escape was fading with each moment is there no way we can dig upward dungeon cried smoit ive no more dungeons in caer cadarn when last we met you called my dungeons useless right you were and so i walled them up now theres no wrongdoing in my cantrev that i cant settle quicker and easier with a few words who hears my voice will mend his ways or mend his head dungeon indeed its a spare larder would that i had stocked it as solidly as i built it groaned smoit let magg bring his irons and lashes ill heed them not a bit in the midst of this other fiendish torment the larder lies beside my scullery ive not lined my belly for two days two years it feels the vile traitor has not left off his feasting and for me no more than the sniff of it oh he shall pay for this smoit cried ill beg him one thing only a moment with my paws about his skinny neck ill squeeze out all the puddings and pastries hes ever gobbled gwydion had come to crouch beside the furious smoit your larder may be our tomb he said grimly not only for ourselves he added fflewddur fflam leads our companions here maggs jaws will close on them as tightly as they are closed on us chapter the watcher although fflewddur fflam quickly led eilonwy king rhun and glew to avren harbor their return from the ship was less rapid first the king of mona managed against all likelihood to tumble over his horses neck when the dapple gray halted to drink at the riverbank the ducking thoroughly soaked the unlucky king but did not dampen his spirits however rhuns sword belt had come undone and the blade had sunk in the shallows rhun being unable to fish it out again because he had also got himself tangled in the steeds harness fflewddur was obliged to plunge into the river for the weapon glew now protested bitterly against riding behind the sopping bard walk then little weasel cried fflewddur shivering and beating his arms against his sides by my choice in the opposite direction glew only sniffed haughtily and refused to budge eilonwy stamped her foot with impatience will you make haste all of you we came to look after lord gwydion and we can hardly look after ourselves the former giant consented to ride behind the princess on lluagor and they set out once more llyan however had suddenly taken it into her head to be playful she lunged forward on her huge padded paws and spun joyfully about while the desperate bard clung to her tawny neck it was all fflewddur could do to keep llyan from rolling onto her back with himself astride her she seldom does this shouted the breathless bard while llyan with great leaps circled the companions shes really been quite well behaved no use scolding her makes no difference at last fflewddur was forced with difficulty to unsling his harp and pluck out a melody until llyan grew calm again soon after midday the bard heard the faint distant notes of tarans horn theyre worried over us fflewddur said i hope we shall soon rejoin them the companions pressed on as quickly as they could but the distance between the two bands increased rather than dwindled and at nightfall they wearily halted and slept a fresh morning start brought them according to fflewddurs reckoning less than half a day behind the others king rhun more than ever eager to reach caer cadarn urged all speed from the dapple gray but the mares pace was much slower than llyans and lluagors eilonwy and fflewddur continually had to rein in their mounts midway through the afternoon king rhun gave a glad cry caer cadarn lay only a little distance off they saw smoits crimson banner clearly beyond the trees the companions were about to hasten onward but eilonwy frowned and looked once more at the fluttering standard how odd the princess remarked i see king smoits jolly old bear but gwydion surely must be there by now and i dont see the banner of the house of don queen teleria taught me it is courtesy for a cantrev noble to fly the golden sunburst of don when one of the royal house visits him true enough in ordinary circumstances agreed fflewddur but i doubt at this point that gwydion wants anyone to know where he is hes told smoit to put aside the formalities a most sensible precaution yes of course eilonwy replied i shouldnt have thought of that how clever of you fflewddur the bard beamed happily experience princess long experience but never fear such wisdom will come to you in time even so eilonwy said as they rode farther its curious the gates are closed knowing king smoit you might suppose theyd be flung wide open and a guard of honor waiting for us with king smoit himself ar their head fflewddur waved the girls remark aside not a bit of it lord gwydiom follows a path of danger not a round of festivals i understand how such things are done ive been on a thousand secret missions ah well perhaps one or two he added hastily i fully expected caer cadarn would be buckled bolted and shut tight as an oyster yes eilonwy said im sure you know more about such things than i she hesitated straining her eyes to take in the castle which the companions were now rapidly approaching but king smoit isnt at war with his neighbors as far as ive heard two watchmen on the walls would be more than enough does he need a whole party of bowmen naturally replied fflewddur to protect lord gwydion but if no one is to know gwydions there eilonwy persisted great belin cried the bard reining up llyan now you make my head spin are you trying to say gwydions not at caer cadarn if hes not we shall soon find out and if he is we shall find that out as well fflewddur scratched his spiky yellow head but if hes not then why not what could have happened and if he is then theres nothing to worry about yet if he isnt oh drat and blast youve turned me queasy i dont understand i dont understand either eilonwy answered all i know and i dont even know it is that well i cant explain i i see the castle all crookedwise no not see taste no well no matter she burst out ive come all over chills and creeps and i dont like it youve had experience i dont doubt but my ancestors were enchantresses every one and so should i have been if i hadnt chosen to be a young lady enchantments the bard muttered uncomfortably stay away from them dont meddle its also been my experience they never turn out well i say put in rhun if the princess feels theres something amiss ill be glad to ride ahead and find out i shall frankly rap on the gates and demand to know nonsense replied fflewddur im quite sure all is well a harp string broke and twanged loudly the bard cleared his throat no im not sure at all oh bother it the girl has put an idea in my head and i cant shake it out one way everything looks all right the other way it looks all wrong just to ease your mind ah my mind that is fflewddur told the princess i shall be the one to find out as a wandering bard i can go and come as i please if anythings wrong none will suspect me if not theres no harm done stay here ill be back directly we shall laugh over this at king smoits table he added but without great assurance the bard dismounted considering it wiser not to draw attention by riding llyan and you try no mischief he warned glew i hate to let you out of my sight but llyan will keep an eye on you hers are sharper than mine so are her teeth on foot the bard made his way to the castle after a time eilonwy saw the gates swing open and fflewddur disappear within then all was silent by nightfall the girl had grown seriously alarmed for there had been no further sign from the bard the companions had concealed themselves in a thicket awaiting fflewddurs return but now eilonwy rose and anxiously faced the castle it is all wrong she cried taking an impatient stride forward king rhun drew her back perhaps not he said why hed have come back immediately to warn us if there was no doubt smoits giving him supper or rhun loosened his sword in its sheath ill go and see no you shall not eilonwy cried i should have gone in the first place oh i should have known better than to let myself be put off by anyone rhun however insisted eilonwy refused the heated although whispered dispute that followed was interrupted by the sudden arrival of the bard himself breathless and gasping he stumbled into the thicket its magg he has them all fflewddurs voice was pale as his face in the moonlight caught trapped eilonwy and rhun listened aghast at what fflewddur had learned the warriors themselves dont know who the prisoners are only that there are four with smoit locked up for treachery treachery indeed theyve been made to swallow some kind of tale the game goes deeper than that what it is i couldnt discover i think the guards had orders to lay hold of everybody entering the castle luckily those orders didnt seem to apply to wandering bards its so usual for a bard to drift in and sing for his supper that the warriors never gave it a second thought though a they did keep an eye on me and wouldnt let me near smoits great hall or the larder where theyve put the prisoners but i caught a glimpse of magg oh the sneering smirking spider if only i could have run him through then and there the warriors kept me harping until i thought my fingers would drop off he hurriedly concluded otherwise i should have been back long ago i didnt dare stop or theyd have smelled a rat and theres a rat to be smelled he cried furiously how shall we rescue them eilonwy demanded i dont care why theyre locked up ask later first get them out we cant fflewddur answered in despair impossible not with only four of us and thats four counting glew who cant be counted at all glew snorted usually the little man took no interest in anything not bearing directly on himself now his face was agitated when i was a giant i could have torn the walls down bother when you were a giant snapped fflewddur youre not one now our only hope is to go farther into the cantrev tell one of the cantrev lords whats happened and have him rally an attack force it will take too long cried eilonwy oh do be quiet and let me think the girl strode again to the clearing and turned her eyes defiantly toward the castle which flung its own dark defiance against her her mind raced but with no clear plan with half a sob and half a cry of anger she was about to turn away a movement against a nearby tree caught her glance she halted a moment not daring to turn her head from a corner of her eye she grew aware of a strange humped shadow motionless now as if to continue on her path she walked seemingly in the direction of fflewddur and rhun but edged little by little toward the tree suddenly quick as llyan she leaped upon the humped figure part of it went rolling in one direction and the rest of it set up a muffled shrieking eilonwy pummeled kicked and scratched fflewddur and king rhun were at her side in an instant the bard seized one end of the flailing shape king rhun the other eilonwy drew back and quickly took the bauble from her cloak as she cupped it in her hand the sphere began to glow she held it closer to the struggling form her jaw dropped the golden beams shone on a pale wrinkled face with a long drooping nose and mournful mouth wild wisps of cobweblike hair floated above a pair of eyes that blinked wretchedly and tearfully gwystyl eilonwy cried gwystyl of the fair folk the bard loosened his grasp gwystyl sat up rubbed his skinny arms then climbed to his feet and pulled his cloak defensively about him how nice to see you again he mumbled a pleasure believe me ive thought of you often goodbye now i really must be on my way help us eilonwy pleaded gwystyl we beg you our companions are prisoned in smoits castle gwystyl clapped his hands to his head his face puckered miserably please please he moaned dont shout im not well im not up to being shouted at this evening and would you mind not shining that light in my eyes no no its really too much its more than enough to be pulled down and sat on without people picking at you and bellowing and halfblinding you as i was saying yes its been delightful running into you of course ill be glad to help but perhaps another time when were not feeling so upset gwystyl dont you understand eilonwy cried have you been listening to me at all another time you must help us now gwydions sword is stolen dyrnwyn is gone arawn has it dont you see what that means this is the most terrible thing that could ever happen how can gwydion get the sword back if hes locked up with his own life in danger and taran and coll and gurgi some days are like that gwystyl sighed and whats to be done about it nothing alas but hope things will brighten which they very likely wont but there you are its all one can do yes i know dyrnwyn is stolen a sad misfortune a disheartening state of affairs you already know exclaimed the bard great belin speak up where is it no idea whatever gwystyl gasped in such desperation that eilonwy believed the melancholy creature indeed spoke the truth but thats the least of my concerns whats happening around annuvin he shuddered and patted his pale forehead with a trembling hand the huntsmen are gathering the cauldronborn have come out whole troops of them ive never seen so many cauldronborn altogether in my life its enough to make a decent person take to his bed and thats not the half of it gwystyl choked some of the cantrev lords are rallying their battle hosts and their war leaders hold council in annuvin the place is thick with warriors inside outside wherever you look i was even afraid theyd discover my tunnels and spy holes these days im the fair folks only watcher close to annuvin mores the pity for the work piles up so believe me gwystyl hurried on your friends are better off where they are much safer no matter whats being done to them it cant be worse than stumbling into that hornets nest if by chance you do see them again give them all my fondest greetings im sorry terribly sorry i cant stay longer im on my way to the realm of the fair folk king eiddileg should learn of these matters without delay if king eiddileg learns you wouldnt help us eilonwy indignantly burst out youll wish youd never left your waypost its a long hard journey gwystyl sighed and shook his cobwebby head completely ignoring eilonwys remark i shall have to go above ground every step eiddileg will want to know all thats stirring along the way im not up to journeying not in my condition not in this weather least of all summer would have been much more agreeable but theres nothing to be done about that goodbye farewell always a pleasure gwystyl stooped to pick up a bundle almost as large as himself eilonwy clutched him by the arm oh no you dont she cried youll warn king eiddileg after we free our companions dont try to deceive me gwystyl of the fair folk youre cleverer than you care to let on but if you wont give us your help i know how to get it ill squeeze it out of you the girl made a movement to seize the creature about his neck gwystyl gave a heartrending sob and feebly endeavored to defend himself no squeezing no please i couldnt face up to it not now goodbye really this is hardly the moment fflewddur meanwhile was staring curiously at the bundle the large lumpy pack had rolled near a bush when eilonwy had first set upon gwystyl and it lay partly undone on the ground great belin murmured the bard what a tangle of oddments worse than a snail with his household on his back its nothing nothing at all gwystyl said hurriedly a few little comforts to ease the journey we might do better squeezing this pack instead of gwystyls neck remarked fflewddur who had dropped to his knees and had begun to rummage through the bundle there may be something here more useful than gwystyl himself take whatever you please gwystyl urged as eilonwy turned the baubles glow upon the heap have it all if you like it makes no difference i shall manage without it painfully but i shall manage king rhun knelt beside the bard who thus far had pulled out a few mended sheepskinlined jackets and several ragged cloaks amazing rhun cried heres a birds nest yes gwystyl sighed take it its something ive been saving you never know when the need for one might arise but its yours now no thank you muttered the bard i shouldnt want to deprive you their hasty search next revealed water flasks both empty and full a walking staff in jointed sections allowing it to be folded up a cushion with an extra bag of feathers two lengths of rope some fishing lines and large hooks two tents a number of iron wedges and a crooked iron bar a wide piece of soft leather which as gwystyl reluctantly explained could be set about a willow frame to serve as a small boat several large bunches of dried vegetables and herbs and numerous bags of lichens in all colors for my condition gwystyl mumbled indicating the latter the dampness and clamminess around annuvin is dreadful these dont help at all but theyre better than nothing however youre welcome the bard shook his head in despair useless rubbish we might borrow the ropes and fish hooks but for whatever good they may do us gwystyl eilonwy cried angrily all your tents and boats and walking staves wont answer oh i could squeeze you anyway for im out of patience with you begone yes goodbye indeed gwystyl heaving huge sighs of relief rapidly began packing his bundle as he hoisted it to his shoulder from his cloak fell a small sack which he tried desperately to recover i say whats this asked rhun who had already gathered up the bag and was about to hand it to the agitated creature eggs mumbled gwystyl lucky they werent smashed when you took your tumble said rhun cheerfully perhaps wed better have a look he added untying the string around the mouth of the bag eggs said fflewddur brightening somewhat i shouldnt mind eating one or two of them ive had no food since midday those warriors kept me harping but they took no pains to feed me come old fellow im starved enough to crack one now arld swallow it raw no no squealed gwystyl snatching for the bag dont do it theyre not eggs not eggs at all i say they surely look like it remarked rhun peering into the sack if they arent then what are they gwystyl choked then went into a fit of violent coughing and sighing before he answered smoke he gasped chapter a clutch of eggs amazing cried king rhun smoke made of egg or is it egg made of smoke the smoke is inside gwystyl muttered drawing his shabby cloak about him goodbye crack the shell and the smoke comes out in considerable quantity keep them a gift if you should ever see lord gwydion warn him to shun annuvin at all cost for myself im glad to leave the place behind me and hope never to return goodbye gwystyl eilonwy said sharply gripping the melancholy creatures arm something tells me theres more to that cloak of yours than meets the eye what else have you hidden away the truth now or i promise you such squeezing nothing gwystyl choked despite the chill wind he had begun perspiring heavily his cobwebby hair hung limp and his brow dripped as if he had been caught in a downpour nothing that is but a few little personal things of my own odds and ends if they interest you by all means gwystyl raised his arms and spread his cloak on either side a gesture which made him resemble a longnosed and dismal bat he sighed and groaned miserably while the companions stared in surprise odd indeed said fflewddur and great belin theres no end of them neatly attached within the folds of the cloak hung a dozen cloth sacks mesh bags and carefully wrapped packets most of them seemed to contain clutches of eggs of the sort fflewddur had narrowly avoided eating gwystyl pulled off one of the mesh bags and handed it to eilonwy i say exclaimed rhun first eggs now mushrooms as far as the princess could see the mesh bag held nothing more than a few large brownspeckled toadstools but gwystyl waved his arms desperately and moaned beware beware break them and theyll singe your hair off they make a handsome puff of flame if you should ever need such a thing take them all im well pleased to be rid of them it is what we need eilonwy cried gwystyl forgive me for threatening to squeeze you she turned to the bard who was examining the sacks with an air of uneasiness yes these will help us now if we can find a way into the castle my dear princess replied fflewddur a fflam is dauntless but i hardly think it practical overcoming a stronghold with little more than eggs and mushrooms in our hands even eggs and mushrooms of this particular sort and yet he hesitated then snapped his fingers great belin we might pull it off at that wait im beginning to see the possibilities gwystyl meantime had unfastened the remaining packets from his voluminous cloak here he sighed since you have most of them you might as well have the rest all of it go on it makes no difference to me now the packets which gwystyl held out in a trembling hand were filled with a quantity of what appeared to be dark powdery earth put this on your feet and no one can see your tracks that is if someones looking for your tracks thats really what its for but if you throw it into someones eyes the cant see anything at all for a short while at least better and better cried fflewddur well have our friends out of the spiders clutches in no time a daring deed clouds of smoke billows of fire blinding powder and a fflam to the rescue that will give the bards something to sing about ah tell me old fellow he added uneasily to gwystyl youre quite sure those mushrooms work the companions hurriedly returned to the cover of the thicket to set their plans gwystyl after much coaxing and cajoling as well as hints of further squeezing and suggestions of king eiddilegs displeasure at last agreed with many a racking sigh and moan to help in the rescue the bard was eager to begin immediately in my long experience fflewddur said ive found it best to go at this kind of business head on first i shall return to the castle since the warriors know me theyll open the gates without a second thought under my cloak ill have gwystyls eggs and mushrooms directly the gates are open clouds of smoke a blast of fire the rest of you will be lurking behind me in the shadows at my signal we all rush in swords drawn shouting at the top of our voices amazing put in rhun it cant fail the king of mona frowned on the other hand it would almost seem not that i know anything about these matters wed be rushing into our own smoke and fire i mean to say the warriors couldnt see us but neither could we see them fflewddur shook his head in disagreement believe me my friend this is the best and quickest way ive rescued more captives than i have fingers on my hands the harp tensed and shuddered and a number of strings would have given way had not fflewddur added in the same breath planned to rescue that is ive never in strict point of fact actually done so rhun is right eilonwy declared it would be worse than stumbling over your own feet besides wed be risking everything at one go no we must have a better plan than that king rhun beamed surprised and delighted that his words had found agreement he blinked his pale blue eyes grinned shyly and ventured to raise his voice once more i suddenly think of the seawall ive been rebuilding he began in some hesitation i mean starting it from both ends unfortunately it didnt turn out quite as i had hoped but the idea was a good one now if we might try the same kind of thing not building a wall of course i mean going at caer cadarn from different ways fflewddur shrugged not a little crestfallen that his own suggestion had been dismissed but eilonwy nodded yes its the only sensible thing glew snorted the only sensible thing is to get an army behind you when i was a giant id have been willing to help you but i mean to have no part in this scheme the little man was about to say more but a glance from the bard silenced him never fear said fflewddur you and i will be together at every moment youll be in good hands now then broke in rhun impatient to speak again there are five of us some should climb over the rear wall the others enter at the gate the young king rose to his feet and his eyes flashed eagerly fflewddur fflam shall have the gates opened then while the others attack from the far wall i shall ride straight through the gates rhuns hand had gone to his sword his head was thrown back and he stood before the companions as proudly as if all the kings of mona were at his side he spoke on firmly and clearly with such joyful enthusiasm that eilonwy had no heart to stop him but at last she interrupted rhun im sorry eilonwy said but and i think fflewddur will agree with me you will serve better if you stay out of the actual fighting unless its absolutely necessary that way youll be on hand when youre needed but it wont be quite so dangerous for you rhuns face clouded with disappointment and dismay but i say youre not a prince any more eilonwy added before rhun could continue his protest youre king of mona your life isnt altogether your own dont you see you have a whole realm of people to think of and we shant let you take any more risks than you have to youll be in far too much danger as it is if queen teleria could have guessed the way things would turn out eilonwy added you wouldnt have sailed to caer dallben in the first place i dont see what my mother has to do with it cried rhun im sure my father would have wanted your father understood what it means to be a king eilonwy said gently you must learn as well as he did taran of caer dallben saved my life on mona rhun said urgently i am in his debt and it is a debt that i alone can pay you owe another kind of debt to the fisher folk of mona eilonwy replied and theirs is the greater claim rhun turned away and sat dejectedly on a hummock his sword trailing at his side fflewddur gave him an encouraging clap on the shoulder dont despair said the bard if our friend gwystyls eggs and mushrooms fail youll have more than your share of trouble so will we all it was nearly dawn and bitter cold when the little band left the concealment of the thicket and moved stealthily toward the lightless castle each carried a share of gwystyls mushrooms and eggs and a packet of his black loamy powder making a wide circle they now approached caer cadarn from its darkest most shadowed side remember the plan fflewddur warned under his breath it must go exactly as we set it when we are all in position gwystyl is to pop open one of those famous mushrooms of his the fire should draw the guards to the rear of the courtyard that will be your signal he said to eilonwy and rhun then and not before mind you be ready to force the gates open as soon as possible for i imagine we shall be rather in a hurry to get out at the same time ill free smoits men locked up in the guardroom theyll help you if you need them while i make my way to the larder and loose our friends we must hope that villainous spider hasnt already taken them away somewhere if he has well we shall have to make new plans on the spot and you old fellow fflewddur added to gwystyl as the dark walls loomed ahead i think its time for you to do as you promised gwystyl sighed heavily and his mouth drooped more wretchedly than ever im not up to climbing not today if only you could have waited next week perhaps or when the weather turns better well no matter theres little a person can do about it still shaking his head dubiously the gloomy creature set down the coils of rope he carried over his shoulder the large fish hooks taken from his bundle he now attached at various angles to the end of a slender line fascinated king rhun watched as gwystyl with a deft movement flung the line into the air from the parapet high above came a faint rasping sound then a dry click as the hooks caught on a projecting stone gwystyl tugged at the cord and slung the remaining coils of rope about his neck i say rhun whispered will that fishing line hold you gwystyl sighed and looked mournfully at him i doubt it nevertheless mumbling and moaning he quickly hoisted himself into the air hanging an instant before his feet found the stones of the wall pulling himself up on the line and scrabbling with his feet against the sheer side of the castle gwystyl was soon out of sight amazing cried rhun the bard frantically cautioned him to silence a moment later the fishing line was hauled up and the end of one of the heavier ropes came swinging down the bard lifted glew who was protesting as loudly as he dared and boosted him onto the dangling cord up you go fflewddur muttered ill be right behind you rhun followed as the bard and the former giant disappeared into the shadows eilonwy seized the rope and felt herself rapidly drawn aloft she swung herself over the parapet and dropped to a projecting ledge gwystyl had already scuttled toward the rear of the castle fflewddur and glew slid into the darkness below king rhun grinned at eilonwy and crouched against the cold stones the moon was down the sky had turned black amid the shadows of the silent buildings the stables and the long dark mass which eilonwy guessed to be smoits great hall the low flames of a watch fire gleamed farther along the parapet in the direction of the gates the figures of the guards stood motionless drowsing i say its dark enough rhun whispered cheerfully we shant need gwystyls powder at this rate i can hardly see as it is eilonwy turned her eyes in the direction gwystyl had taken waiting from one endless moment to the next for the signal rhun was tensed ready to fling himself down the rope a shout rang from the courtyard at the same instant a cloud of crimson flame burst in the shadows of the great hall eilonwy jumped to her feet somethings amiss she cried fflewddur attacks too soon it was only then that she saw a burst of fire at the far end of the castle more shouts of alarm rose above the clatter of racing footsteps but the warriors eilonwy saw with sinking heart ran not to gwystyls false attack but to the great hall the courtyard seethed with shadows torches sprang to light quickly eilonwy shouted the gates rhun swung from the ledge eilonwy was about to follow him when she glimpsed a bowman at one of the guard posts on the wall he raced toward her then halted to take aim hastily eilonwy drew a mushroom from her cloak and flung it at the warrior it fell short and split against the stones fire spurted blinding her the flames leaped in a roaring searing cloud the bowman shouted in terror and staggered back his arrow whistled past her head the girl seized the rope and dropped into the courtyard below chapter the king of mona in the larder which had become a prison gurgi was first to hear the shouts of alarm though muffled by the heavy walls the cries brought him to his feet before the other companions were aware of the tumult beyond their cell all night fearing the arrival of magg from one moment to the next they had vainly sought escape exhausted from their efforts they dozed fitfully by turns hoping only to sell their lives dearly when the guards at last came for them fightings and smitings gurgi cried is it for weary tired captives yes yes it must be yes we are here he ran to the door and began shouting through the iron grating now taran heard what seemed to be a clash of swords coll and king smoit were quickly beside him gwydion had already reached the door in two strides and drew away the excited gurgi beware gwydion sharply warned fflewddur fflam may have found a way to free us but if the castle is aroused magg may take our lives before our comrades can save us footsteps rang outside the lock of the heavy door began to rattle and the companions fell back crouched and ready to set upon their captors the door was flung open into the cell burst eilonwy follow me she cried in one upraised hand she held the brightly glowing bauble and with the other pulled a sack from her belt take these the mushrooms are fire the eggs are smoke throw them at anyone who attacks you and this powder it will blind them i couldnt find weapons she hurried on ive set smoits warriors free but fflewddurs trapped in the courtyard everythings gone wrong our plan has failed smoit bellowing in rage dashed to the door away with your toadstools and rooster eggs he roared my hands are all i need to wring a traitors neck gwydion sprang through the doorway with coll and gurgi behind him taran sped after eilonwy from the corridors of the great hall taran raced into what was neither daylight nor darkness huge billows of dense white smoke rose in the courtyard blotting out the dawn sky like swaying twisting waves they shifted as the wind caught them lifted a moment to show a struggling knot of warriors then flooded back in an impenetrable tide here and there roaring columns of fire writhed through the smoke losing sight of eilonwy taran plunged into the swirling clouds a warrior brought up his sword and slashed at him taran stumbled to escape the blow with outflung hand he cast his small store of powder in the mans face the warrior fell back as if stunned his wideopen eyes stared blankly at nothing taran snatched the blade from the baffled guard and raced on a smoit a smoit the redbearded kings war cry rang from the stables before smoke filled his eyes again taran caught a fleeting glimpse of the furious smoit armed with a huge scythe and laying about him like a bear turned harvester the luckless gurgi however had stumbled with his eggs still clutched in his hands smoke poured over him for an instant all taran could see of him was a pair of waving hairy arms before these too vanished in the billows yelling at the top of his voice gurgi spun about and dashed frantically wherever his feet led him warriors shouted and fled from this fearsome whirlwind king smoit taran realized was trying to rally his own men around him and taran attempted to fight his way toward the stables coll briefly was at his side the stout warrior had just gained a blade from a fallen opponent flinging aside the hoe which until then had served him as a weapon coll threw his bulk against the press of swordsmen besetting fflewddur fftam taran leaped into the fray striking left and right with telling blows maggs warriors fell back the bard joined taran as they raced across the court where is rhun taran cried i dont know fflewddur gasped he and eilonwy were to open the gates for us but great belin whats happened since then i cant guess everything has changed one of maggs men trod on glew and we were discovered before we could go another step from then on the fat was in the fire where glew is now i have no idea though the little weasel gave a fair account of himself i must say so did gwystyl gwystyl taran stammered how never mind replied fflewddur well tell you later if there is a later they had nearly reached the stables taran caught sight of gwydion the prince of dons wolfgray head towered above the milling warriors but tarans relief at gwydions safety turned to despair he saw through the shifting clouds the tide of battle was turning against the companions only a handful of smoits men had been able to rally for an attack the others were cut off locked in combat throughout the courtyard to the gates gwydion commanded fly all who can with sinking heart taran realized the little band was grievously outnumbered dimly taran saw the gates had been opened but more of maggs warriors had joined their fellows and the way to safety was blocked suddenly a mounted figure galloped into the courtyard it was rhun astride his dapple gray the king of monas boyish face shone with a furious light as the steed reared and plunged rhun swung his sword about his head and shouted at the top of his voice bowmen follow me all of you into the court he spun the mare about and beckoned with his sword his words rang above the clash of arms spearmen this way make haste hes brought help taran cried help echoed the amazed bard theres no one within miles rhun had not ceased to gallop back and forth amid the struggling warriors shouting orders as if a whole army streamed behind him maggs men turned to face the unseen foe a ruse exclaimed fflewddur hes a madman it will never work but it does at a glance taran saw their assailants had broken away seeking in confusion to engage what they imagined to be fresh attackers taran brought his horn to his lips and sounded the charge maggs men faltered believing the foe was now at their backs at that instant llyan burst through the gates the men who saw her shouted in terror as the huge cat leaped forward llyan paid no heed to the warriors but raced across the court while the swordsmen dropped their weapons and fled at her approach shes looking for me fflewddur cried here i am old girl king smoits embattled fighting men seized this moment to press forward with a mighty surge many of maggs warriors had already flown feardriven they slashed and stabbed among themselves in blind panic rhun galloped on and vanished into the smoke hes duped them well fflewddur shouted jubilantly for all the good those eggs and mushrooms did us it was rhun who turned the trick the bard hastened to llyan gwydion taran saw was now on horseback goldenmaned melyngar streaked across the courtyard as gwydion urged the mare to overtake the retreating foe smoit and coll had also leaped astride their steeds behind them galloped gwystyl smoits warriors too joined the pursuit taran ran to find melynlas but before he reached the stables he heard eilonwy call his name he turned the girl her face smudged her robe torn beckoned urgently come she called rhun is badly hurt taran raced to follow her near the far wall the dapple gray stood riderless the king of moxia was sitting on the ground his legs stretched in front of him his back resting against a cart still smouldering from gwystyls fiery mushrooms gurgi and glew both unharmed were at his side hullo hullo rhun murmured and waved a hand his face was deathly white the day is ours taran said without you it would have gone differently dont move he cautioned loosening the young kings bloodstained jacket taran frowned anxiously an arrow had suck deep in rhuns side and the shaft had broken amazing rhun whispered ive never been in battle before and i wasnt sure of of anything at all but i say the oddest things kept running through my head i was thinking of the seawall at mona haven isnt it surprising yes your plan will work very well rhun murmured his eyes wandered and suddenly he looked very young very lost and a little frightened and i think i think i shall be glad to be home he made an effort to raise himself taran bent quickly to him fflewddur had come up with llyan loping at his heels so there you are old boy he called to rhun i told you wed have more than our share of trouble but you pulled us out of it oh the bards will sing of you taran lifted a griefstricken face the king of mona is dead silent and heavy hearted the companions raised a burial mound a little distance from caer cadarn the warriors of smoit joined them and at dusk horsemen bearing torches rode slowly circling the mound to honor the king of mona as the last flame died taran came to stand before the burial place farewell rhun son of rhuddlum your seawall is unfinished he said gently but i promise you your work shall not be left undone your fisher folk shall have their safe harbor if i must build it for you with my own hands soon after nightfall gwydion coll and king smoit returned magg had eluded them and the fruitless pursuit had left them worn and haggard they too mourned the death of rhun and did honor to all the fallen warriors gwydion then led the companions to the great hall arawn deathlord gives us little time for grief and we shall mourn others i fear before our tasks are done he said i must tell you now of a choice carefully to be weighed gwystyl of the fair folk has left us and continues his journey to king eiddilegs realm before we parted he told me further of the gathering of arawns hosts maggs words were not evil boasting gwystyl judges as do i that arawn means to defeat us in one last battle his armies gather even now there is grave risk and perhaps fatal risk in leaving dyrnwyn in arawns grasp gwydion went on yet we must face the more pressing danger no longer will i seek the black sword whatever strength it may yield him in my own strength i will stand against him to the death i ride not to annuvin but to caer dathyl to rally the sons of don no one spoke for some moments at length coll replied to my mind you have chosen wisely prince of don smoit and fflewddur fflam nodded their agreement would that i were as sure of my wisdom gwydion replied heavily so be it then taran rose and faced gwydion is there no way one of us can breach the deathlords stronghold must the search for dyrnwyn indeed be given up i read your thoughts assistant pigkeeper gwydion replied you will serve me best if you obey my commands gwystyl warns that a journey to annuvin can mean only wasted life and more than that a loss of precious time gwystyls nature is to conceal his nature but among the fair folk none is shrewder or more trustworthy i heed his warning and so must all of you gwystyl has promised to do all in his power to gain help from the fair folk gwydion went on king eiddileg has no great fondness for the race of men yet even he must see that arawns victory would blight all prydain the fair folk would suffer no less than we but we dare not count too heavily on eiddileg our own armies must be gathered and our battle host raised in this our greatest help will come from king pryderi of the west domains no lord in prydain commands a mightier army his allegiance to the house of don is firm and between us are strong bonds of friendship i will send word to pryderi and pray him to join his host with ours at caer dathyl there must we all meet gwydion continued before then i ask king smoit to muster every loyal warrior in his cantrev and the dominions closest to his he turned to the bard fflewddur fflam son of godo you are a king in your own northern realms return there without delay to you i entrust the rallying of the northern cantrevs and you assistant pigkeeper gwydion said seeing the question in tarans eyes your own task is urgent you are well known to the folk of the free commots i charge you to raise whatever force you can among them lead all who will follow you to caer dathyl gurgi and coll son of collfrewr will ride with you so too will the princess eilonwy her safety is in your hands im glad eilonwy murmured theres been no talk of sending me home gwystyl tells us many of arawns liegemen are already marching coll said to her the valley cantrevs are too dangerous whatever otherwise princess he added with a grin you would long since have been on your way to caer dallben well before dawn gwydion and fflewddur fflam rode from caer cadarn each to follow his separate path king smoit girded for battle set out from the castle and with him went lord gast and lord goryon who had learned belatedly of the attack on their king and now hastened to join him faced with the common danger the two rivals had put aside their quarrel goryon declined to take insult at gasts every word gast refrained from giving offense to goryon and neither so much as mentioned cows that same morning a gnarled grayheaded farmer strode up to taran in the castle courtyard it was aeddan who had befriended him long before in smoits cantrev the two clasped hands warmly but the farmers face was grim there is no time now to speak of time past aeddan said i offer you friendship and this he added unsheathing a rusted sword it has served once and can serve again say where you ride and i will go with you i value the sword and value more the man who bears it answered taran but your place is with your king follow him and hope that you and i will meet on a happier day as gwydion had ordered taran and the remaining companions waited at smoits castle hoping kaw might arrive with further tidings but when the following day brought no sign of the crow they made ready for their own departure eilonwys needlework had gone unscathed and she carefully unfolded it youre a war leader now she said proudly to taran but ive never heard of a war leader without a battle flag with leather thongs she bound the stillunfinished embroidery to the end of a spear there said eilonwy as an emblem hen wen may not be properly terrifying and yet for an assistant pigkeeper shes very likely the most fitting they rode through the gates gurgi at tarans side raised the spear high and the wind caught at the banner of the white pig above the smokeblackened fortress and the burial mound whose fresh earth was already frostcovered the clouds had grown heavy soon there would be snow chapter the messengers from the moment he left caer dallben kaw had flown directly toward annuvin though it was the birds pleasure aloft to revel in the limitless reaches of the sky to swoop and soar above the white sheep flocks of clouds he now put aside all temptation to sport with the wind and held steadily to his course far below avren glinted like a long trickle of molten silver fallow fields spread in patches the treetops rose black and leafless broken by dark green stretches of pine forest following the curves of the hills kaw pressed ever northwestward resting seldom during the hours of daylight only at dusk when even the crows keen eyes could not search beyond the gathering shadows did he drop to earth and find haven among the branches of a tree days he flew high above the clouds to profit from the wind tides that bore him swiftly as a leaf in a stream but as he passed over the forest of idris drawing closer to the harsh peaks of annuvin kaw checked his gliding flight and drove earthward alert for any stirring among the mountain passes shortly he glimpsed a column of heavily armed warriors marching northward at closer range he saw them to be huntsmen of annuvin for a time he followed them and when they halted amid the scrub and stunted trees flapped to a low branch and settled there squatting at their cook fires the huntsmen prepared their midday meal the crow cocked his head and listened intently but their muttered speech told him little until he heard the words caer dathyl kaw shifted his position and cast about for a closer branch one of the huntsmen a brutish warrior garbed in bearskin caught sight of the bird grinning cruelly at this chance for sport the warrior reached for his bow and nocked an arrow to the string quickly he aimed and loosed the shaft rapid though the huntsmans movements were the crows sharp eyes followed them as quickly kaw flapped his wings and dodged the arrow that went rattling through the dead branches a little distance over his head the huntsman cursed both his lost arrow and the crow and made to draw again delighted with himself jeering raucously kaw sped above the trees intending to circle back and find a safer listening post it was then the gwythaints appeared for an instant bent on returning to the huntsmens camp kaw did not see the flight of three huge birds from a bank of clouds they plunged downward in a rush of black beating wings kaws selfsatisfaction vanished the crow veered from their attack and strove desperately to climb higher not daring to allow the deadly creatures to command the air above him the gwythaints too swiftly veered one broke from his fellows to pursue the fleeing crow the others with powerful strokes of their wings rose toward the clouds to renew their assault kaw forced himself ever upward and the gwythaint had gained only slightly when the crow burst through a sea of mist into a sunswept vastness that nearly blinded him the other two gwythaints were waiting shrieking in fury they dropped toward him behind the crow his pursuer drove him closer to the oncoming creatures kaw glimpsed the flash of glistening beaks and bloodred eyes the gwythaints screams of triumph ripped the empty sky the crow suddenly checked his flight feigning confusion when the gwythaints were nearly upon him he summoned all his strength in a single lunge that carried him beyond the talons slashing like daggers the crow had not gone unscathed one of the gwythaints had struck him beneath the wing despite the pain that dizzied him kaw fluttered free of his attackers the open sky was no refuge for him no longer could he rely on swiftness of flight to save him he plunged earthward the gwythaints were not outwitted the scent of blood had maddened them and they would not be deprived of their kill they streaked after the crow to overtake and prevent him from reaching the forest below the highest trees rose up toward kaw he avoided them to drop closer to the underbrush the tangle of branches slowed his pursuers without slackening speed kaw skimmed above the ground deeper and deeper into the maze of bushes the huge wings of the gwythaints which had served so well aloft now kept them from their prize they screamed in rage but made no attempt to venture farther into the woods the crow like a fox had gone to earth the day had begun to fade kaw settled himself painfully for the night at dawn he fluttered cautiously to a treetop the gwythaints had gone but his senses told him he had been driven far east of annuvin stiffly he launched himself from the tree and flapped his way aloft southward caer cadarn lay beyond the reach of his ebbing strength he must decide quickly while life still remained to him kaw circled once then flew heavily toward his new goal and his only hope his flight was now a constant torment often his wings faltered and only the windtides held him aloft he could no longer travel a full days distance long before sundown his wound forced him to alight and hide himself amid the trees nor could he fly closer to the suns warmth but made his way only a little above the ground nearly brushing the treetops below him the countryside was springing to life with warriors both on horseback and afoot during the times he halted to husband his strength he learned their destination like that of the huntsmen was the fortress of the sons of don his alarm grew sharper than his pain and he flew onward at length in the numbing cold of the mountains northeast of the river ystrad he dimly spied what he had been seeking surrounded by sheer walls of cliffs the valley was a green nest amid the snowcapped summits a small cottage came into sight the blue surface of a lake flashed in the sunlight against the protected side of a hill slope stretched a long boatlike shape the vessels ribs and timbers overgrown with moss beating his wings feebly kaw dropped like a stone into the valley he was vaguely aware as his eyes closed of jaws firmly about him lifting him from the grass then a deep voice asking now brynach what have you brought us the crow knew nothing more when he opened his eyes again he lay upon a soft nest of rushes in a sunny chamber he was weak but his pain had left him his wound had been bound up as he feebly fluttered his wings a pair of strong hands deftly reached to hold and calm him gently gently said a voice i fear you will be earthbound for a time the mans whitebearded face was as gnarled and weathered as an ancient oak in a snowdrift white hair hung below broad knotted shoulders and a blue gem sparkled from the golden band circling his brow kaw without his customary squawking and jabbering humbly bowed his head never before had he flown to this valley but his heart had always known such a refuge awaited him a secret sense like some hidden memory he shared with all the forest creatures of prydain had guided him unerringly and the crow understood he had come at last into the abode of medwyn let me see let me see medwyn continued knitting his heavy brows in search of something long stored in a corner of his mind you would be yes the family likeness is unmistakable kaw son of kadwyr yes of course forgive me for not recognizing you immediately but there are so many crow clans i sometimes get them mixed i knew your father when he was a spindlylegged fledgling medwyn smiled at his own recollections the rogue was no stranger to my valley a broken wing to be mended a leg out of joint one scrape after the other i hope you do not follow his example medwyn added i have already heard much of your bravery and a certain bent shall we say for boisterousness it has reached my ears as well that you serve an assistant pigkeeper at caer dallben melynlas is his name i believe no forgive me that is his steed of course melynlas son of melyngar the pigkeepers name escapes me at the moment but no matter serve him faithfully son of kadwyr for his heart is good among all the race of men he was of the few i allowed within my valley as for you i judge you and the gwythaints have been at close quarters have a care many of arawns messengers rove aloft these days but you are safe now and will soon be up and winging perched on the back of medwyns chair an enormous eagle studied the crow beside the old man the wolf brynach sat on his haunches lean and gray with yellow eyes he wagged his tail and grinned up at the crow a moment later another wolf smaller and with a white blaze on her breast trotted in and crouched beside her mate ah briavael said medwyn have you come to greet our visitor like his father no doubt he will have a bold tale to tell us kaw spoke then in his own tongue which medwyn easily understood the old mans features turned grave as he listened when the crow had finished medwyn was silent for a time deeply frowning brynach whined uneasily it is come medwyn said heavily i should have so guessed for i sense a strange fear among the animals more and more find their way here fleeing what they themselves only dimly know they tell of huntsmen abroad in force and armed men now i understand the meaning of these tidings the day i had ever feared has come upon us yet my valley can not hold all who would seek refuge medwyns voice had begun to rise like a wrathful gale the race of men face the slavery of annuvin so too the creatures of prydain in the shadow of the land of the dead the nightingales song will choke and die the galleries of badgers and moles will become prison houses no beast no bird will roam or fly with the joy of a free heart those who are not slain theirs will be the fate of the gwythaints long ago made captive tormented broken and their oncegentle spirits twisted to arawns vile ends medwyn turned to the eagle you edyrnion fly swiftly to the mountain eyries of your kindred bid them rise up in all their strength and all their numbers you brynach and you briavael he commanded as the wolves pricked up their ears spread the alarm among your own brethren among the bears with paws to smite and arms to crush among the sharpantlered stags and all forest dwellers large and small medwyn had risen to his full height his hands clenched as tree roots clench the earth the crow watched awestruck and silent medwyns eyes flashed and his deep voice came as a wave of thunder speak to them in my name and tell them such are the words of one who built a ship when the dark waters flooded prydain of one who bore their ancient sires to safety now against this flood of evil each nest each lair must be a stronghold let every creature turn tooth beak and claw against all who serve arawn deathlord side by side the wolves loped from the cottage and the eagle took flight chapter the banner light snow fell before before the companions had journeyed a day from king smoits castle and by the time they reached the valley of ystrad the slopes were whitecloaked and ice had begun to sheathe the river they forded while frozen splinters cut at the legs of their horses and wended through the bleak hill cantrevs pressing eastward toward the free commots of all the band gurgi suffered most grievously from the cold though bundled in a huge garment of sheepskin the unhappy creature shivered wretchedly his lips were blue his teeth chattered and ice droplets clung to his matted hair nevertheless he kept pace at tarans side and his numbed hands did not loosen their grip on the banner days of harsh travel brought them across small avren to cenarth where taran had chosen to begin the rallying of the commot folk but even as he rode into the cluster of thatchroofed cottages he saw the village thronged with men and among them hevydd the smith barrelchested and bristlebearded who shouldered his way through the crowd and clapped taran on the back with a hand that weighed as much as one of his own hammers a good greeting to you wanderer called the smith we saw you afar and gathered to welcome you a good greeting to good friends taran replied but i bring a stern task in exchange for a warm welcome hear me well he went on urgently what i ask is not asked lightly nor granted lightly the strength of your hands and the courage of your hearts and if it must be even your lives as the commot folk murmuring pressed around him taran spoke of what had befallen gwydion and of the rising of arawn when he had finished the men were grimfaced and for a long moment all stood silent then hevydd the smith lifted his voice the folk of the free commots honor king math and the house of don he said but they will answer only to one they know as a friend and follow him not in obligation but in friendship and so let hevydd be the first to follow taran wanderer all follow all cried the cornmot men as with a single voice and on the instant the oncepeaceful cenarth stirred like a gathering storm as each man hastened to arm himself but hevydd gave taran and the companions a hard grin our will is strong but our weapons lack he declared no matter wanderer you toiled bravely in my smithy now shall my smithy toil for you and i will send word to every metalsmith in the commot lands to labor as hard for you as i myself will do while the men readied their mounts and hevydd set his forge to blazing taran led the companions to the neighboring commots his task became quickly known and each day brought its throng of herdsmen and farmers who needed no urging to march in the growing host following the banner of the white pig for taran days and nights merged into one another in the marshaling camps astride unflagging melynlas he rode among the gatherings of peaceful men turned warriors seeing to their provisions and equipment and by the embers of watch fires held council with the newformed war bands when he had accomplished all he could at cenarth hevydd rejoined taran to serve as his master armorer you have done your work well but we still go too lightly armed taran said speaking apart with the smith i fear all the forges in prydain will not be enough to serve our need somehow i must find a way and so you shall with luck called a voice taran turned to see a horseman who was riding up beside him and blinked in surprise for this was the strangestgarbed of all the commot warriors the man was tall lankhaired with legs as spindly as a storks and so long they almost touched the ground on either side of his mount bits of iron and odds and ends of metal were stitched closely all over his jacket he carried a wooden staff with a scythe blade at the end on his head he wore what had once been a cookpot now worked and shaped into a makeshift helmet that sat so low on the mans forehead it nearly covered his eyes llonio taran cried warmly clasping the new arrivals hand llonio son of llonwen none other answered llonio pushing back his peculiar headpiece did you not suppose id be along sooner or later but your wife and family taran began i would not ask you to leave them why of children i remember halfadozen and another merrily on the way llonio replied grinning happily perhaps twins with my kind of luck but my brood will be safe enough till i return indeed if there is ever to be safety in prydain i must follow the wanderer now but your concern is not babes in arms but menatarms hear me friend wanderer llonio went on i have seen pitchforks and hayrakes among the commot folk could not the tines be cut off and set in wooden shafts thus would you gain three four and even more weapons where you had only one to begin with why so we could burst out hevydd how did i not see that myself nor more did i admitted taran llonio sees more sharply than any of us but calls luck what another would call keen wits go friend llonio find what you can i know youll find more than meets the eye as llonio with the help of hevydd the smith gleaned the commots for sickles rakes fire tongs scythes and pruning hooks and found ways to make even the most unlikely objects serve a new purpose the store of weapons grew while each day taran rallied followers in greater numbers coll gurgi and eilonwy helped load carts with gear and provisions a task by no means to the liking of the princess who was more eager to gallop from one commot to the next than she was to plod beside the heavyladen wagons eilonwy had donned mans garments and braided her hair about her head at her belt hung a sword and short dagger wheedled from hevydd the smith her warriors garb was illfitting but she took pride in it and was therefore all the more vexed when taran refused to let her go afield youll ride out with me taran said as soon as the pack animals are tended and their loads secured the princess reluctantly agreed but next day when taran cantered past the horse lines at the rear of the camp she furiously cried to him youve tricked me these tasks will never be done no sooner do i finish with one string of horses and carts than along come some more very well i shall do as t promised but war leader or no taran of caer dallben im not speaking to you taran grinned and rode on bearing northward through the valley of great avren the companions entered commot gwenith and had scarcely dismounted when taran heard a crackling voice call out wanderer i know you seek warriors not crones but tarry a moment and give a greeting to one who has not forgotten you dwyvach the weaverwoman of gwenith stood in her cottage doorway despite her white hair and wizened features she looked as lively and untired as ever her gray eyes scanned taran sharply then turned to eilonwy the ancient weaverwoman beckoned to her taran wanderer i know well enough and who you may be i can guess well enough even though you go in the guise of a man and your hair could stand a little washing she glanced shrewdly at the princess indeed i was sure when the wanderer and i first met that he had a pretty maiden in his thoughts humph eilonwy sniffed im not sure if he did then and even less sure if he does now dwyvach chuckled if you are not then no one else can be time will tell which of us is right but meanwhile child she added unfolding a cloak she held in her withered hands and setting it about eilonwys shoulders take this as a gift from a crone to a maiden and know there is not so much difference between the two for even a tottering granddam keeps a portion of girlish heart and the youngest maiden a thread of old womans wisdom taran had now come to the cottage door he warmly greeted the weaverwoman and admired the cloak she had given eilonwy hevydd and the commot smiths labor to make arms for us he said but warriors need warmth as much as weapons alas we have no garments like this do you think a weaverwoman less hardy than a metalsmith dwyvach replied as you wove patiently at my loom now my loom will weave the more quickly for you and in every commot shuttles will fly for the sake of taran wanderer heartened by the weaverwomans promise the companions departed from gwenith a short distance from the commot taran caught sight of a small band of horsemen riding toward him at a quick pace leading them was a tall youth who shouted tarans name and raised a hand in greeting with a glad cry taran urged melynlas to meet the riders llassar taran called reining up beside the young man i did not think you and i would meet so far from your sheepfold in commot isav your news travels ahead of you wanderer llassar replied but i feared you would deem our commot too small and pass it by it was i he added with shy hesitation that could not altogether conceal his boyish prideit was l who led our folk to find you the size of isav is no measure of its courage taran said and i need and welcome all of you but where is your father he asked glancing at the band of riders where is drudwas he would not let his son journey so far without him llassars face fell the winter took him from us i grieve for him but honor his memory by doing what he himself would have done and what of your mother taran asked as he and llassar trotted back to join the companions was it her wish too that you leave home and flock others will tend my flock the young shepherd answered my mother knows what a child must do and what a man must do i am a man he added stoutly and have been one since you and i stood against dorath and his ruffians that night in the sheepfold yes yes cried gurgi and fearless gurgi stood against them too im sure all of you did eilonwy remarked sourly while i was curtsying and having my hair washed on mona i dont know who dorath is but if i should ever meet him i promise you ill make up for lost time taran shook his head count yourself lucky you dont know him i know him all too well to may sorrow he has not troubled us since that night said llassar nor will he likely trouble us again i have heard he has left the commot lands and roves westward he has put his sword in the service of the deathlord it is said perhaps it may be so but if dorath serves anyone it is himself your service freely given counts more for us than any the lord of annuvin could hire taran said to llassarprince gwydion will be grateful to you to you rather said llassar our pride is not in fighting but in farming in the work of our hands not our blades never have we sought war we come now to the banner of the white pig because it is the banner of our friend taran wanderer the weather worsened as the companions continued through the valley and the growing host of commot men forced them to travel at a slower pace the days were too short for the work to be done but taran rode grimly on beside him galloped coll uncomplaining and ever cheerful his broad face reddened and roughened by cold and wind was nearly hidden by the collar of a great fleecelined jacket a sword belt of heavy iron links bound his girth and at his back hung a round shield of ox hide he had found a helmet of beaten metal but deemed it did not sit as comfortably on his bald crown as had his old leather cap taran was grateful for colls wisdom and gladly sought his counsel it was coll who gave him the thought as the marshaling camps grew crowded to send smaller swifter bands directly to caer dathyl rather than march from one commot to the next with a force becoming ever more cumbersome llassar hevydd and llonio would not leave tarans vanguard and stayed ever close at hand but when taran wrapped himself in a cloak and stretched on the frozen ground for rare moments of sleep it was coll who stood watch over him you are the oaken staff i lean on taran said more than that he laughed you are the whole sturdy tree and a true warrior coll instead of beaming looked wryly at him do you mean to honor me he asked then say rather i am a true grower of turnips and a gatherer of apples no warrior whatever save that i am needed thus for a while my garden longs for me as much as i long for it coll added i left it unready for winter and for that i will pay a sorry reckoning at spring planting taran nodded we shall dig and weed together true grower of turnips and true friend the watch fires flickered in the night the horses stirred in their lines about them a mass of deep shadows dark against darkness lay sleeping warriors the chill wind cut at tarans face he was suddenly weary to the marrow of his bones he turned to coll my heart too will be easier he said when i am once more an assistant pigkeeper word reached taran that king smoit had raised a strong host among the cantrev lords and was now turning northward the companions learned too that certain of arawns liegemen had sent war parties across ystrad to harass the columns marching to caer dathyl tarans task thus grew more urgent but he could do no more than press onward with all haste the companions made their way to commot merin for taran it had been among the fairest he had known in all his wanderings even now amid the tumult of warriors arming of neighing horses and shouting riders the white thatched cottages of the little village seemed to stand peaceful and apart taran galloped past the common fields ringed by hemlocks and tall firs his heart laden with memories he reined up at a familiar hut whose smoking chimney betokened a warm fire within the door opened and out stepped a stocky hale old man garbed in a coarse brown robe his irongray hair and beard were cropped short his eyes were blue and undimmed well met he called to taran and raised a huge hand crusted with dried clay you left us a wanderer and return to us a war leader as for your skill in the latter i have heard much but i ask have you forgotten your skill at my potters wheel or have i wasted my own to teach you well met annlaw clayshaper taran answered swinging down from melynlas and fondly clasping the old potters hand wasted in truth taran laughed following him into the hut for the master had a clumsy apprentice my skill lacks but not my memory what little i could learn i have not forgotten show me then challenged the potter scooping a handful of wet clay from a wooden trough taran smiled sadly and shook his head i halted only to give you greeting he replied now i labor with swords not earthen bowls nevertheless he paused the hearth light glowed on shelves and rows of pottery of graceful wine jars of ewers handsomely and lovingly crafted quickly he took the cool clay and cast it upon the wheel which annlaw had begun to spin time pressed him too closely taran knew yet as the work took form under his hands for a moment he put down the burden of his other task the days turned back and there was only the whirring of the wheel and the shape of the vessel born from the shapeless clay well done said annlaw in a quiet voice then added i have heard how smiths and weavers throughout the commots labor to give you arms and raiment but my wheel can not forge a blade nor weave a warriors cloak and my clay is shaped only for peaceful tasks alas i can offer nothing that will serve you now you have given me more than all the others taran answered and i treasure it the most my way is not the warriors way yet if i do not bear my sword now there will be no place in prydain for the usefulness and beauty of any craftsmans handiwork and if i fail i will have lost all i gained from you his hand faltered for colls booming voice was shouting his name taran sprang from the wheel and while annlaw watched in alarm strode out of the hut calling a hurried farewell to the potter coll had already drawn his sword in another moment llassar joined them they galloped toward the camp a little way from merin as coll hastily told taran that the guard posts had sighted a band of marauders they shall soon be upon us coll warned we should meet them before they attack our trains as a grower of turnips i advise you to rouse a company of bowmen and a troop of good riders llassar and i shall try to lure them with a smaller band of warriors quickly they set their plans taran rode ahead calling to the horsemen and foot soldiers who hastily caught up their weapons and followed after him he ordered eilonwy and gurgi to safety among the carts without waiting to hear their protests he galloped toward the fir forest covering the outlying hills the marauders were armed more heavily than taran had expected swiftly they sped down from the snowcovered ridge at a sign from taran the bowmen raced and flung themselves into a shallow gully and the mounted warriors of the commots wheeled to the charge the riders met in a turmoil of hoofs and clash of blades then taran raised his horn to his lips at the piercing echoing signal the bowmen rose from cover it was taran knew little more than a skirmish but sharply and hotly fought only at the last when coll and llassars band drew off many of the foe did the marauders break and flee yet it was the first battle taran had commanded as a war leader for the prince of don the commot folk had carried the day with none of their number slain and only a few wounded though weary and drained of his strength tarans heart pounded with the joy of victory as he led the exulting warriors from the forest and back toward merin as he reached the hill crest he saw flames and black billows of smoke at first he thought the camp had taken fire he spurred melynlas at top speed down the slope as he drew closer as the crimson tongues wavered against the sky in a bloodstained sunset and the smoke rose and spread over the valley he saw it was the commot burning outdistancing the troop he galloped into merin among the warriors from the camp taran glimpsed eilonwy and gurgi struggling vainly to quench the flames coll had reached the village before him taran leaped from melynlas and ran to his side too late coll cried the raiders circled and stormed the commot from the rear merin has been put to the torch and its folk to the sword with a terrible cry of grief and rage taran ran past the blazing cottages the thatch had burned from the roofs and many of the walls had split and crumbled so it was with the hut of annlaw which still smouldered its ruins open to the sky the body of the potter lay amid the rubble of the work of his hands all had been shattered the wheel was overturned the bowl flung into pieces taran dropped to his knees colls hand was on his shoulder but he drew himself away and stared up at the old warrior did i shout for victory today he whispered hoarsely small comfort to folk who once befriended me have i served them well the blood of merin is on my hands later llassar spoke apart with coll the wanderer has not stirred from the potters hut the shepherd murmured it is harsh enough for each man to bear his own wound but he who leads bears the wounds of all who follow him coll nodded leave him where he chooses to be in the morning he will be well he added though likely never healed by midwinter the last of the war bands had been gathered and the commot warriors dispatched to caer dathyl in addition to a troop of horsemen llassar hevydd and llonio still remained with taran who now led the companions northwestward through the llawgadarn mountains the force was strong enough to safeguard their progress without slowing their journey twice marauders attacked them and twice tarans followers beat them off inflicting heavy losses the raiders having learned a bitter lesson from the war leader who rode under the ensign of the white pig slunk away and dared harass the columns no further the companions passed swiftly and unhindered through the foothills of the eagle mountains gurgi still proudly carried the banner which snapped and fluttered in the sharp winds lashing from the distant heights in his cloak taran bore one talisman a shard of broken fireblackened pottery from commot merin at the approaches to caer dathyl outriders brought word of still another host taran galloped ahead in a vanguard of spearmen rode fflewddur fflam great belin shouted the bard urging llyan to tarans side gwydion shall rejoice the northern lords arm in all their strength when a fflam commands yes well i did rally them in the name of gwydion otherwise they might not have been so willing but no matter theyre on the way ive heard king pryderi too has raised his armies then youll see a battle host i daresay half the western cantrevs are under his command oh yes fflewddur added as taran caught sight of glew perched atop a swaybacked heavyhoofed gray horse the little fellow is still with us the former giant busily gnawing a bone gave taran only a scant sign of recognition i didnt know what to do with him said fflewddur in a low voice i hadnt the heart to send him packing not in the midst of all the armies gathering so here he is hes not stopped whining and complaining his feet hurt one day his head the next and little by little all the rest of him then in between meals he goes on with his endless tales of when he was a giant the worst of it is fflewddur went on in some dismay hes given my ears such a drubbing that hes made me almost feel sorry for him hes a smallhearted weasel always was and always will be but as you stop and think on it he has been considerably mistreated and put upon now when clew was a giant the bard interrupted himself and clapped a hand to his forehead enough any more of his chatter and ill end by believing it come join us he cried unslinging his harp from the tangle of bows quivers of arrows bucklers and leather strapping he bore on his back all friends are met again ill play you a tune to celebrate and keep us warm at the same time cheered by the bards music the companions journeyed on together soon the high fortress of caer dathyl rose golden in the winter sunlight its mighty bastions sprang up like eagles impatient for the sky beyond the walls and circling the fortress stood the camps and flagdecked pavilions of lords come in allegiance to the royal house of don yet it was not the sight of the banners or the windtossed emblems of the golden sunburst that made tarans heart leap but rather the knowledge that the companions and commot warriors had come safe to the end of one journey to warmth and rest for a little time at least safe taran halted in his own thoughts and the memories returned of rhun king of mona who slept silent before the gates of caer cadarn of annlaw clayshaper and his fingers clenched around the fragment of pottery chapter the coming of pryderi caer dathyl was an armed camp where sparks like blazing snowflakes whirled from the armorers forges its widespreading courtyards rang with the ironshod hooves of war horses and the sharp notes of signal horns although the companions were now safe within its walls the princess eilonwy declined to exchange her warriors rough garb for more befitting attire the most she agreed to do and that reluctantly was to wash her hair a few ladies of the court remained the rest having been sent to the protection of the eastern strongholds but eilonwy flatly refused to join them in their spinning and weaving chambers caer dathyl may be the most glorious castle in prydain she declared but court ladies are court ladies wherever you find them and ive had more than my share with queen telerias hen flock listening to their giggling and gossiping why its worse than having your ears tickled with feathers for the sake of being a princess ive been halfdrowned with soapy water and thats quite enough my hair still feels clammy as seaweed as for skirts im comfortable just as i am ive lost all my robes anyway and i certainly shant bother to be measured for others the clothes im wearing will do very nicely no one has considered asking me whether my clothing is suitable glew testily remarked although the former giants garments as far as taran could judge were in better repair than those of the companions but shabby treatment is something ive grown used to in my cavern when i was a giant things were much different generosity alas gone forever now i recall when the bats and i taran had neither strength to dispute eilonwys words nor time to listen to glews gwydion hearing of the companions arrival had summoned taran to the hall of thrones while coll fflewddur and gurgi secured gear and provisions for the warriors who had journeyed with them taran followed a guard to the hall finding gwydion in council with math son of mathonwy taran hesitated to draw closer but math beckoned to him and taran dropped to one knee before the whitebearded ruler the high king touched tarans shoulder with a hand withered but firm and bade him rise not since the battle between the sons of don and the armies of the horned king had taran been in the presence of math son of mathonwy and he saw the years had borne heavily upon the monarch of the royal house the face of math was even more careworn and more deeply furrowed than dallbens upon his brow the gold crown of don seemed a cruel burden yet his eyes were keen and filled with stern pride more than this taran sensed a sorrow so profound that his own heart grieved and he bowed his head face me assistant pigkeeper math commanded in a quiet voice fear not to see what i myself know the hand of death reaches toward mine and i am not loath to clasp it i have long heard the horn of gwyn the hunter that summons even a king to his barrow home with a glad heart would i answer it said math for a crown is a pitiless master harsher than the staff of a pigkeeper while a staff bears up a crown weighs down beyond the strength of any man to wear it lightly what grieves me is not my death but at the end of my life to see blood spilled in the land where i sought only peace you know the history of our royal house how long ago the sons of don voyaged in their golden ships to prydain and how men sought their protection against arawn deathlord who had robbed prydain of its treasures and turned a rich fair land into a fallow field since then the sons of don have stood as a shield against the ravages of annuvin but if the shield now be riven then all shatters with it we will gain victory gwydion said the lord of annuvin stakes all upon this venture but his strength is also his weakness for it may be that if we withstand him his power will shatter forever good tidings as well as bad have reached us gwydion went on for the latter king smoit and his armies are embattled in the valley of ystrad he can not for all his boldness force his way farther northward before the end of winter he serves us well nonetheless since his warriors engage the traitors among the southern lords and keep them from joining arawns other battle hosts the more distant kings in the northern realms come but slowly for winter to them is a sterner enemy than arawn more heartening is word that the armies of the west domains are but a few days march from our stronghold scouts have already sighted them it is a host greater than any ever raised in prydain and lord pryderi himself commands them he has done all i prayed from him and more my only unease is that arawns liegemen may give battle and turn him aside before he reaches caer dathyl but if so we will have warning and our forces will march to relieve him not least among our good tidings gwydion added a smile lightening his drawn and haggard features is the coming of taran of caer dallben and the warriors led from the commots i have counted heavily upon him and shall ask still more gwydion spoke then of the ordering of tarans horsemen and unmounted troops the high king listened closely and nodded his agreement go now to your task said math to taran for the day is come when an assistant pigkeeper must help bear the burden of a king during the days that followed the companions served wherever need arose and as gwydion commanded them even glew shared to some extent in the toil at the forceful insistence of fflewddur fflam and not through his own choice under the watchful eye of hevydd the smith the former giant was set to pumping bellows at the forges where he complained unstintingly of the blisters on his pudgy hands more than a stronghold of war caer dathyl was a place of memory and a place of beauty within its bastions in the farther reaches of one of its many courtyards grew a living glade of tall hemlocks and among them rose mounds of honor to ancient kings and heroes halls of carved and ornamented timbers held panoplies of weapons of long and noble lineage and banners whose emblems were famed in the songs of the bards in other buildings were stored treasures of craftsmanship sent from every cantrev and commot in prydain there taran saw with a twinge of heart a beautifully fashioned wine jar from the hands of annlaw clayshaper the companions when spared from their tasks found much of wonder and delight coll had never before journeyed to caer dathyl and he could not help staring at the archways and towers that seemed to soar higher than the snowcapped mountains beyond the walls handsome enough it all is coll admitted and skillfully worked but the towers make me think my appletrees should have been better pruned and left to itself my garden will yield as much as the stones of this courtyard a man called out to them and beckoned from the doorway of one of the smallest and plainest of the buildings he was tall his face deeply weathered white hair fell straight to his shoulders the coarse cloak of a warrior was flung loosely about him but neither sword nor dagger hung at his unadorned leather belt as the companions followed fflewddur ran instantly to the man and heedless of the snow dropped to one knee before him perhaps it is i who should bow to you fflewddur fflam son of godo said the man smiling and ask your pardon he turned to the companions and offered his hand i know you better than you know me he said and laughed goodheartedly at their surprise my name is taliesin the chief bard of prydain said fflewddur beaming proudly and delightedly made me a gift of my harp i am in his debt of that i am not altogether sure replied taliesin as the companions followed him through the doorway and into a spacious chamber lightly furnished with only a few sturdy seats and benches and a long table of curiously grained wood that glowed in the light of a cheery hearthfire ancient volumes stacks and rolls of parchment crowded the walls and rose high into the shadows of the raftered ceiling yes my friend the chief bard said to fflewddur i have thought often of that gift indeed it has been a little on my conscience he gave the bard a glance that was shrewd but filled with kindness and good humor taran at first had seen taliesin as a man of many years now he could not guess the chief bards age taliesins features though heavily lined seemed filled with a strange mixing of ancient wisdom and youthfulness he wore nothing to betoken his rank and taran realized there was no need for such adornment like adaon his son and tarans companion of long ago his eyes were gray deepset seeming to look beyond what they saw and there was in the chief bards face and voice a sense of authority far greater than a war leaders and more commanding than a kings i knew the nature of the harp when i gave it to you the chief bard continued and knowing your own nature suspected that you would always have some small trouble with the strings trouble cried fflewddur why not a bit of it never for a moment two strings broke with such a twang that gurgi started in alarm fflewddurs face turned bright red to the tip of his nose the fact of the matter is as i stop and think on it the old pots forced me to tell the truth ah shall we say a little more than i normally would but it does occur to me telling the truth has harmed no one least of all myself taliesin smiled then you have learned no small lesson nonetheless my gift was in jest yet not entirely in jest say perhaps the laughter of one heart to another but you have borne it willingly now i offer you any of your choosing he said taliesin pointed to a shelf where stood a number of harps some newer some older and a few even more gracefully curved than the instrument fflewddur carried with a joyful cry fflewddur hastened to them lovingly touching the strings of each admiring the workmanship turning from one to the next and back again he hesitated some while looking dolefully at the newly broken strings of his own instrument at the scratches and chips scarring the frame ah yes well you honor me he murmured in some confusion but this old pot is quite good enough for me there are times i swear when it seems to play of itself none has a better tone when the strings are fixed that is it sits well against my shoulder not to belittle these but what i mean is that somehow were used to each other yes im most grateful but i would not change it so be it then replied taliesin and you others the chief bard added to the companions you have seen many of the treasures of caer dathyl but have you seen its true pride and priceless treasure it is here he said quietly gesturing around the chamber stored in this hall of lore is much of prydains ancient learning though arawn deathlord robbed men of their craft secrets he could not gain the songs and sayings of our bards here they have been carefully gathered of your songs my gallant friend he said to fflewddur there are not a few memory lives longer than what it remembers taliesin said and all men share the memories and wisdom of all others below this chamber lie even richer troves he smiled like poetry itself the greater part is the more deeply hidden there too is the hall of bards alas fflewddur fflam he said regretfully none but a true bard may enter it though one day perhaps you shall join our company oh wisdom of noble bards cried gurgi his eyes popping in wonderment it makes humble gurgis poor tender head spin with whirlings and twirlings alas alas for he has no wisdom but he would go without crunchings and munchings to gain it taliesin put a hand on the creatures shoulder do you believe you have none he asked that is not true of wisdom there are as many patterns as a loom can weave yours is the wisdom of a good and kindly heart scarce it is and its worth all the greater such is that of coll son of collfrewr said the chief bard and added thereto the wisdom of the earth the gift of waking barren ground and causing the soil to flourish in a rich harvest my garden does that labor not i said coll his bald crown turning pink from both pleasure and modesty and as i recall the state i left it in i shall wait long for another harvest whatever i was to gain wisdom on the isle of mona i put in eilonwy thats why dallben sent me there all i learned was needlework cooking and curtsying learning is not the same as wisdom taliesin interrupted with a kindly laugh in your veins princess flows the blood of the enchantresses of llyr your wisdom may be the most secret of all for you know without knowing even as the heart itself knows how to beat alas for my own wisdom said taran i has with your son when he met his death he gave me a brooch of great power and while i wore it there was much i understood and much that was hidden grew dear to me the brooch is no longer mine if indeed it ever truly was what i knew then i remember only as a dream lingering beyond my power to grasp it a shade of sorrow passed over taliesins face there are those he said gently who must first learn loss despair and grief of all paths to wisdom this is the cruelest and longest are you one who must follow such a way this even i can not know if you are take heart nonetheless those who reach the end do more than gain wisdom as rough wool becomes cloth and crude clay a vessel so do they change and fashion wisdom for others and what they give back is greater than what they won taran was about to speak but the notes of a signal horn rang from the middle tower and shouts rose from the guardians at the turrets watchers cried out the sighting of king pryderis battle host taliesin led the companions up a broad flight of stone steps where from atop the hall of lore they could see beyond the walls of the fortress taran could only glimpse the gleam of the westering sun on ranks of spears across the valley then mounted figures broke away from the mass and galloped across the snowflecked expanse against the rolling meadow the leading rider of the band was sharply brilliant in trappings of crimson black and gold and sunlight sparkled on his golden helmet taran could watch no longer for guards were shouting the names of the companions summoning them to the great hall catching up the banner of the white pig gurgi hastened after taran the companions quickly made their way to the great hall a long table had been placed there and at its head sat math and gwydion taliesin took his seat at gwydions left hand to the right of math stood an empty throne draped in the colors of king pryderis royal house on either side sat the lords of don cantrev nobles and war leaders circling the hall stood the bannerbearers gurgi glanced about him in dismay but at a gesture from gwydion stationed himself among their ranks the poor creature looked miserable and frightened out of his wits amid the stern warriors but the companions turned encouraging eyes on him and coll gave him such a huge grin and a wink that gurgi raised both his shaggy head and his makeshift banner more proudly than any in the great hall taran himself felt no little awkwardness when gwydion signaled for him and the others to take seats among the war leaders though eilonwy still in her warriors attire smiled happily and seemed altogether at ease humph she remarked i think hen wen shows up quite handsomely and for the matter of that better than most you were so disagreeable about whether her eyes were blue or brown well i can tell you thats not half as strange as the colors theyve embroidered on some of these banners eilonwy stopped speaking for the portals were flung open and king pryderi entered the great hall all eyes were on him as he strode toward the council table he was as tall as gwydion himself and his rich raiment glittered in the torchlight he wore no helmet what taran had seen was his long hair that shone like gold about his brow at his side hung a naked sword for it was pryderis custom as fflewddur whispered to taran never to sheathe his blade until the battle was won behind him followed falconers with hooded hawks on their gauntleted wrists his war leaders with the crimson hawk emblem of the house of pwyll broidered on their cloaks and spearmen flanking his bannerbearer gwydion clothed like the chief bard in the unadorned garb of a warrior stood to greet him but pryderi halted before reaching the council table and arms folded glanced around the hall at the waiting cantrev kings well met lords pryderi cried i rejoice io see you gathered here the threat of annuvin makes you forget your own quarreling once more you seek protection from the house of don like fledglings who see the hawk circling pryderis voice rang with unhidden scorn taran started at the kings harsh speech the high king himself looked sharply at pryderi though when he spoke his words were measured and grave how then lord pryderi it is i who summoned all who will stand with us for the safety of all hangs in the balance pryderi smiled bitterly his handsome features were flushed whether from the cold or from anger taran could not tell blood tinged pryderis high jutting cheekbones as he threw back his golden head and unflinchingly met the high kings stern glance would any have lingered seeing himself threatened replied pryderi men answer only to an iron fist or a sword at their throats those who bear you allegiance bear it as it serves their own ends among themselves these cantrev rulers are never at peace but each is eager to profit from the weakness of his neighbor in their secret hearts are they less evil than arawn deathlord shocked and angry murmurs arose from the cantrev kings math silenced them with a quick gesture then gwydion spoke it is beyond any mans wisdom to judge the secret heart of another he said for in it are good and evil mixed but these are matters to ponder over the embers of a campfire as you and i have often done or at the end of feasting when the torches burn low our deeds now must safeguard prydain come pryderi son of pwyll your place awaits you and we have many plans to set you summoned me prince of don pryderi answered in a hard voice i am here to join you no to demand your surrender chapter the fortress for an instant none could speak the silver bells at the legs of pryderis hawks tinkled faintly then taran was on his feet sword in hand the cantrev lords shouted in rage and drew their weapons gwydions voice rang out commanding them to silence pryderi did not move his retainers had unsheathed their blades and formed a circle about him the high king had risen from his throne you sport with us son of pwyll math said severely but treachery is no fitting matter for a jest pryderi still stood with arms folded his golden features had turned the color of iron call it no jest he answered and call me no traitor this i have pondered long and closely and with much anguish of heart i see now that only thus can i serve prydain gwydions face was pale and his eyes grave you speak in madness he replied have arawns false promises blinded you to reason would you tell me that a liegeman of the deathlord serves any realm but annuvin to me arawn can promise nothing i do not already have answered pryderi but arawn will do what the sons of don failed to do make an end of endless wars among the cantrevs and bring peace where there was none before the peace of death and the silence of mute slavery gwydion replied pryderi glanced around him a harsh smile was on his lips do these men deserve better lord gwydion are all their lives together worth one of ours crude brawlers these selfstyled cantrev lords are unfit to command even their own households i choose what is best for prydain he continued i do not serve arawn is the axe the woodcutters master at the end it is arawn who will serve me with horror taran listened to the words of pryderi as he spoke to the high king lay down your arms abandon the weaklings who cling to you for protection surrender to me now caer dathyl shall be spared and yourself and those i deem worthy to rule with me math raised his head is there worse evil he said in a low voice his eyes never leaving pryderis is there worse evil than that which goes in the mask of good one of the cantrev lords sprang from the council table and blade upraised started toward pryderi touch him not cried math we welcomed him as a friend he leaves as a foe but he shall leave in safety if any harm even a feather of his hawks his life shall be forfeit go from here pryderi son of pwyll gwydion said the coldness of his tone making his wrath the more terrible the anguish of my heart is no less than yours our comradeship is broken between us there can be only the lines of battle and our only bond the edge of a sword pryderi did not answer but turned on his heel and with his retainers strode from the great hall even as he mounted his steed word spread among the warriors and they stared silently in their ranks beyond the walls the armies of pryderi had lit torches and the valley flamed as far as tarans eyes could see pryderi rode through the gates the crimson and gold of his raiment shimmering like the torches themselves and galloped toward his waiting host taran and the commot men watched sick with despair they knew as did all in caer dathyl this glittering king like a hawk of death had snatched their lives and now bore them away with him gwydion had expected the army of king pryderi to attack at first light and the men in the fortress had labored through the night making ready to withstand a siege when dawn came however and the pale sun rose higher pryderis battle host was seen to have advanced but little from the wall taran fflewddur and coll with the other war leaders watched beside gwydion who stood scanning the valley and the heights that dipped in raw ridges to the flatlands snow had not fallen for some days gullies and rocky fissures still held streaks and patches of white caught among the crevices like tufts of wool but the broad meadowland was for the most part clear the dead turf showed in dark brown splotches under a ragged mantle of frost scouts had brought word that pryderis warriors held the valley in strength and barred passage through the battle lines nevertheless no skirmishers or flanking columns of riders had been seen abroad and the scouts judged from this and the stationing of the foot soldiers and horsemen that the attack would come in a great forward thrust as an iron fist against the gates of caer dathyl gwydion nodded pryderi means to strike in all his might though it will cost him dearly he can be spendthrift of his warriors lives knowing we can ill afford to pay an equal price he frowned and rubbed his chin with the back of a gauntleted hand his green eyes narrowed as he peered across the valley and his lined face was that of a wolf scenting his enemies lord pryderi is arrogant he murmured gwydion turned sharply to the war leaders i will not await a siege to do so would be sure defeat pryderi has numbers enough to flood us like a wave we shall give battle beyond the fortress and we ourselves strike against the wave before it reaches its crest math son of mathonwy shall command the inner defenses only at the last if so it must be shall we retreat into the fortress and make our stand there gwydion looked for a long moment at the halls and towers of the castle which had now caught the early rays of the sun the sons of don raised caer dathyl with their own hands and built it not only as a shield against arawn but as safeguard for the wisdom and beauty of prydain as i would do all in my power to shatter pryderi so would i do all to spare caer dathyl from destruction it may be that we shall gain both these ends or lose both but we must battle not as sluggish oxen but as swift wolves and cunning foxes the prince of don spoke quickly to the war leaders clearly setting forth the tasks of each taran felt uneasy as a boy he had dreamed of taking a mans place among men and as a boy had deemed himself well fit to do so now amid the grizzled battlewise warriors his strength seemed feeble his knowledge clouded coll sensing tarans thoughts winked encouragement at him the stout old farmer taran knew had paid close heed to gwydions words yet taran guessed that a corner of colls heart was distant busily and happily occupied with his turnip patch for much of the morning pryderis host held its position while the defenders quickly formed their own battle lines at some distance beyond the walls of caer dathyl heavily armed fighting men stood ready to bear the brunt of pryderis assault and there gwydion himself would command fflewddur and llyan with taliesin and a company of warriorbards held a post across the valley the commot horsemen would be at the flank of pryderis attack and it would be their task to slash into the onrushing wave to disrupt and sap the strength from the enemys arms taran and coll at the head of one troop and llassar entrusted to lead another galloped to their stations gurgi silent and shivering in his huge jacket drove the banner of the white pig into the frozen ground to mark a rallying point taran felt the eyes of the foe watching every move and an odd impatience mixed with fear drew him taut as a bowstring gwydion astride melyngar rode up for a last glance at the ordering of the commot men and taran cried out to him why does pryderi wait does he mock us are we no more than ants to him laboring at a hill to be crushed at his pleasure patience answered gwydion in a tone that was both the reassurance of a friend and the command of a war leader you are swords added to my hands gwydion went on do not let yourselves be shattered move quickly stay not over long in one fray but start many he took tarans hand and colls and gurgis farewell gwydion said almost brusquely then spun melyngar about and rode siftly to his warriors taran watched him until he had disappeared then turned toward the distant towers of caer dathyl eilonwy along with glew had been commanded to remain in the fortress under the high kings protection taran strained his eyes in the vain hope of glimpsing her on the walls what she might feel for him he was no more sure than he had been at caer dallben but despite his resolve he was on the verge of speaking his own heart fully then suddenly like a man swept away in a flood he had been caught up in the rallying of warriors without even a moment to say his farewell yearning pierced him and regret for his unspoken words was an iron hand gripping his throat he started and clenched the reins as melynlas snorting a white cloud began to paw the ground at a glance he saw pryderis host had risen and was surging into the valley the battle was upon him it came quickly not as the slowcresting wave taran had expected first was a swelling sea of shouting men the sons of don were not awaiting pryderis charge but were racing ahead to grapple with the attacking foe he saw gwydion on the rearing white shape of melyngar but taran could not tell the instant of the first clash of arms for in a moment instead of two tides there was only one that spun and shifted in a great convulsion a whirlpool of spears and swords taran sounded his horn and as an answering shout came from llassar clapped heels into the flanks of melynlas coll and the commot horsemen spurred their mounts after him from a swift canter the powerful legs of melynlas stretched to a gallop the stallions muscles heaved beneath him and taran sword raised plunged into the sea of men his head spun and he gasped as if drowning he realized he was terrified around him swirled the faces of friends and foes he glimpsed llonio flailing right and left the mans makeshift helmet bobbed over his eyes his long legs were drawn up high in the stirrups and he looked like nothing so much as a scarecrow come to life yet where llonio passed attackers fell as wheat to a scythe hevydds burly frame rose like a wall in the midst of the combat of llassar there was no sign but taran thought he could hear the young shepherds highpitched battle cry then a furious roaring reached his ears and he knew llyan with fflewddur had entered the fray in another moment aware of nothing beyond the blade in his hand taran was locked in a blind madness with warriors who thrust at him and whose blows he strove to return again and again taran and the commot horsemen slashed deep into the attackers flanks then wheeled to gallop free of the iron whirlpool only to plunge back again in a flash of clarity taran saw glittering gold and crimson it was king pryderi on a black charger taran struggled to engage him for an instant their eyes met but the son of pwyll made no attempt to answer the challenge of a ragged horseman instead he looked away and continued to press ahead then he was gone and it was pryderis scornful glance that stung taran more sharply than the blade which swung up from the mass of foemen to lash across his face once the swell of the armed tide flung taran to the fringes of the battle he caught sight of gurgis banner and tried to rally the horsemen around it a trough had opened up amid pryderis ranks in another moment a horse pounded toward him lluagor a warrior armed with a long lance clung to the steeds back go back taran shouted at the top of his voice have you lost your wits eilonwy for it was she halfhalted she had tucked her plaited hair under a leather helmet the princess of llyr smiled cheerfully at him i understand youre upset she shouted back but thats no cause to be rude she galloped on for a time taran could not believe he had really seen her moments later he was struggling against a band of warriors who slashed at melynlas threw themselves against the stallions flanks and strove to bear down horse and rider taran was vaguely aware of someone seizing his mounts bridle and dragging him to the side pryderis warriors fell away free of the press he turned in the saddle and blindly flung up his sword against the new attacker it was coll the stout farmer had lost his helmet his bald crown was as scratched as if he had plunged headlong into briars save your sword for your foes not your friends he cried tarans surprise left him speechless an instant before he stammered you saved my life son of collfrewr why so perhaps i did replied coll as though the idea had suddenly come to him they looked at each other and burst out laughing like a pair of fools only toward sundown when the sky itself seemed streaked with blood did taran gain a new sense of the battle gwydions warriors flung across the path of pryderis advance had met the full fury of their attackers the hosts of pryderi had faltered as though stumbling over their own dead the wave had crested and hung poised now a fresh wind surged over the valley tarans heart leaped as shouts of renewed strength rang from the warriors of don they pressed onward driving all before them taran sounded his horn and with the commot horsemen galloped to join the sweeping tide the ranks of the enemy parted like a shattered wall taran clutched at his reins melynlas reared and whinnied in alarm a shudder of horror racked the valley taran saw and understood why even before the rising current of outcries reached his ears the cauldronborn the deathless warriors the men of pryderi fell back to let them pass as if in fearful homage in ghastly silence their pace neither fast nor slow the cauldronborn filled the breach and the valley rang with the tread of their heavy boots in the crimson haze of the dying sun their faces seemed all the more livid their eyes were cold and dull as stones unfaltering the column of deathless warriors bore toward caer dathyl among them slung about with ropes they carried an ironcapped battering ram the foemen flanking the cauldronborn now turned suddenly to launch a fresh attack against the sons of don in horror taran realized why pryderi had delayed and understood his arrogance only now had the traitor kings plan reached its fulfillment behind the long column of cauldronborn fresh fighting men streamed from the heights for pryderi the long day of battle had been no more than a mockery the slaughter had begun at the fortress bowmen and spearmen of the inner defenses thronged the walls the mute cauldronborn did not falter in the storm of arrows though every shaft found its mark the foe moved steadily onward pausing only to rip the arrows from their unbleeding flesh their features showed neither pain nor anger and no human cry no shout of triumph passed their lips from annuvin they had journeyed as though from the grave their task only to bring death unpitying implacable as their own lifeless faces against the pounding of the battering ram the gates of caer dathyl groaned and trembled the massive hinges loosened while echoes of the driving ram shuddered through the fortress the portal splintered the first breach gaped like a wound the cauldronborn gathered strength once more to force the ram forward the gates of caer dathyl shattered and fell inward trapped between the ranks of pryderis warriors the sons of don fought vainly to reach the fortress sobbing with fury and despair taran helpless saw the cauldronborn stride past the broken gates before them stood math the high king he was attired in the raiment of the royal house belted with links of gold and on his brow glittered the gold crown of don about his shoulders was a cloak of fine white wool wrapped as though it were a burial garment outstretched his withered hand gripped a naked sword the deathless warriors of annuvin halted as if at the faint stirring of some clouded memory the moment passed and they strode on the field of battle was silent now an awed hush had fallen even upon the men of pryderi the high king did not turn away as the cauldronborn drew closer his eyes fixed theirs as he raised his sword defiantly unflinching he stood in pride and ancient majesty the first of the pallid warriors was upon him grasping the flashing sword in his frail hands the high king swung it downward in a sweeping blow the warriors blade turned it aside and the cauldronborn struck heavily king math staggered and dropped to one knee the mass of mute warriors pressed forward their weapons thrusting and slashing taran covered his face with his hands and turned away weeping as math son of mathonwy fell and the ironshod boots of the cauldronborn pressed their relentless march over his lifeless body from the dark hills then there rose the long notes of a hunting horn trembling echoing among the crags and a shadow seemed to brush the sky above the fortress now behind the cauldronborn the men of pryderi streamed through the broken gates while waves of attackers drove the remnants of gwydions army into the heights scattering them amid snowfilled gullies from caer dathyl came new claps of thunder as the ram of the cauldronborn turned against the walls to breach them in turn flames rose above the great hall above the hall of lore and from the middle tower was unfurled the crimson hawk of pryderi beside it blotting out the dying sun spread the black banner of arawn lord of annuvin caer dathyl had fallen chapter the red fallows all night the destruction raged and by morning caer dathyl lay in ruins fires smouldered where once had stood the lofty halls the swords and axes of the cauldronborn had leveled the hemlock grove near the mounds of honor in the dawn light the shattered walls seemed bloodstained the army of pryderi denying even the right of burial for the slain had driven the defenders into the hills east of caer dathyl it was there amid the turmoil of the makeshift camp the companions found one another again faithful gurgi still bore the banner of the white pig though its staff had been broken and the emblem slashed almost beyond recognition llyan with fflewddur beside her crouched in the scant shelter of a rocky outcropping her tail twitched and her yellow eyes still glowed with anger hevydd the smith built a campfire and taran eilonwy and coll tried to warm themselves at the embers llassar though sorely wounded had lived through the battle but the enemy had taken cruel toll of the commot men among those who lay stark and silent on the trampled battleground was llonio son of llonwen one of the handful of survivors from the inner defenses of the fortress was glew a warrior of don finding him lost and dazed outside the walls had taken pity on his plight and brought him to the camp the former giant was pathetically glad to rejoin the companions though he was still too terrified and trembling to do more than mumble a few words with a torn cloak over his shoulders he huddled beside the fire and held his head in his hands gwydion stood alone for long his eyes did not leave the column of black smoke staining the sky above the ruins of caer dathyl at last he turned away and ordered all who had lived out the day to assemble taliesin came to stand before them and taking up fflewddurs harp sang a lament for the slain amid the black pines the voice of the chief bard rose in deep sorrow yet it was sorrow without despair and while the notes of the harp were heavy laden with mourning they held as well the clear strains of life and hope as the melody died away taliesin lifted his head and spoke quietly each broken stone of caer dathyl shall be a mark of honor and the whole valley a resting place for math son of mathonwy and all our dead but a high king still lives as i honor him so do i honor all who stand with him he turned to gwydion and bowed deeply the warriors drew their swords and cried out the name of the new king of prydain gwydion then called the companions to him we meet only to part he said pryderis victory gives us one choice and one hope though messengers bear tidings of our defeat to king smoit and his army and to the lords of the north we dare not await their help what we do must be done now not even a battle host tenfold greater than pryderis can withstand the cauldronborn army after army can be flung against them only to swell the ranks of the slain yet here is the seed of our hope gwydion said never in mans memory has arawn sent his deathless warriors abroad in such strength he has taken the greatest risk for the greatest gain and he has triumphed but his triumph has become his moment of greatest weakness without the cauldronborn to guard it annuvin lies open to attack so must we attack it do you believe then that annuvin is unguarded taran asked quickly are there none other who serve arawn mortal warriors surely replied gwydion and perhaps a force of huntsmen but we have strength to overcome them if the cauldronborn do not reach annuvin in time to aid them gwydions bloodstreaked face was hard as stone they must not reach annuvin as their power dwindles the longer they remain beyond the deathlords realm so at all cost must they be hindered delayed turned from every path they follow coll nodded indeed this is our only hope whatever and it must be done quickly for now they will seek to return quickly to their master but can we overtake them once they are on the march can we hinder them and at the same time mount our own attack against annuvin not if we journey as one army gwydion said instead we must separate into two bands the first and smaller shall be given as many horses as can be spared and hasten to pursue the cauldronborn the second shall make their way to the valley of kynvael and follow its river northwest to the coast the valley land is gentle and with forced marches the sea can be reached in no more than two days the sea must aid our venture gwydion continued for pryderi can too easily forbid our armys journey overland he turned to taran math son of mathonwy spoke to you of the ships that bore the sons of don from the summer country these vessels were not abandoned still seaworthy they have ever been held ready against a day of need a faithful folk guard them in a hidden harbor near the mouth of the river kynvael they will carry us to the western shore of prydain close to the bastions of annuvin itself two men alone have knowledge of the harbor gwydion added one was math son of mathonwy the other is myself i have no choice but to lead the seaward march as for the other journey he said to taran will you accept to lead it taran raised his head i serve as you command i do not command this replied gwydion i order no man to such a task against his will and all who follow you must do so willingly then it is my will to do so taran answered the companions murmured their assent the vessels of the sons of don are swift gwydion said i ask you to delay the cauldronborn but a little while yet all hangs on that little if i fail taran said how shall i send word to you should the cauldron warriors reach annuvin ahead of you your plan can not succeed and you must turn back gwydion shook his head there can be no turning back for there is no further hope should either of us fail all our lives are forfeit llassar hevydd and all the other commot folk chose to follow taran with them were joined the surviving warriors of fflewddur fflam and together they made the greater portion of tarans band to the surprise of the companions glew chose to ride with them the former giant had recovered from his fright at least enough to regain much of his customary peevishness he had however regained all of his appetite and demanded food in great quantity from gurgis wallet of provisions ive had my fill of being dragged here and there by the scruff of the neck said glew licking his fingers and now im either to be put on a ship or cast among a herd of horses very well i shall take the latter for at least its not so wet and salty but i assure you i would have agreed to neither when i was a giant fflewddur glowered at the former giant and spoke apart with taran it seems were doomed on top of all our other woes to put up with that whining weasel at every step and i cant help feeling that in the back of that puny little mind hes hoping somehow to feather his own nest the bard shook his head and gave taran a sorrowful look but are any nests left to feather theres not a safe place even for glew to hide his head gurgi had tied the banner of the white pig to a new staff but he sighed mournfully at the tattered emblem poor piggy he cried none can see her now for she is torn into threadings and shreddings i promise to sew another eilonwy said as soon as she stopped abruptly and said no more as she climbed astride lluagor taran saw her troubled glance the princess of llyr would wait long he feared before her hands worked with an embroidery needle and unspoken but in his heart was the dread that none of them might see caer dallben again at the end of their grim race death might be the only prize armed with spears and swords the warriors were mounted and ready with a last farewell to gwydion the companions rode westward from the hills it was colls judgment that the cauldronborn would march directly to annuvin following the straightest and shortest path at the head of the column winding its way from the snowswept heights llassar rode beside taran the skill of the young shepherd eased their passage and he guided them swiftly toward the lowlands unseen by pryderis army which had begun to withdraw from the valley around caer dathyl for some days they journeyed and taran began to fear the retreating cauldronborn had outdistanced them nevertheless they could do no more than press on as quickly as possible southward now passing through long stretches of sparse woodland it was gurgi who first sighted the deathless warriors the creatures face went gray with fright as he pointed to an expanse of rockstrewn plain glew blinked choked and could barely swallow the food he was munching eilonwy watched silently and the bard gave a low whistle of dismay tarans heart sank at the sight of the column moving like a long serpent over the flatlands he turned questioningly to coll can we hold them off at all a pebble can turn aside an avalanche said coll or a twig stem a flood i daresay muttered fflewddur what happens to the twig or pebble afterward i should rather not think about taran was about to signal the warriors to form for an attack but coll took his arm not yet my boy he said first i would be sure of the path these creatures of arawn mean to follow to annuvin if the twig is to do its work it must be well placed for the rest of that day and the morning of the next the companions matched their own progress with the march of the cauldronborn sometimes ahead sometimes along their flank but never losing sight of the deathless warriors it seemed to taran that the cauldronborn had slowed their pace the dark column moved without faltering but heavily as though burdened he spoke of this to coll who nodded in satisfaction their strength ebbs a little coll said time works for us but i think we must soon work for ourselves they had reached a broad winding belt of wasteland where grassless earth stretched away on either side as far as the eye could see the dead ground was broken rutted as though illplowed slashed with deep ditches and gullies no tree no shrub rose from the dull red earth and nowhere did taran see the faintest sign that any growing thing had ever flourished there he looked at it uneasily chilled not only by the bitter wind but by the silence that hovered like frozen mist about the lifeless land he asked in a low voice what place is this coll grimaced the red fallows it is called now at the moment he added wryly i fear it is much the way my garden looks i have heard it spoken of taran said though i believed to be it no more than a travelers tale coll shook his head no travelers tale whatever men have long shunned it yet once it was the fairest realm in prydain the land was such that all manner of things would grow as if overnight grains vegetables fruits why in size and savor the apples from the orchards here would have made mine look like shriveled windfalls beside them a prize it was to be won and held and many lords fought for its possession but in the fighting over it year after year the hooves of steeds trampled the ground the blood of warriors stained it in time the land died as did those who strove to claim it from their fellows and soon its blight crept far beyond the battle grounds coll sighed i know this land my boy and it does not please me to see it again in my younger days i too marched with the battle hosts and left not a little of my own blood in the fallows will they never flourish taran asked looking with dismay at the wasted expanse prydain could be a rich land with the abundance they might bear it would be a shame worse than bloodshed to leave these fields thus would the soil not yield again if it were labored well who can say answered coll perhaps no man has tilled it for years long past but for us now that is all bytheby he gestured toward the heights rising sharply at the distant edge of the fields the red fallows stretch along the hills of brangaledd southwestward almost to annuvin from here it is the longest but easiest path to arawns realm and if i judge aright the cauldronborn will follow it swiftly to their master we must not let them pass taran replied here we must make our first stand and hinder them as best we can he glanced toward the heights we must force them into the hills among rocks and broken ground we might set snares or lure them into ambush it is all we can hope to do perhaps said coll though before you choose know this the hills of brangaledd also give a path to annuvin and a shorter one they rise sharper as they go westward and turn soon to steep crags there stands mount dragon the highest peak guarding the iron portals of the land of death it is a harsh passage cruel and dangerous more so for us than for the deathless cauldronborn we can lose our lives they can not taran frowned anxiously then said with a bitter laugh indeed there is no happy choice old friend the path of the red fallows is easier but longer the mountain way harder and shorter he shook his head i have not the wisdom to decide have you no counsel for me the choice must be yours war leader answered coll yet as a grower of turnips and cabbages i might say if you trust your strength the mountains may be friend as much as foe taran smiled at him sorrowfully little trust do i put in the strength of an assistant pigkeeper alone he said after a long moment but much in the strength and wisdom of his companions so be it we must drive the cauldron warriors into the hills know this too said coll if such is your choice it must be done at this place and at all cost farther southward the fallows widen the plain grows broad and flat and there is danger the cauldronborn may escape our reach if we fail here taran grinned now that is simple enough for an assistant pigkeeper to understand taran rode back through the column of warriors to tell them of the plan they were to follow though he cautioned eilonwy and gurgi to hold themselves as far as possible from the fray he could judge with little difficulty that the princess of llyr had no intention of heeding his warning as for taran himself the decision he had taken lay heavily on him his doubts and fears only sharpened as the horsemen rallied at the fringe of woodland and as the moment for their advance across the fallows drew closer he felt cold the wind muttering across the rutted fields seeped through his cloak like an icy flood he caught sight of coll who winked at him and nodded his bald crown in a quick gesture taran raised the horn to his lips and signaled the warriors forward at colls counsel the companions and each horseman had cut stout branches from the trees now like ants burdened with straws the column entered the wasteland struggling across the ruts and gullies to their right rose the ruins of a wall some ancient boundary useless now whose broken slabs stretched over much of the fallows width and ended near the steep ascent of the brangaledd hills it was there that taran with all haste led the toiling band of warriors the cauldronborn it seemed to him had already glimpsed them for the dark column quickened its own pace thrusting rapidly across the fallows tarans horsemen had dismounted and raced to fling their branches between the gaps in the wall the column of cauldronborn marched closer beside them rode mounted huntsmen garbed in heavy jackets of wolfskin the troop captains whose harsh commands reached tarans ears like the snapping of a lash their orders rang in a language unknown to him but taran well understood their scornful tone and the brutal laughter that spat from their lips as at caer dathyl the cauldronborn held their ranks striding onward unwavering they had drawn their swords from their belts of heavy bronze the bronze studs covering their leather breastplates glinted dully their pallid faces were frozen as empty as their staring eyes suddenly the horns of the captains screamed like hawks the cauldron warriors stiffened and in another moment lunged forward at a faster gait running heavily across the dark red earth the men of the commots leaped to their makeshift barrier of rocks and branches the cauldronborn flung themselves against the ruined wall and strove to clamber upwards fflewddur leaving llyan with glew amid the other steeds had snatched up a long branch and shouting at the top of his voice thrust it like a spear into the mass of climbing warriors beside him gurgi flailed a huge staff striking desperately at the rising wave heedless of tarans warning outcry eilonwy plied her spear and it was under her furious onslaught that the first cauldron warrior toppled and fell struggling to regain his footing amid the ranks that streamed silently over him tarans band redoubled their efforts slashing sweeping fending off the mute foe with all their strength others among the deathless troops lost their footing as the surging attackers threw themselves blindly against the barrier only to be struck down by the lashing staves and spear shafts of the commot men they fear us cried the bard in frenzied joy see they turn away if we cant slay them great belin we can still push them back in the turmoil of warriors and the shrilling of the huntsmens horns taran glimpsed the ranks of cauldronborn veer from the threatening hedge of spears his heart leaped were the captains indeed fearful of the hindrance of the waning power of their mute host even now the attacking wave seemed weaker though he could not be sure that it was no more than his hope that made it appear so no longer was he even sure how long they struggled at the wall wearied by the endless thrusts of his spear he felt it had been forever although the sky was still light of a sudden he realized fflewddur was right the silent mass of deathless warriors had fallen back the huntsmen captains had taken their decision like beasts that find their prey too well hidden and unworthy of their efforts the mounted leaders sounded a long wavering note on their horns the ranks of cauldronborn swung toward the hills of brangaledd cheers burst from the commot warriors taran spun about to find coll but the old warrior was hastening farther along the wall taran cried out to him then in dismay realized what coll had seen a band of cauldronborn had broken from the main force and now strove to clamber through an undefended breach coll reached it as the first cauldron warrior had begun to force himself over the stones the old man was upon him in an instant and dropping his spear seized the warrior in his burly arms and flung him downward while other cauldronborn swarmed to the breach coll snatched out his sword and laid about him right and left heedless of the attackers hacking and stabbing blades shouting in wrath as the a weapon shattered in his hands the stout farmer cast it away and struck out with his heavy fists the deathless warriors clung to him striving to pull him into their midst but he shook them off ripped a sword from the grasp of a tottering cauldronborn and swung it as if he meant to fell an oak with a single blow taran was at colls side in a moment the horns of the huntsmen screamed the signal to retreat now taran realized the attack had truly ended with this last convulsion the cauldronborn had begun to scale the heights the red fallows were barred to them coll was bleeding heavily from the head his fleecelined coat bloodsoaked was slashed and tattered by the blades of the cauldronborn quickly taran and fflewddur carried him between them to the bottom of the wall gurgi whimpering in distress hurried to aid them eilonwy had torn off her cloak to cushion the old farmer against the harsh stones after them my boy coll gasped give them no rest the twigs have turned the flood but it must be turned again and many times if you would block the way to annuvin one stout oak tree has turned it taran replied once again i have leaned on it he took colls workhardened hands and gently tried to lift him colls broad face grinned and he shook his head i am a farmer he murmured but warrior enough to know my own death wound go along my boy carry with you no more burdens than you must what then answered taran will you have me break the promise i made that we will dig and weed together but the words came painfully as a dagger wound eilonwy her face drawn looked anxiously at taran i had hoped one day to sleep in my own garden coll said the drone of bees would have pleased me more than the horn of gwyn the hunter but i see the choice was not to be mine the horn of gwyn does not blow for you said taran you hear the cauldronborn summoned to retreat yet even as he spoke the faint notes of a horn rose above the hills and its dying echoes trembled like shadows over the wasteland eilonwy covered her face with her hands see to our plantings my boy said coll we shall both do so answered taran the weeds will no more stand against you than did arawns warriors the stout old farmer did not answer it was a long moment before taran realized that coll was dead while the grieving companions gathered stones from the ruined wall with his own hands taran hollowed out a grave in the harsh earth allowing none other to aid him in this task even when the humble mound had risen above coll son of collfrewr he did not move from it but ordered fflewddur and the companions to press on into the hills of brangaledd where he would join them before nightfall for long he stood silently as the sky darkened at last he turned away and climbed heavily astride melynlas he halted another moment by the mound of red earth and rough stones sleep well grower of turnips and gatherer of apples taran murmured you are far from where you longed to be so too am i alone he rode across the darkening fallows to the waiting hills chapter darkness in the days that followed the companions strove to overtake the cauldronborn and again fling themselves across the path of the retreating warriors but their progress was agonizingly slow taran knew coll had spoken truly when he had called the hills of brangaledd both friend and foe the rocky troughs and narrow defiles the sudden drops where the ground fell away sharply into frozen gorges offered the companions their only hope of delaying the deathless host moving onward like a river of iron but at the same time from the high crags of the west gusts of snowladen wind battered the struggling band with icy hammers the winding trails were slippery and treacherous the ravines held deep pits filled with snow where horse and rider might founder beyond rescue in the hills tarans most trusted guide was llassar surefooted long used to mountain ways the commot youth was now shepherd to a different grimmer flock more than once llassars keen senses kept the companions from the icy traps of snowhidden crevices and he discovered pathways no other eye could see but the progress of the ragged band was nonetheless slow and all suffered cruelly from the cold men and animals alike only the great cat llyan showed no concern for the bitter blasts that drove frosty needles against the faces of the companions she seems to be enjoying herself fflewddur sighed huddling in his cloak he had been obliged to dismount for llyan had suddenly taken it into her head to sharpen her huge claws against a tree trunk and so should i he added if i had her coat gurgi ruefully agreed since entering the hills the poor creature had grown more and more to resemble a drift of hairy snow the cold had even stopped glews endless whining the former giant pulled his hood over his face and little could be seen of him but the frostbitten end of his flabby nose eilonwy too was unwontedly silent her heart taran knew was as heavy as his own yet taran forced himself as far as he was able to put grief aside his dogged pursuit had at last brought his warriors within striking distance of the cauldronborn and now he thought only of the means to slow their march to annuvin as at the red fallows the companions labored to build barriers of tree limbs and set them across a narrow gorge toiling until the sweat drenched their garments and froze in the bitter wind this time the livid warriors overran them mutely hacking away the branches with their swords in despair the men of the commots clashed handtohand with the oncoming foe but the cauldronborn slashed mercilessly through their ranks taran and the commot men sought to block the way with heavy boulders but even with the help of hevydds mighty arms this labor was beyond their strength and the toll of the slain only rose higher the days were a white nightmare of snow and wind the nights were frozen with hopelessness and like exhausted animals the companions found respite amid rocky overhangs and the scant shelter of the mountain passes yet concealment served little purpose the presence of the commot warriors was known and their movements quickly sighted by the enemy captains at first the cauldronborn had chosen to disregard the ragged band now the deathless marchers not only quickened their pace they swung closer to tarans riders as though eager to join battle this puzzled fflewddur who rode beside taran at the head of the column taran frowned and shook his head grimly i understand it all too well he said their power had waned when they were farther from annuvin closer it returns to them and as we grow weaker they grow stronger unless we halt them one time for all our efforts will do no more than sap our own strength soon he added bitterly we shall defeat ourselves more sharply than arawns warriors could ever hope to do but he said nothing of another fear that lay in all their hearts each passing day showed more clearly the cauldron born were turning south away from the hills of brangaledd and once again toward the swifter easier way of the red fallows with dour satisfaction taran judged this to mean the enemy still feared the pursuers and would strive to any lengths to be rid of them snow fell that night and the companions halted blinded by the whirling flakes and by their own weariness before dawn the cauldronborn attacked their camp at first taran believed only one company of the mute warriors had overrun his outposts as the commot warriors sprang to arms amid the terrified shrieking of horses and the clang of blades he quickly realized the entire enemy column was slashing across his lines he spurred melynlas into the fray fflewddur with glew clinging to his waist was astride llyan who sped in great bounds to join the embattled defenders taran had lost sight of eilonwy and gurgi among the rush of warriors like a ruthless sword the cauldronborn had split the commot horsemens ranks and were streaming through unhindered crushing all who stood against them all day the uneven battle raged while the men of the commots struggled vainly to rally their forces by dusk the path of the cauldronborn was a bloody wake of wounded and slain in one deadly blow the cauldron host had broken free of their pursuers to move swiftly and unfaltering from the hills eilonwy and gurgi were missing fearful and dismayed taran and fflewddur pressed their way through the shattered remnants of the war band struggling to regain their ranks torches had been lit to signal rallying points for the stragglers who stumbled wounded and bewildered among the bodies of their fallen comrades throughout the night taran searched frantically sounding his horn and shouting the names of the lost companions with fflewddur he had ridden beyond the battleground hoping for some sign of either one of them there was none and the new snowfall which began toward dawn covered all tracks by midmorning the survivors had gathered the passage of the cauldronborn had taken heavy toll of both mounts and men of the commot warriors one out of three had fallen beneath the swords of the deathless foe and of the steeds more than half lluagor galloped emptysaddled eilonwy and gurgi were among neither the slain nor the living desperate now taran made ready to search through the farther hills but fflewddur his face grave and filled with concern took tarans arm and drew him back alone you cant hope to find them warned the bard neither can you spare time nor men for a search party if were to stop those foul brutes before they reach the fallows we shall have to move with all speed your commot friends are ready to march you and llassar must lead them taran replied once eilonwy and gurgi are found well join you somehow go quickly we shall meet soon again the bard shook his head if thats your command so be it but as i have heard it taran wanderer it was who called the commot folk to his banner and for the sake of taran wanderer they answered they followed where you led for none other would they have done as much what then taran cried would you have me leave eilonwy and gurgi in danger it is a heavy choice fflewddur said alas none can lighten it for you taran did not reply fflewddurs words grieved him all the more because of their truth hevydd and llassar had asked no more than to fight at his side llonio had given his life at caer dathyl there was no commot warrior who had not lost kinsman or comrade if he left them to seek eilonwy would she herself deem his choice good the horsemen awaited his orders melynlas impatiently pawed the ground if eilonwy and gurgi are slain taran said in an anguished voice they are beyond my help if they live i must hope and trust they will find their way to us he swung heavily into the saddle if they live he murmured without daring a backward glance at the silent empty hills he rode toward the war band by the time the commot men were on the march again the cauldronborn had well outdistanced them and were moving without delay to the foothills of brangaledd even at their fastest pace halting only for moments of fitful rest the commot riders regained little of the precious time that had been lost each day taran strained his eyes for a sign of eilonwy and gurgi hoping against hope that the princess would find some means of reaching the war band again but the two companions had vanished and fflewddurs desperate cheerfulness and assurance that both would appear from one moment to the next rang false and hollow at midmorning on the third day of their march an outrider galloped in with tidings of strange movements in the pine forest at the columns flank taran halted his warriors hastily ordering them to stand ready for combat then rode with fflewddur to see for himself through the trees a little below him he could make out no more than a vague stirring as if shadows of branches flickered across the drifts but in another instant the bard shouted excitedly and taran quickly sounded his horn from the woods tramped a long procession of short stocky figures garbed in white cloaks and hoods they were all but invisible against the snow and not until they had begun to move across a bare stretch of rocky ground could taran distinguish one marcher from the next their stout leather boots laced and bound with thongs barely showed below their cloaks and looked like nothing so much as rapidly moving tree stumps the shapes that bulked on their shoulders or at their waists were taran guessed weapons or sacks of provisions great belin cried fflewddur if thats who i think it is taran had already dismounted and was racing down the slope waving at the bard to follow him at the head of the band which seemed to number well over a hundred trudged a familiar stumpy figure though he too was heavily muffled in white his crimson hair flamed out beyond the fringe of his hood in one hand he carried a short heavybladed axe and in the other a thick staff he had caught sight of taran and fflewddur and strode to meet them in another instant the bard and taran were clasping his hands pummeling his burly shoulders and shouting so many greetings and questions that the new arrival clapped his hands to his head doli taran cried good old doli i heard you clearly the first few times the dwarf snorted if i ever doubted you recognized me youve fully convinced me that you do he put his hands on his hips and looked up sharply trying as always to appear as gruff as he could despite himself his bright red eyes flashed with pleasure and his features broke into a grin which he tried without success to change to his usual scowl youve led us a chase doli declared motioning the warriors to follow taran up the slope we had word youd gone into the hills but saw nothing of you until today doli taran exclaimed still amazed at the unexpected sight of this longabsent companion what good luck brings you to us good luck grumbled doli do you call tramping day and night in snow and wind good luck all of us fair folk are abroad one place or another orders of king eiddileg mine were to find you and put myself at your service no offense but i could guess that if anybody in prydain needed help it would turn out to be you so here we are gwystyl has done his work well taran said we knew he was journeying to your realm but we feared king eiddileg might not heed him i cant say he was overjoyed doli answered in fact he nearly burst i was there when our gloomy friend brought word of your plight and i thought my ears would split with eiddilegs bellowing great gawks lumbering oafs giant clodpoles all his usual opinions about humans but he agreed willingly enough despite his bluster hes really fond of you no matter what he says above all he remembers how you saved the fair folk from being turned into frogs moles and whatever it was the greatest service any mortal ever did for us and eiddileg means to repay the debt yes the fair folk are on the march doli continued alas we came too late to caer dathyl but king smoit has cause to thank us theres a host of fair folk fighting side by side with him the northern lords are ready for battle and well take a hand in that too you can be sure doli for all his gruffness was obviously proud of his own tidings he had finished with great relish an account of one fray in which the fair folk had baffled the enemy by making an entire valley so resound with echoes that the foe fled in terror believing themselves surrounded and had begun another tale of fair folk valor when he stopped abruptly seeing the look of concern on tarans face doli listened while taran told what had befallen the other companions and it was the dwarfs turn to be grave and thoughtful when taran finished doli did not reply for a time as for eilonwy and gurgi the dwarf said at last i agree with fflewddur theyll manage somehow and if i know the princess i wouldnt be surprised to see her galloping up at the head of her own army with the cauldronborn were all in bad straits doli continued even we fair folk can do little against such creatures all the tricks that would gull a common mortal are useless the cauldronborn arent human i should say theyre less than human theyve no memory of what they were no fear no hope nothing can touch them the dwarf shook his head and i see that any victory we might gain elsewhere would be wasted unless we find some way to deal with that spawn of annuvin gwydion is quite right if they arent stopped well my friends among us well have to do it and thats flat by this time the fair folk band had reached tarans lines and a murmur of wonder spread through the ranks of the commot men all had heard of the skill and prowess of king eiddilegs fighting forces but none had seen them face to face hevydd the smith marveled at their axes and short swords pronouncing them sharper and better tempered than any he could make for their own part the fair folk seemed not the least uneasy the tallest of eiddilegs warriors stood barely higher than lassars knee but the fair folk soldiers looked on their human comrades with the friendly indulgence they might show to overgrown children doli patted llyans head and the huge animal purred happily in recognition the sight of glew hunched on a rock and staring sourly at the new arrivals brought a cry of surprise from the crimsonhaired dwarf whoever or whatever is that its too big for a toadstool and too small for anything else im glad you asked replied glew its a tale im sure you will find most interesting i was once a giant and my present unhappy state comes no more and no less from a complete lack of concern from those he looked dourly at taran and the bard who might have been expected to show at least a small amount of consideration my kingdom yes i would appreciate it if you addressed me as king glew was the finest cavern with the finest bats on the isle of mona a cavern so vast fflewddur clapped his hands to his ears leave off giant enough weve no time for your prattle about caverns and bats we know youve been illused youve told us so yourself believe me a fflam is patient but if i could find a cavern id pop you into it and leave you there dolis face had turned deeply thoughtful caverns the dwarf muttered he snapped his fingers caverns hear me well he said quickly no more than a days march from here yes im sure of it theres a fair folk mine the best gems and precious stones are gone and eiddilegs had no one working there as long as i can remember but i think we can get into it of course if we follow the main shaft it should bring us out almost at the edge of the red fallows youll catch up with the cauldronborn in no time at all with all our warriors together well stop them one way or another how i dont know that doesnt matter for the moment well cross that bridge when we come to it doli grinned broadly my friends youre with fair folk now when we do something its done right the first half of your worries are over the second half he added might be something else again for the first time since leaving caer dallben glew appeared in good spirits the idea of anything resembling a cavern seemed to cheer him although the result of his improved temper was a further spate of rambling tales about his own feats as a giant however after a hard day and night of marching when doli halted at the sheer face of a high cliff the former giant began glancing about fearfully his nose twitched and his eyes blinked in dismay the entrance to the ancient mine toward which the dwarf beckoned was no more than a fissure in the rock barely wide enough for the horses overhung with icicles glistening like sharp teeth no no stammered glew this doesnt compare with my realm on mona not half the size no you cant expect me to go stumbling around a shabby den like this he would have drawn back had not fflewddur taken him by the collar and dragged him along have done giant cried the bard in you go with the rest of us but fflewddur himself seemed none too eager to lead llyan through the rocky crevice a fflam is valiant he murmured but ive never been fond of underground passages and all such no luck with them mark my words well be grubbing like moles before were through at the mouth of the cavern taran halted beyond this point there was no hope of finding eilonwy once more he battled the wish of his heart to seek her again before she would be forever lost to him with all his strength he fought to wrench these thoughts from his mind but when at last he ruthlessly forced himself to follow the bard it was as though he had left all of himself behind he stumbled blindly into the darkness at dolis orders the warriors had fashioned torches these they now lit and in the flickering light taran saw the dwarf had brought them into a shaft that dipped gradually downward its walls of living rock rose no higher than tarans upraised hands dismounted the commot men led their fearful horses past sharp outcroppings and over broken stones this doli explained was not the mine itself but only one of many sidetunnels the fair folk had used when carrying sacks of gems above ground indeed as the dwarf foretold the passageway soon grew much wider and the rocky ceiling soared three times tarans height narrow platforms of wood one above the other followed the walls on either side though many had fallen into disrepair and the beams had tumbled in a heap over the earthen floor lengths of halfrotted timbers shored up the archways leading from one gallery to the next but of these some had partly crumbled forcing warriors and steeds to pick their way most cautiously over or around the piles of rubble the air was stifling after the icy wind above ground and hung heavy with ancient dust and decay echoes flitted like bats through the longabandoned chambers as the war band moved in a wavering file with torches raised high above their heads the twisting shadows seemed to muffle the sound of their footsteps only the piercing whinny of a frightened steed broke the silence glew who had not left off his complaining since entering the mine gave a sharp cry of surprise he stooped and snatched something from the ground in the flare of his torch taran saw the former giant held a glittering gem as big as a fist fflewddur had seen it too and he sternly ordered put that down little man this is a fair folk trove not that batridden cave of yours glew clutched his find to his chest its mine he squealed none of you saw it if you had youd have kept it for yourselves doli who had glanced at the gem snorted scornfully its rubbish the dwarf said to taran no fair folk craftsman would waste his time on it we use better quality than that to mend a roadbed if your mushroomfaced friend wants to burden himself hes more than welcome without waiting to be told twice glew hastily thrust the gem into the leather pouch dangling at his side and his flabby features took on an expression taran had seen only when the former giant was in the midst of a meal from then on as the companions progressed steadily through the mine glews beady eyes darted everywhere and he strode forward with unwonted energy and interest the former giant was not disappointed for soon the torchlight glinted on other gems halfburied in the ground or protruding from walls glew fell upon them instantly scrabbling away with his pudgy fingers and popping the glittering crystals into his sack with each new find he grew more excited giggling and mumbling to himself the bard looked pityingly at him well he sighed the little weasel has at last sniffed out something to profit himself much good it may do him once were above ground again a handful of rocks the only use i can see is if he throws them at the cauldronborn but glew absorbed in gathering as many gems as quickly as he could paid no heed to fflewddurs remarks in little time the former giants pouch was crammed with jewels of bright red and brilliant green with gems clear as water or in their glittering depths flecked with gold and silver tarans thoughts were not on the abandoned riches of the mine although the jewels seemed to grow more plentiful as the long column of warriors made their way farther into the tunnel as far as taran could judge it was no later than midday and already the companions had journeyed a considerable distance and as the tunnel widened and the path straightened their pace gained even more speed easy as whistling declared doli another day and a half at most and well come above ground at the fallows its our only hope taran said and thanks to you the best hope weve had but the fallows trouble me if the land is barren well have little protection for ourselves and little means to hinder the cauldronborn humph cried doli as i told you youre dealing with fair folk now my lad when we set to a task theres nothing paltry or small about it youll see something will come to hand speaking of paltry and small interrupted fflewddur where is glew taran halted and quickly looked around at first he saw nothing of the former giant he lifted his torch and called glews name a moment later he caught sight of him and ran forward in alarm glew in his search for treasure had clambered up to one of the wooden platforms just above the arch leading to the next chamber a sparkling gem as big as his own head was embedded amid the rocks glew having swung precariously to a narrow ledge was trying with all his might to dislodge it taran cried out to him to come down but glew tugged and heaved all the harder dropping the reins of melynlas taran was about to swing up after him but doli seized his arm dont do it snapped the dwarf the beams wont hold you he whistled through his teeth and signaled two of the fair folk warriors to climb to the platform which under glews furious struggle with the gem had begun to sway dangerously hurry doli shouted bring that idiot down here just then glews pouch already filled to bursting tore apart the gems streamed down in a glittering shower and glew with a yell of dismay spun around to clutch at them his foothold slipped he clawed frantically at the platform and as he did so the arch gave way beneath him now shrieking not for his lost jewels but for his life glew flailed wildly and caught one of the swaying timbers with a crash he toppled to earth behind him the archway lurched the ceiling rumbled glew picked himself up and scuttled madly from the hail of falling stones back doli shouted back all of you the horses reared and whinnied as the warriors strove to turn them with an earsplitting crack the upper platforms collapsed an avalanche of boulders and broken beams thundered into the gallery blinding choking dust filled the tunnel the mine seemed to shudder all along its length then settle into deathly silence shouting for doli and fflewddur taran stumbled to the heap of wreckage none of the warriors or animals had been caught in it behind them the tunnel had held firm and kept them safe but the way forward was hopelessly blocked doli had scrambled onto the heap of stones and wood and was tugging at the end of a long beam but after a moment he stopped breathless and turned a despairing face to taran its no good he gasped if you want to keep on well have to dig our way through how long taran asked urgently how much time dare we lose doli shook his head hard to say even with fair folk it will be a long task days very likely who knows how far the damage has gone he snorted angrily you can thank that halfwitted undersized twolegged toadstool of a giant for it tarans heart sank what then he asked must we retrace our steps from the expression on dolis grimy face he feared what the dwarfs answer would be doli nodded curtly were badly delayed no matter what but if you want my advice i say turn around and go back make our way to the fallows above ground as best we can the whole mine is weakened now therell be more caveins or ill miss my guess next time we may not be so lucky lucky moaned the bard who had slumped down on a rock he put his head in his hands days wasted the cauldronborn will be in annuvin before we have another chance at them the only luck that would suit me now would be to see that greedy weasel under a pile of his own worthless gems glew meanwhile had ventured to crawl from under one of the remaining platforms his garments were torn his pudgy face smeared with dust days wasted he wailed cauldronborn blocked up tunnels but has any one of you stopped to consider ive just lost a fortune my gems are gone all of them and you dont give it a second thought i call that selfish selfish theres no other word for it chapter daylight the princess eilonwy was doubly angry first she was lost second she was a prisoner swept away from taran and fflewddur during the attack she would surely have fallen among the slain had not gurgi dragged her from the fray when the assault had shifted beyond them she had stumbled blindly with gurgi at her side over the darkening crags at nightfall when they could search no longer for taran gurgi had found a shallow cave where they crouched and shivered until first light during the next day as the two companions sought tarans trail the marauders had suddenly leaped upon them biting kicking and scratching eilonwy struggled vainly to free herself from the burly man who had seized her another had flung gurgi to the ground and with dagger drawn set his knee in the small of the hapless creatures back in a trice the two companions were bound hand and foot and hoisted like mealsacks on their assailants shoulders eilonwy had no idea of the direction in which she was being carried but in a little while she glimpsed a campfire flickering through the gathering dusk and hunched around it a ruffianly band of a dozen or more the man squatting nearest the fire looked up garbed in dirty sheepskins and a rough cloak he was heavyfaced and stubblebearded his long hair yellowish and tangled i sent you for game not prisoners he called out hoarsely what have you found lean pickings answered eilonwys captor dropping his furious burden to the turf beside gurgi a brace of churls for what they may be worth nothing very likely the heavyfaced man spat in the fire you should have slit their gullets and spared yourself the burden he climbed to his feet and strode to the companions with a grimy brokennailed hand he seized eilonwy by the throat as if he meant to throttle her who are you boy he demanded in a grating voice his cold blue eyes narrowed who do you serve what ransom will you bring answer quickly when dorath asks a question at the sound of the name eilonwy caught her breath taran had spoken of dorath from gurgis terrified whimpering she judged he too had recognized the outlaw answer dorath cried with a curse he struck eilonwy across the face the girl stumbled and fell her head singing from the blow the golden sphere dropped from her jacket eilonwy strained at her bonds and tried to fling herself on top of the bauble a booted foot kicked it from her dorath bent and snatched up the sphere turning it curiously in the firelight what is it questioned one of the ruffians pressing closer to gape at the bauble gold it is said another come dorath chop the thing apart and share it out hands off you swine dorath growled he thrust the bauble into his sheepskin mutters of protest rose from the band but dorath silenced them with a glance he bent down to eilonwy where did you steal such a trinket you young thief will you keep your head on your shoulders then tell me where we can find more treasure like this eilonwy though furious kept silent dorath grinned you will speak soon enough he said and only wish you had spoken earlier first let me see if your fellow has a tongue looser than yours gurgi teeth chattering violently had sunk his head deep into his sheepskin coat and tightly hunched his shoulders do you play turtle with me dorath cried with a harsh laugh he knotted his thick fingers in gurgis hair and jerked the creatures head upright small wonder you hide your face its ugly as ever ive seen dorath stopped suddenly and squinted closer ugly it is and not one easily forgotten so ho we are old friends you and i you share my hospitality once more when last we met you were comrade to a pigkeeper he turned his glance on eilonwy but this is not the swineherd dorath gripped eilonwys face and roughly turned it from side to side this beardless boy he grunted in surprise what then boy no boy at all a wench eilonwy could no longer contain herself wench indeed im eilonwy daughter of angharad daughter of regat princess of llyr i dont like being tied up i dont like being smacked i dont like being pawed and ill thank you to stop doing all of that immediately despite her bonds she kicked vigorously at the outlaw dorath laughed and drew back a pace my memory is that the lord swineherd spoke once of you he gave a mocking bow welcome princess vixen you are a choicer prize than any ransom a long score lies between dorath and your pigkeeper you give me and my company the pleasure of settling a little of it ill give you the pleasure of setting gurgi and me loose this very instant eilonwy flung at him and i shall have my bauble again doraths face had grown mottled you shall go free he said between his teeth after a time my pretty princess after a time when you shall be fitting company for pigkeepers perhaps you may join the swineherd again perhaps he will even recognize your charms whatever may be left of them have you considered what will be left of you when taran finds you eilonwy retorted until now the princess of llyr had kept her selfpossession but she could sense the outlaws thoughts behind his cold eyes and for the first time she was deeply afraid lord swineherd and i will finish our reckoning when the time comes dorath replied grinning he bent toward her but your time is now gurgi thrashed wildly in his bonds do not harm wise and kindly princess he shouted oh gurgi will make you pay for hurtful wickedness he flung himself against dorath and tried to sink his teeth into the outlaws leg cursing dorath turned on gurgi and snatched out his sword eilonwy cried aloud but before the outlaw could begin his downward stroke a long shape sprang suddenly from the overhanging rocks dorath give a stifled shout his weapon fell from his hand and he toppled backward the furry shadow snarling and tearing at his throat at the campfire the other outlaws leaped to their feet and screamed in terror gray shadows were all about closing swiftly on them vainly the marauders sought to flee but on all sides they were flung back borne to the ground by the force of lean bodies and slashing fangs gurgi began yelling fearfully help oh help oh evil spirits come to slay us all eilonwy forced herself upright behind her she could feel something sharp gnawing and worrying at her bonds in another moment her hands were free she stumbled forward while the gray shadow tore away the thongs holding her feet in front of her lay the motionless body of dorath quickly eilonwy knelt and drew the bauble from the outlaws sheepskin jacket from her cupped hand the sphere shed golden rays on a huge wolf crouching before her by the campfire she glimpsed other wolves withdrawing as swiftly as they had come behind them all was silent eilonwy shuddered and looked away the wolves had done their work well gurgi had been freed by a gray shewolf with a white blaze on her breast and pleased though he was to be out of the warriors clutches he wrinkled his forehead and cast a distrustful glance at his rescuer the wolf briavael blinked her yellow eyes and grinned at him gurgi nevertheless chose to keep his distance for her own part eilonwy surprisingly felt no fear or uneasiness the wolf brynach sat on his haunches watching her closely eilonwy put her hand on the animals shaggy muscular neck i hope you know were trying to thank you she said though im not sure whether you understand or not the only wolves i ever met personally lived far from here in medwyns valley at this brynach whined and wagged his tail well you do understand that said eilonwy medwyn she hesitated there were two wolves she clapped her hands it must be i dont mean to say i can tell one wolf from another at least not at first glance but theres something about you that reminds me in any case if thats who you are were very glad to see you again were obliged to you and now well be on our way though im not exactly sure which way our way is if you see what i mean brynach grinned and showed no sign of leaving instead he remained on his haunches opened his jaws and gave a high pitched bark eilonwy sighed and shook her head were lost and trying to find our companions but i havent any idea how to say assistant pigkeeper in wolf speech gurgi meantime had picked up his wallet of food and slung it over his shoulder at last seeing the wolves meant him no harm he drew a little closer to brynach and briavael and looked at them with great interest while they studied him no less curiously eilonwy turned to gurgi im sure theyre willing to help us oh if i could only understand them what good is it being half an enchantress if you cant even tell what a wolf is trying to say to you eilonwy stopped short but but i think i did understand i must have there one of them just said tell us i could hear no not hear i could feel it she looked at gurgi in amazement its not words at all its like listening without your ears or hearing with your heart i know it but i cant imagine how i do and yet she added wonderingly thats what taliesin told me oh great wisdoml gurgi cried oh clever listenings gurgi listens too but inside hears only rumblings and grumblings when his poor belly is empty oh sorrow gurgi will never hear deep secret things like princess eilonwy had dropped to her knees beside brynach hurriedly she spoke of taran of all the companions and what had befallen them brynach pricked up his ears and barked sharply the huge wolf rose from his haunches shook the snow from his shaggy coat and with his teeth gently plucked at eilonwys sleeve he says were to follow them eilonwy told gurgi come were in safe hands now or should i say paws the wolves padded silently and swiftly following hidden trails and passages whose existence the girl would have never guessed the two companions strove to keep up with brynachs rapid pace yet often despite themselves they were forced to halt and rest at those times the wolves seemed satisfied to wait patiently until the companions were ready to journey once again brynach crouched at eilonwys side his gray head between his paws seldom drowsing his ears alert and moving at every faint sound briavael too served as sentinel and guide springing lightly to the rocky peaks sniffing the air then with a gesture of her head beckoning the companions to follow of the rest of the pack eilonwy saw little now and then however she would awaken from a brief slumber to find the wolves sitting in a protective circle about her soon the lean gray animals would vanish into the shadows while brynach and briavael alone remained the girl shortly became aware the wolves were not the only creatures in the hills of brangaledd once she glimpsed a large company of bears lumbering in single file along a ridge they halted a moment peered curiously then resumed their march in the cold clear air she heard the barking of foxes in the distance and other sounds which might have been echoes or answers to some unknown signal theyre scouting all through the hills eilonwy whispered to gurgi pointing to a bare summit where a tall stag had suddenly appeared i wonder how many other bands of outlaws are roaming around if the bears and wolves have anything to say about it i somehow dont think theres very many the wolf brynach glanced at her as though he had overhead eilonwys words he lolled out his tongue and blinked his yellow eyes around the sharp rows of gleaming teeth his lips turned slightly in an unmistakable smile they continued on their path at nightfall eilonwy lit her bauble and held it aloft the full wolf pack she saw had joined them once again moving in long files on either side of her just beyond the circle of golden light the bears too were following and other forest creatures whose presence she sensed rather than saw there were in the hills of brangaledd many places of danger and death of these the princess of llyr was unaware for she and gurgi passed them by unharmed safe amid the watchful band of silent guardians late in the morning of the next day briavael who had spent most of her time scouting the passages ahead grew excited and eager the shewolf barked and leaped atop high standing rocks where she faced westward wagging her tail briskly and urging the companions to greater speed i think theyve found taran eilonwy cried i cant quite make out what theyre saying but it sounds very much as if they have men and horses a mountain cat that must be llyan but what are they all doing in this direction are they going to the red fallows again neither eilonwy nor gurgi could check their impatience to join the companions once more they refused to halt for food or rest and brynach frequently had to fasten his teeth in eilonwys cloak to keep the girl from taking needless risks among the eversteepening hills soon the travelers reached the rim of a deep mountain cup and a cry of joy burst from eilonwys lips i see them i see them she hastily pointed downward into the wide valley gurgi had run up beside her and began to leap with excitement oh it is kindly master he shouted oh yes and brave bard no bigger than ants but sharpeyed gurgi sees them only by straining her eyes could eilonwy distinguish the tiny figures so distant were they the long descent into the valley she knew would take the rest of the day and she was anxious to reach the companions before nightfall she was about to scramble down the cliff when she stopped suddenly what can they be doing she cried theyre going straight into that wall of rock is it a cave look theres the last horseman now i cant see any of them if its a cave it must be the biggest one in prydain i dont understand a bit of it is there a passage of some kind or a tunnel oh thats vexing you might know an assistant pigkeeper would take it into his head to vanish the moment hes been found hurriedly eilonwy began picking her way down the steep slope for all her haste the descent seemed endless even with the help of brynach and briavael the two had gone little more than half the distance by the time the sun had dropped westward and the shadows had begun to lengthen brynach suddenly halted and growled deeply in his throat his hackles rose and he bared his teeth the eyes of the wolf were fixed on the valley and his muzzle twitched uneasily in another moment eilonwy saw what had made brynach stop a long column of warriors had appeared and was moving rapidly westward briavael whined shrilly from the voice of the shewolf eilonwy sensed fear and hatred she understood the reason huntsmen the girl cried it looks like hundreds of them on the way back to annuvin oh i hope they dont see tarans tracks though hes very likely safe enough where he is no sooner had she said this than a movement at the distant wall of rock made her clap a hand to her mouth from the deepening shadows she saw one by one the tiny figures of taran and his band reappear no eilonwy gasped theyre coming out again from her vantage point the girl could scan the valley and it was suddenly coldly clear to her that the commot warriors and the huntsmen as yet unseen by one another were moving closer together theyll be trapped eilonwy cried taran taran the echoes died in the vast snowy expanse taran could neither see nor hear her darkness had now fallen over the valley blinding the girl to the inevitable clash of the warrior bands it was a nightmare in which all action was useless in which she could only wait for the slaughter bound to come she felt as though her hands were tied and her voice stifled still calling tarans name eilonwy snatched the bauble from her cloak she lifted the sphere high brighter and brighter it glowed the wolves turned away fearfully and gurgi threw his arms over his face the beams spread and rose toward the clouds as though the sun itself were bursting from the mountainside the dark cliffs and black branches of the trees were drenched in light brilliant and clear the whole valley had turned bright as noon chapter the river of ice under the sudden outpouring of golden light the huntsmen shouted in alarm and a wave of fear rippled along the marching column as they faltered and fell back into the protection of a deep gorge instantly taran realized how closely he had come to leading the commot horsemen into a fatal trap but a cry of joy sprang from his lips eilonwy he would have urged melynlas across the valley to the mountainside had not fflewddur put out a restraining hand hold hold cried the bard shes found us right enough great belin theres no mistaking the light from that girls bauble shes saved out lives with it gurgis sure to be with her too but if you go galloping after them none of you will get back weve seen the huntsmen and they could hardly help seeing us doli had clambered atop a boulder and stood peering after the retreating huntsmen eilonwys signal winked out as quickly as it had appeared and in another moment the winter darkness fell once more over the valley a fine plight growled the dwarf of all times to be caught above ground the mine is useless to us and theres no other passage within a weeks march even if there were we couldnt reach it with an army of huntsmen blocking the way fflewddur had drawn his sword i say attack those foul villains had a good scare theyll have no stomach for a fight now well set upon them without warning great belin thats something they wont expect doli snorted at him youve left your wits in the mineshaft set upon the huntsmen slay one and make the others that much stronger even fair folk would think twice about attacking those ruffians no my friend it wont answer when i was a giant put in glew it would have been a simple matter for me to put them all to flight however through no fault of my own times have changed and i can hardly say theyve changed for the better on mona for example one day i had decided something really had to be done about those impudent bats its an interesting tale silence you puny thing commanded the bard youve said enough and done enough thats right lay all the blame on me sniffed glew its my fault gwydions sword was stolen my fault the cauldronborn escaped my fault every other disagreeable thing has happened the bard did not deign to answer the former giants whining outburst taran having ordered the commot warriors into the relative safety of the tunnel mouth returned and stood beside the companions i fear doli is right taran said by attacking the huntsmen we can only destroy ourselves our strength is slight enough as it is and we dare not waste it we have been long delayed and already may be too late to aid gwydion no we must find some means to make our way despite the huntsmen doli shook his head still wont answer they know were here theyll know if we try to move all they need to do is track us for the matter of that ill be surprised if were not attacked before dawn look to your skins my friends it may be the last time youll see them whole doli taran said urgently youre the only one who can help us now will you spy out the huntsmens camp learn all you can of their plans i know how you feel about turning yourself invisible but invisible shouted the dwarf clapping a hand to his head i knew it would come to that sooner or later it always does good old doli turn invisible im not sure i can do it any more ive tried to forget how it hurts my ears id sooner have my head stuffed with hornets and wasps no no out of the question ask anything else you like but not that good old doli taran said i was sure youd do it after a further show of reluctance which deceived no one except perhaps doli himself the crimsonhaired dwarf consented to do as taran had asked doli wrinkled his eyes shut took a deep breath as though making ready to plunge into icy water and flickered out of sight had it not been for a stifled sound of irritable grumbling taran would not have believed doli to be there at all only the faint click of pebbles stirred by unseen feet told taran that the dwarf had moved from the tunnel toward the enemy lines at dolis orders the fair folk troop took guard posts in a wide halfcircle beyond the tunnels mouth where their sharp eyes and ears could catch any threatening movement or sound taran was amazed at how still these warriors remained silent and nearly as invisible as doli their white garb made them seem no more than icecovered stones or frosted hummocks under the moon which had now begun to drift from behind the clouds the horsemen drowsed among their steeds for warmth glew curled up nearby just within the tunnel fflewddur sat with his back against the wall of rock one hand on his harp the other resting on the huge head of llyan who had stretched out beside him and was gently purring mufed in his cloak taran gazed once more in wonder at the mountainside where first had appeared eilonwys signal light she is alive he murmured to himself alive he whispered again and again and his heart leaped each time he spoke the words gurgi would be with her of this he was somehow sure all his senses told him both companions had survived over the chill air came the baying of a wolf there were other sounds as of distant shouting but they soon faded and he gave them no thought filled as he was with his newfound hope half the night had worn away when doli flickered back into sight the dwarf too excited to complain of his buzzing ears hurriedly beckoned taran and fflewddur to follow him ordering the horsemen to stand alert taran hastened after the companions the fair folk warriors were already jogtrotting behind doli silent as white shadows taran at first thought the dwarf meant to lead them directly to the huntsmens camp instead doli turned off a little distance before it and began scrambling up a slope rising high above the gorge the huntsmen are still there doli muttered under his breath as they climbed no wish of their own we have some friends we didnt know about bears and wolves dozens of them all along the rim of the gorge a band of huntsmen tried to climb out good thing they couldnt see me or i wouldnt be here but they were seen the bears got to them first quick work they made of those villains bloody work but quick they slew a party of huntsmen taran frowned now the others are even stronger be that as it may replied doli the bears and wolves can attend to them better than we can i doubt the huntsmen will attack tonight they fear the animals theyll stay in the gorge until morning and thats where i want them i think ive struck on something by this time they had reached the summit and had come to the rim of an icebound lake at the sheer drop over the edge of the bluff a frozen waterfall glittered under the moon like fingers on a huge fist vast icicles clawed at the steep slope as though holding the lake in its frigid grip a river of hard silver twisted downward toward the gorge where the huntsmen were sheltering taran glimpsed their campfires glowing like baleful eyes in the darkness though he could not be sure it seemed to him that shadowy shapes stirred among the rocks and stunted brush of the higher ground perhaps the bears and wolves of which the dwarf had spoken there doli said what do you think of that what do i think cried the bard my old friend i think youre the one who left your wits in the mine youve led us on a good climb but i should hardly call this a moment to admire the beauties of nature the dwarf put his hands on his hips and looked at fflewddur with exasperation sometimes i think eiddilegs right about you humans cant you see past your nose cant you see at all were nearly atop those ruffians free the lake free the waterfall let it go pouring down straight into the camp taran caught his breath for a moment his heart leaped hopefully then he shook his head the task is too great doli the ice will defeat us then melt it shouted the dwarf cut branches bushes all that will burn where the ice is too thick chop it away how many times must i tell you youre dealing with fair folk can it indeed be done taran whispered would i have said it if i didnt think so the dwarf snapped fflewddur gave a low whistle of admiration you think in large terms old fellow but it appeals to me great belin if we could pull it off wed strike them all down at one blow and rid ourselves of them once and for all doli was no longer listening to the bard but was passing hasty orders to the fair folk warriors who unslung their axes and with all speed began chopping and hacking at the trees uprooting underbrush and racing with their burdens to the lake casting his doubts aside taran drew his sword and hewed at the branches fflewddur toiled beside him despite the bitter cold air their brows streamed their panting breath hung in a white haze before their faces at the frozen waterfall the axes of the fair folk rang upon the ice doli dashed among the warriors adding to the pile of bushes and branches dislodging rocks and boulders to form a straighter swifter channel the night was waning quickly taran stumbled in exhaustion his coldnumbed hands torn and bleeding fflewddur was barely able to keep his feet but the efforts of the fair folk never slackened before dawn the lake and the watercourse were piled high as though a forest had overgrown them only then was doli satisfied now well set it alight he cried to taran fair folk tinder burns hotter than anything you humans know it will blaze in no time he whistled shrilly through his teeth all along the lake the torches of the fair folk flamed then arched like shooting stars as the warriors flung them into the pyre taran saw the first branches catch fire then the rest a fierce crackling filled his ears and over it he heard doli shouting for the companions to race clear of the blaze a wave of heat like the breath of a furnace caught at taran as he struggled for a foothold among the stones the ice was melting he heard the hiss of quenched flames but the fire too high to be altogether extinguished raged even more hotly from the watercourse came the crack and groan of boulders shifting under the growing pressure of the rising flood in a moment like a gate ripped from its hinges like a wall collapsing the side of the bluff gave way and through the channel burst a sheet of water carrying all before it huge blocks of ice thundered down the slope bounding and rolling as if they had been no more than pebbles the swift outpouring bore with it the flaming branches above the streaming mass clouds of sparks billowed and swirled and the watercourse blazed all along its length in the gorge below the huntsmen shouted and strove to flee it was too late the rushing waters and careening boulders flung back the warriors as they sought to scramble up the ravine screaming and cursing they fell beneath the cascade or were tossed in the air like chips to be dashed against the sharp rocks a few gained higher ground but as they did taran saw dark shapes spring to grapple with them and now it was the turn of the waiting animals to take vengeance on those who had ever mercilessly hunted and slaughtered them silence fell over the gorge in the dawn light taran saw the glint of the dark water that had flooded the ravine some of the branches still burned others smouldered and a gray mist of smoke hung in the air a rattle of stones behind him made taran spin about and snatch his blade from the scabbard hullo said eilonwy were back again you have an odd way of welcoming people eilonwy went on as taran his heart too full to speak stared speechless at her you might at least say something while gurgi yelping joyfully tried to greet everyone at once taran stepped quickly to eilonwys side put his arms about her and drew the princess close to him i had given up hope a silly thing to do eilonwy answered i never did though i admit having a few uneasy moments with that ruffian dorath and i could tell you tales you wouldnt believe about wolves and bears ill save them for later when you can tell me all thats been happening to you as for the huntsmen she continued as the reunited companions made their way to the tunnel i saw the whole thing at first i hadnt any idea what you were up to then i understood it was wonderful i should have known doli had a hand in it good old doli it looked like a river of burning ice the princess stopped suddenly and her eyes widened do you realize what youve done she whispered dont you see know what weve done laughed fflewddur indeed we do weve rid ourselves of the huntsmen and a good job it was a fflam couldnt have done better as for what i see im more pleased with what i cant see if you take my meaning namely not a sign of those villains hen wens prophery eilonwy cried part of its come true have all of you forgotten night turn to noon and rivers burn with frozen fire ere dyrnwyn be regained well youve burned a river or so it seems to me frozen fire could just as well mean all that ice and flaming branches couldnt it taran looked closely at the princess his hands trembled as the words of the prophecy echoed in his memory have you seen what we ourselves did not see but have you not done as much as we did without realizing it yourself think night turn to noon your bauble made daylight of darkness it was eilonwys turn to be surprised so it did she exclaimed yes yes shouted gurgi wise piggy told the truth mighty blade will be found again fflewddur cleared his throat a fflam is always encouraging he said but in this case i should remind you the prophecy also said dyrnwyns flame would be quenched and its power would vanish which leaves us no better off than we were even if we did manage to find it and i also recall something about asking mute stones to speak so far ive heard not a word from any of the stones here though in the matter of boulders and rocks theres hardly a short supply the only message theyve given me is that theyre hard to sleep on moreover if you want my opinion id say dont trust prophecies in the first place its been my experience theyre as bad as enchantments and lead only to one thing trouble i do not understand the meaning of the prophecy myself taran said are these signs of hope or do we deceive ourselves by wishing them to be only dallben or gwydion has wisdom to interpret them and yet i cant help feeling there is some hope at last but it is true our task is no easier than it was doli grimaced no easier its impossible now do you still mean to gain the red fallows i warn you the cauldronborn are far out of reach he snorted dont talk to me about prophecies talk about time weve lost too much of it i have thought long about this too taran answered it has been in my mind ever since the tunnel fell i believe our only chance is to go straight across the mountains and try to hold back the cauldronborn as they turn northwest to annuvin slim hope doli replied the fair folk cant venture that far its forbidden land that close to arawns realm fair folk would die gwystyls waypost was nearest to the land of death and youve seen what it did to his digestion and disposition the best we could do is to put you well on your way one of us might go with you he added you can imagine who that is good old doli ive spent so much time above ground with you humans that being in annuvin cant harm me yes ill go with you doli went on scowling furiously i see nothing else for it good old doli sometimes i wish i didnt have such an agreeable temper humph chapter the enchanter like a weary child the old man hunched over the bookstrewn table his head upon his arm across his bony shoulders he had flung a cloak the fire still flickered in the hearth but the chill of this winter sank into him more deeply than any other he could remember at his feet hen wen stirred restlessly and whimpered in a high plaintive voice dallben who was neither altogether asleep nor awake reached down a frail hand and gently scratched her ear the pig would not be calmed her pink snout twitched she snorted and muttered unhappily and tried to hide her head in the folds of his robe the enchanter at last roused himself what is it hen is our time upon us he gave the pig a reassuring pat and rose stiffly from the wooden stool tut it is a moment to pass no more than that whatever the outcome without haste he took up a long ashwood staff and leaning on it hobbled from the chamber hen wen trotted at his heels at the cottage door he pulled the cloak tighter about him and stepped into the night the moon was at its full riding distant in a deep sky dallben stood listening carefully to anothers ears the little farm would have seemed silent as the moon itself but the old enchanter his brow furrowed his eyes half closed nodded his head you are right hen he murmured i hear them now but they are still far what then he added with a wrinkled smile must i wait long for them and freeze the little marrow left in my bones nevertheless he did not return within the cottage but moved a few paces across the dooryard his eyes which had been heavy with drowsiness grew bright as ice crystals he peered sharply past the leafless trees of the orchard as though to see into the shadows entwining the circling forest like black ivy tendrils hen wen stayed behind sitting uneasily on her haunches and watching the enchanter with much concern on her broad bristly face i should say there are twenty of them dallben remarked then added wryly i do not know whether to be insulted or relieved only twenty it is a paltry number yet more than that would be too cumbersome for the long journey especially through the fighting in the valley of ystrad no twenty would be deemed ample and well chosen for some time the old man stood quietly and patiently at last through the clear air a faint sound of hoofbeats grew more insistent then stopped as if the riders had dismounted and were walking their steeds against the dark tangle of trees where the forest rose at the edge of the stubble field the darting shapes could have been no more than shadows cast by the bushes dallben straightened raised his head and blew out his breath as gently as if he were puffing at thistledown in an instant a biting gale shrieked across the field the farm was calm but the wind ripped with the force of a thousand swords into the forest where the trees clashed and rattled horses whinnied men shouted as branches suddenly lashed against them the gale beat against the warriors who flung up their arms to shield themselves from it still the war band pressed on struggling through the wind whipped forest and at last gaining the stubble field at the onset of the gale hen wen squealing fearfully had turned tail and dashed into the cottage dallben raised a hand and the wind died as quickly as it had risen frowning the old man smote his staff on the frozen turf deep thunder muttered the ground shuddered and the field heaved like a restless sea the warriors staggered and lost their footing and among the attackers many fled to the safety of the forest hastening to escape fearful the earth itself might open and swallow them the rest urging each other on drew their swords and stumbled across the field racing toward the cottage with some vexation dallben thrust out his arm with fingers spread as though he were casting pebbles into a pond from his hand a crimson flame spurted and stretched like a fiery lash in blinding streaks against the black sky the warriors cried out as ropes of crackling flame caught at them and twined about their arms and legs the horses broke loose and galloped madly into the woods the attackers threw down their weapons and tore frantically at their cloaks and jackets howling in pain and terror the men reeled and plunged in full flight back to the forest the flames vanished dallben about to turn away glimpsed one figure which still pressed across the empty field alarmed the old man gripped his staff and hobbled as quickly as he could into the cottage the warrior was striding past the stables and into the dooryard with footfalls pounding behind him dallben hurried across the threshold but the old man had no sooner gained the refuge of his chamber than the warrior burst through the doorway dallben spun about to face his assailant beware cried the enchanter beware take no step closer dallben had drawn himself up to his full height his eyes flashed and his voice rang with such a commanding tone that the warrior hesitated the mans hood had fallen back and the firelight played over the golden hair and proud features of pryderi son of pwyll dallbens eyes never faltered i have long awaited you king of the west domains pryderi made as if to take a step forward his hand dropped to the pommel of the naked sword at his belt yet the old mans glance held him you mistake my rank pryderi said mockingly now i rule a larger realm prydain itself what then replied dallben feigning surprise is gwydion of the house of don no longer high king of prydain pryderi laughed harshly a king without a kingdom a king in rags hunted like a fox caer dathyl has fallen the sons of don are scattered to the wind this you already know though it seems the tidings have reached you swiftly all tidings reach me swiftly dallben said swifter perhaps than they reach you do you boast of your powers pryderi answered scornfully at the last when you most needed them they failed your spells did no more than frighten a handful of warriors does the crafty dallben take pride in putting churls to flight my spells were not meant to destroy only to warn dallben replied this is a place of danger to all who enter against my will your followers heeded my warning alas lord pryderi that you did not these churls are wiser than their king for it is not wisdom that a man should seek his own death again you are mistaken wizard pryderi said it is your death i seek dallben tugged at the wisps of his beard what you may seek and what you may find are not always one son of pwyll he said quietly yes you would take my life that is no secret to me has caer dathyl fallen that victory is hollow so long as caer dallben stands and so long as i live two strongholds have long stood against the lord of annuvin a golden castle and a farmers cottage one lies in ruins but the other is still a shield against evil and a sword ever pointed at arawns heart the deathlord knows this and knows as well that he can not enter here nor can his huntsmen and cauldronborn thus have you come dallben added to do your masters bidding a flush of anger spread over pryderis face i am my own master he cried if power is given me to serve prydain shall i fear to use it i am no huntsman who kills for the joy of killing i do what must be done and shrink not from it my purpose is greater than the life of a man or a thousand men and if you must die dallben then so be it pryderi ripped the sword from his belt and in a sudden movement struck at the enchanter but dallben had taken a firmer grip on his staff and raised it against the blow pryderis blade shattered upon the slender wood and the shards fell ringing to the ground pryderi cast the broken hilt from him yet it was not fear that filled his eyes but scorn i have been warned of your powers wizard i chose to prove them for myself dallben had not moved have you been truly warned i think not had you been you would not have dared to face me your strength is great wizard pryderi said but not so great as your weakness your secret is known to me strive against me as you will at the end it is i who must conquer of all powers one is forbidden you on pain of your own death are you master of winds can you make the earth tremble this is useless toying you can not do what the lowest warrior can do you can not kill from his cloak pryderi had drawn a short black dagger whose pommel bore the seal of annuvin no such ban is laid upon me he said as i have been warned so have i been armed this blade comes from the hand of arawn himself it can be wielded despite all your spells a look of pity and deep sorrow had come over dallbens wrinkled face poor foolish man he murmured it is true this weapon of annuvin can take my life and i can not stay your hand but you are blind as the mole that toils in the earth ask now lord pryderi which the master and which the slave arawn has betrayed you yes betrayed you dallben said his voice sharp and cold you thought to make him serve you yet all unwitting you have served him better than any of his hirelings he sent you to slay me and gave you the means to do it indeed perhaps you shall slay me but it will be arawns triumph not yours once you have done his bidding you are a useless husk to the lord of annuvin he knows full well that never will i let you depart alive from caer dallben you are a dead man lord pryderi even as you stand here pryderi raised the black dagger with words you seek to ward off your death see from the window dallben answered as he spoke a crimson glow poured through the casement a broad belt of flames had sprung up to circle caer dallben pryderi faltered and stepped back you have believed halftruths dallben said no man has ever suffered death at my hands but those who scorn my spells do so at their own peril slay me lord pryderi and the flames you see will sweep over caer dallben in an instant there is no escape for you pryderis golden features were drawn in a look of disbelief mingled with growing fear at the enchanters words you lie he whispered hoarsely the flames will die even as you will die that lord you must prove for yourself dallben said i have my proof pryderi cried arawn would not destroy what he seeks most there were two tasks in all your wisdom you did not guess them your death was only one the other to gain the book of three dallben shook his head sadly and glanced at the heavy leatherbound tome you have been doubly betrayed then this book will no more serve arawn than it will serve any evil end nor will it serve you lord pryderi the force of the old mans voice was like a cold wind you have steeped your hands in blood and in your pride sought to pass judgment on your fellow men was it your concern to serve prydain you chose an evil means to do it good can not come from evil you leagued yourself with arawn for what you deemed a noble cause now you are a prisoner of the very evil you hoped to overcome prisoner and victim for in the book of three you are already marked for death dallbens eyes blazed and the truth of his words seemed to grip pryderis throat the kings face had turned ashen with a cry he flung away the dagger and clutched at the huge book desperately his hands reached out as if they would rip it asunder touch it not dallben commanded but pryderi had already seized it as he did so a blinding bolt of lightning sprang like a blazing tree from the ancient tome pryderis death shriek rang through the chamber dallben turned away and bowed his head as though some heavy grief had come upon him beyond the little farm the circle of fire dwindled and faded in the quiet dawn chapter the snowstorm the fair folk warriors all save doli had turned back at the line of treeless crags marking the westernmost edge of the hills of brangaledd for beyond that point the land lay under the sway of arawn deathlord for some days now the companions had toiled painfully through a wilderness of stone where not even moss or lichen flourished the sky was gray and the few thin clouds no more than shreds of darker gray it was as though an evil mist had seeped from the stronghold of annuvin stifling all living things and leaving only this rocky waste the companions spoke little husbanding their strength from the first day within the borders of the land of death they had been obliged to dismount and go on foot leading the weary horses through the treacherous passes even the stallion melynlas showed signs of fatigue the steeds powerful neck drooped and his gait sometimes faltered llyan however padded skillfully along the narrowest and most dangerous of ledges often while the companions labored down one sharp descent to clamber up an even sharper slope the enormous cat leaped from one crag to the next and they would come upon her sitting with her tail coiled about her haunches waiting for fflewddur to scratch her ears after which she would bound off once more doli firmly gripping his staff his white hood pulled well down over his face trudged at the head of the little band taran had never ceased to wonder at the tireless dwarf who found as though by secret sense hidden footpaths and narrow ways that helped speed the harsh journey yet after a time dolis pace seemed to flag taran saw with growing concern and uneasiness that from time to time the dwarf would lose his footing and his step turn suddenly unsure when doli staggered and dropped to one knee taran ran to his side alarmed and tried to lift up the dwarf the companions hurried to join him dolis usually ruddy face had grown mottled and he breathed only in painful gasps he struggled to regain his feet curse this evil realm he muttered cant stand it as well as i thought dont gawk give me a hand up stubbornly the dwarf refused to mount one of the horses insisting he felt better when his feet were on the ground when taran urged him to rest doli angrily shook his head i said id find a passage for you he snapped and i mean to cant stand a botched job when the fair folk set about a task they do it right and dont dawdle over it nevertheless after a short while doli reluctantly consented to climb astride melynlas he fumbled with the stirrups but grumbled irritably when fflewddur helped him into the saddle even this relief was not long lasting the dwarfs head soon dropped weakly forward he swayed unsteadily and before taran could reach him lurched from the stallions back and pitched to the ground taran quickly signaled a halt well go no further today he told the dwarf by morning youll have your strength again doli shook his head his face was white his crimson eyes had turned dull no use waiting he gasped ive been too long here it will grow worse must keep on while i can still guide you not at the cost of your life taran said hevydd the smith will ride with you to the border llassar son of drudwas will help the rest of us find our way wont do muttered the dwarf take too long without fair folk skill tie me to the saddle he commanded he strove to raise himself from the ground but fell back and lay motionless his breathing grew rasping and violent taran cried out in alarm hes dying hurry fflewddur help me put him on llyan she is the swiftest mount ride back with him there may still be time leave me here doli gasped you cant spare fflewddur his sword is worth ten or six at least go quickly that i will not do replied taran fool choked the dwarf heed me he commanded it must be done are you a war leader or an assistant pigkeeper taran knelt by the dwarf whose eyes were halfclosed and gently put a hand on dolis shoulder need you ask old friend im an assistant pigkeeper taran rose to meet the bard who had hastened up with llyan but when he turned back to the dwarf the ground was empty doli had vanished where has he gone shouted fflewddur an irritable voice came from somewhere near a boulder here where else do you think doli cried taran you were close to your death and now ive turned invisible as any clodpole with half an ounce of sense can plainly see snorted doli should have thought of it before last time in annuvin i was invisible most of the way never realized how it protected me can it serve you now asked taran still a little bewildered dare you keep on of course the dwarf retorted im better already but ill have to stay invisible as long as i can stand it that is invisible hornets and wasps in my ears good old doli taran cried seeking vainly to pump the dwarfs unseen hand not that again snapped the dwarf id not do this willingly oh my ears for any mortal in prydain oh my head but you and dont shout my ears wont stand it dolis staff which had dropped to the ground seemed to rise of itself as the invisible dwarf picked it up from the motion of the staff taran could see that doli had once more begun trudging ahead guiding themselves by the length of wood the companions followed yet even without sight of the staff they could have found their way led by the sound of loud and furious grumbling fflewddur was first to sight the gwythaints in the distance above a shallow ravine three blackwinged shapes soared and circled what have they found the bard cried whatever it is i hope were not the ones to be found next taran sounded his horn and signaled the war band to find whatever protection they could among the huge boulders eilonwy disregarding tarans orders scrambled to the top of a high jutting stone and shaded her eyes i cant tell for sure eilonwy said but it looks to me as though theyve cornered something poor creature it will not last long against them gurgi crouched fearfully against a rock and tried to make himself as flat as a fish nor will gurgi if they see him he wailed they will seize his poor tender head with gashings and slashings pass on pass on glew shouted his little face puckered in fright theyre busy with their prey dont stop here like fools get as far away as we can oh if i were a giant again youd not find me lingering the gwythaints narrowed their circle and had begun to swoop downward seeking their kill but suddenly what appeared to be a black cloud with a dark shape leading it streaked down from the eastern quarter of the sky before the surprised companions could follow its swift movement overhead the cloud shattered as if at its leaders command into winged fragments that drove straight upon the huge birds even at this distance taran could hear the furious screams of the gwythaints as they veered aloft to face these strange assailants fflewddur had leaped up beside eilonwy and as taran and doli clambered to a vantage point the bard shouted excitedly crows great belin ive never seen so many like great black hornets the crows swarmed over their enemy it was not a single combat of bird against bird but a battle in which whole troops of crows grappled and clung to the gwythaints lashing wings heedless of sharp beaks and talons forcing the creatures earthward when by sheer strength the gwythaints shook off their attackers a new troop would form and renew the charge the gwythaints sought to break free of their burden by plunging downward scraping as closely as they dared against the sharp stones but as they did the crows pecked furiously at them and the gwythaints spun and fluttered dizzily losing their course and falling once again victim to the relentless onslaught in a last burst of power the gwythaints beat their way aloft they turned and sped desperately northward with the crows in hot pursuit they vanished over the horizon all save a solitary crow that flew swiftly toward the companions kaw taran shouted and held out his arms jabbering at the top of his voice the crow swooped down his eyes glittered in triumph and he flapped his shiny wings more proudly than a rooster he gabbled croaked squawked and poured forth such a torrent of yammering that gurgi clapped his hands over his ears from his perch on tarans wrist kaw bobbed his head and clacked his beak thoroughly delighted with himself and never for a moment ceasing his chatter taran trying vainly to interrupt the crows raucous and boastful clamor had despaired of learning any tidings from the roguish bird when kaw flapped his wings and sought to fly off again achren kaw croaked achren queen youve seen her taran caught his breath he had given little thought to the oncepowerful queen since her flight from caer dallben where is she the crow fluttered a little distance away then returned his beating wings urging taran to follow him close close gwythaints eilonwy gasped thats what we saw the gwythaints have slain her alive kaw answered hurt taran ordered the commot horsemen to await him then leaped to the ground to follow after kaw eilonwy doli and gurgi hastened to join him glew refused to budge remarking that he had already skinned himself on enough rocks and had no intention of going out of his way for anyone fflewddur hesitated a moment yes well i suppose i shall go along too should you need help in carrying her but it doesnt sit well with me achren was eager enough to go her own way and i rather think we shouldnt meddle not that i fear her not for a moment ah the truth of it is he hurriedly added as the harp strings tensed the woman makes me shudder since the day she threw me into her dungeon ive noticed something unfriendly about her she has no fondness for music i can tell you nevertheless he cried a fflam to the rescue like a tattered bundle of black rags the still form of queen achren lay in the fissure of a massive rock where she had in her last hope pressed to escape the gwythaints vicious beaks and talons yet her refuge taran saw pityingly had offered the queen scant protection achren moaned faintly as the companions carefully lifted her from the crevice llyan who had followed along with the bard crouched silently nearby and lashed her tail uneasily achrens face drawn and deathly pale had been badly slashed and her arms bore many deep and bleeding wounds eilonwy held the woman and tried to revive her llyan shall carry her back with us taran said she will need more healing herbs than i have brought more than her wounds a fever has weakened her she has gone long without food or drink her shoes are in ribbons eilonwy said how far must she have wandered in this awful place poor achren i cant say im fond of her but it makes my toes curl up just imagining what could have happened fflewddur after helping move the unconscious queen to more level ground had stayed a few paces away gurgi too chose to keep some distance between achren and himself nevertheless at tarans bidding they drew closer and the bard with many soothing words held llyan steady while the other companions lifted achren to the great cats back hurry along called the voice of doli its starting to snow white flakes had begun drifting from the heavy sky within little time a biting wind swirled around the companions and snow drove against them in an everthickening cloud needles of ice stung their faces it grew more and more difficult to see and as the storm gained in fury even doli could no longer be sure of the path the companions staggered blindly in a file each clutching the other with taran gripping an end of dolis staff kaw almost entirely covered with snow hunched up his wings and tried desperately to keep his perch on tarans shoulder llyan burdened with the motionless queen bent her great head against the gale and plodded onward but the surefooted cat often stumbled over hidden boulders and snowfilled pits once gurgi yelled in terror and vanished as suddenly as if the earth had swallowed him he had tumbled into a deep crevice and by the time the companions were able to haul him out the hapless creature had nearly turned into a shaggy icicle he trembled so violently he could scarcely walk and between them taran and fflewddur bore him along the wind did not slacken the snow fell in an impenetrable curtain and the cold already bitter grew even more intense breathing was painful and with each labored gasp taran felt the frigid draft like daggers in his lungs eilonwy halfsobbed with cold and exhaustion and she clung to taran striving to keep her footing as doli led them through drifts that now had risen more than kneehigh we cant go on the dwarf shouted above the wind find shelter make our way to the horsemen when the snow lets up but the warriors how shall they fare taran replied anxiously better than we the dwarf cried where they are theres a goodsized cave i noticed along the cliff wall your young shepherd is bound to find it never fear our trouble is finding something for ourselves however even after long and painful searching the dwarf discovered nothing more than a shallow gully below an overhanging ledge the companions stumbled gratefully into it here they were protected against the worst battering of the wind and snow but the cold still gripped them and no sooner had they halted than their bodies seemed to stiffen and they moved arms and legs only with the greatest difficulty they clung together for warmth and pressed against llyans thick coat of fur even this gave them little comfort for as night fell the chill deepened taran stripped off his cloak and covered eilonwy and achren gurgi insisted on adding his sheepskin jacket and he crouched with his shaggy arms wrapped around himself his teeth chattering loudly i fear that achren will not live the night taran murmured to fflewddur she was too close to death when we found her she will not have strength to stand such cold will any of us answered the bard without a fire we might just as well say farewell to each other right now i dont know what youre complaining about eilonwy sighed ive never been so comfortable in all my life taran looked at her in alarm the girl did not stir under the cloak her eyes were halfshut her voice faltered with drowsiness quite warm she rambled on happily what a lovely goosefeather quilt i have how odd i dreamed we were all caught in a terrible storm it wasnt pleasant at all or am i still dreaming no matter when i wake up it will all be gone away taran his face drawn with anxiety shook her roughly dont sleep he cried if you sleep it will be your death eilonwy did not answer him but only turned her head away and closed her eyes gurgi had curled up beside her and could not be roused taran himself felt a fatal drowsiness spreading over him fire he said we must build a fire from what doli brusquely replied theres not a twig to be found in this wilderness what will you burn our boots our cloaks well freeze all the faster he flickered back into sight and if im going to freeze i wont do it with hornets buzzing in my ears fflewddur who had been silent this while reached behind him and unslung his harp at this doli gave a furious shout harp music he cried my friend your wits are frozen solid as ice it shall give us the tune we need replied fflewddur taran dragged himself to the side of the bard fflewddur what do you mean to do the bard did not answer for a long moment he held the harp lovingly in his hands and gently touched the strings then with a quick motion raised the beautiful instrument and smashed it across his knee taran cried out in anguish as the wood shattered into splinters and the harp strings tore loose with a discordant burst of sound fflewddur let the broken fragments drop from his hands burn it he said it is wood wellseasoned taran seized the bard by the shoulders what have you done he sobbed gallant foolish fflam you have destroyed your harp for the sake of a moments warmth we need a greater fire than this wood can ever give us doli however had quickly taken flint from his pouch and had struck a spark into the pitiful heap of splinters instantly the wood blazed up and sudden warmth poured over the companions taran stared amazed at the rising flames the bits of wood seemed hardly to be consumed yet the fire burned all the more brightly gurgi stirred and raised his head his teeth had ceased their chattering and color was returning to his frostpinched face eilonwy too sat up and looked about her as though waking from a dream at a glance she understood what fuel the bard had offered and tears sprang to her eyes dont give it a second thought cried fflewddur the truth of the matter is that im delighted to be rid of it i could never really play the thing and it was more a burden than anything else great belin i feel light as a feather without it believe me i was never meant to be a bard in the first place so all is for the best in the depths of the flame several harp strings split in two and a puff of sparks flew into the air but it gives a foul smoke fflewddur muttered though the fire was burning clear and brilliant it makes my eyes water horribly the flames had now spread to all the fragments and as the harp strings blazed a melody sprang suddenly from the heart of the fire louder and more beautiful it grew and the strains of music filled the air echoing endlessly among the crags dying the harp seemed to be pouring forth all the songs ever played upon it and the sound shimmered like the fire all night the harp sang and its melodies were of joy sorrow love and valor the fire never abated and little by little new life and strength returned to the companions and as the notes soared upward a wind rose from the south parting the falling snow like a curtain and flooding the hills with warmth only at dawn did the flame sink into glowing embers and the voice of the harp fall silent the storm had ended the crags glistened with melting snow wordless and wondering the companions left their shelter fflewddur lingered behind for a moment of the harp nothing remained but a single string the one unbreakable string which gwydion had given the bard long ago fflewddur knelt and drew it from the ashes in the heat of the fire the harp string had twisted and coiled around itself but it glittered like pure gold chapter mount dragon as doli had foretold llassar had led the warriors to shelter in a cave and had saved them from the full fury of the snowstorm the companions now made ready to continue their journey the sharp crags that were their last obstacle lay not far distant the crest of mount dragon loomed dark and forbidding with the help of tarans healing potions and eilonwys care achren had regained consciousness fflewddur was still reluctant to come within fewer than three paces of the blackrobed queen but gurgi had finally taken enough courage to open his wallet and offer food to the halfstarved woman although the creatures face wrinkled uneasily and he held out the morsels at arms length as if fearful of being bitten achren however ate sparingly glew for his part lost no time in snatching up what remained popping it into his mouth and glancing about to see whether more might be forthcoming achrens fever had left her weakened in body yet her face had lost none of its haughtiness and after taran had briefly recounted what had brought the companions so close to annuvin it was with illdisguised scorn that she answered him does a pigkeeper and his shabby followers hope to triumph where a queen failed i would have reached annuvin long since had it not been for magg and his warriors by chance his war band came upon me in cantrev cadiffor her broken lips drew back in a bitter grimace they left me for dead i heard magg laugh when they told him i had been slain he too shall know my vengeance yes i lay in the forest like a wounded beast but my hatred was sharper than their sword thrusts i would have crept after them on hands and knees and given my last strength to strike them down though indeed i feared that i would die unrevenged but i found refuge there are still those in prydain who pay homage to achren until i could journey once again they sheltered me and for that service they shall be rewarded yet i failed even within sight of my goal the gwythaints were more ruthless than magg they would have made certain of my death i who once commanded them sharp will be their punishment i have the awful feeling eilonwy whispered to taran that achren sometimes thinks shes still queen of prydain not that i mind so long as she doesnt take it into her head to try to punish us achren overhearing eilonwys remarks turned to the girl forgive me princess of llyr she said quickly i spoke half in a rambling dream and the cold comforts of memory i am grateful to you for my life and shall repay you far beyond its worth hear me well would you pass the mountain bastions of annuvin you follow the wrong path humph doli cried popping visible for a moment dont tell one of the fair folk hes on the wrong path yet it is true achren replied there are secrets unknown even to your people its no secret that if you cross mountains you choose the easiest way doli snapped back and thats what i plan im taking my bearings from mount dragon but you can believe me once were closer well turn aside and find a passage through the lower slopes do you think im such a fool as to do otherwise achren smiled contemptuously in so doing dwarf you would indeed be a fool of all the peaks surrounding annuvin mount dragon alone can be breached heed me she added as taran murmured in disbelief the crags are lures and traps others have been deceived and their bones lie in the pitfalls the lower mountains beckon with promise of easier passage but no sooner are they crossed than they fall away into sheer cliffs does mount dragon warn you to shun its heights the western descent is a very roadway to the iron portals of annuvin to reach it there is a hidden trail where i shall guide you taran looked closely at the queen such are your words achren do you ask us to stake our lives on them achrens eyes glittered in your heart you fear me pigkeeper but which do you fear the more the path i offer you or the certain death of lord gwydion do you seek to overtake arawns cauldron warriors this you can not do for time will defeat you unless you follow where i lead this is my gift to you pigkeeper scorn it if you choose and we shall go our separate ways achren turned and muffled herself with her ragged cloak the companions drew away from her and spoke among themselves doll thoroughly vexed and disgruntled by achrens judgment of his skill nonetheless admitted that he could have unwittingly led them astray we fair folk have never dared to journey here and i cant prove what she says one way or the other but ive seen mountains that look sheer on one side and on the other you could roll down without so much as a bump so she could be telling the truth and she could be trying to get rid of us the fastest way she knows the bard put in those pitfalls with bones in them make my flesh creep i think achren would be delighted if some of those bones were ours shes playing her own game you can be sure of that he shook his head uneasily a fflam is fearless but with achren i prefer being wary taran was silent a moment searching for the wisdom to choose one way or the other and again felt the weight of the burden gwydion had set upon him to be more than he could bear achrens face was a pallid mask he could read nothing of her heart in it more than once the queen would have taken the lives of the companions but as he knew she had served dallben well and faithfully after her own powers had been shattered i believe he said slowly that we can do no less than trust her until she gives us clear reason to doubt i fear her he added as do all of us yet i will not let fear blind me to hope i agree said eilonwy which makes me think in this case at least your judgment is quite right i admit that trusting achren is like letting a hornet sit on your nose but sometimes you only get stung when you try to brush it off the hornet i mean taran went to achrens side lead us to mount dragon he said we will follow you another days travel brought the companions across a harsh uneven valley that lay within the shadow of mount dragon itself the summit had been well named for taran saw its peak was in the rough shape of a monstrous crested head with gaping jaws and on either side the lower slopes spread like outflung wings the great blocks and shafts of stone that rose to form its jagged bulk were dark mottled with patches of dull red before this last barrier poised as though to swoop downward and crush them the companions fearfully halted achren strode to the head of the waiting column and beckoned them onward there are other easier paths achren said as they entered a narrow defile that twisted between towering walls of sheer cliffs but they are longer and those who travel them can be seen before they reach the stronghold of annuvin this one is known only to arawn and his most trusted servants and to me for it was i who showed him the secret ways of mount dragon taran however soon began to fear achren had deceived them for the path rose so steeply that men and horses could barely keep their footing achren seemed to be leading them deep into the heart of the mountain mighty shelves of overhanging rocks rose like arches above the toiling band blotting the sky from their sight at times the path skirted yawning chasms and more than once taran stumbled buffeted by a sudden chill blast that flung him against the walls his heart pounded and his head reeled at the sight of the deep gorges opening at his feet and terrified he clung to the sharp edges of jutting rocks achren whose step did not falter only turned and silently glanced at him a mocking smile on her ravaged face the path continued to rise though not so abruptly for it no longer followed the slope of the mountain but seemed almost to double back on itself and the companions gained the higher reaches of the trail only by small degrees the huge stone jaws of the dragons head loomed above the trail which for some of its course had been hidden by grotesque formations of rocks now lay exposed and taran could see most of the mountain slope dropping sharply below him they were almost at the highest ridge of the dragons shoulder and it was there that kaw scouting ahead returned to them and clacked his beak frantically gwydion gwydion the crow jabbered at the top of his voice annuvin haste taran sprang past achren and raced to the ridge clambering upward among the rocks straining his eyes for a glimpse of the stronghold had the sons of don already begun their attack on annuvin had gwydions warriors themselves overtaken the cauldronborn his heart pounding against his ribs he struggled higher suddenly the dark towers of arawns fastness were below him beyond the high walls beyond the massive iron portals ugly and brooding he glimpsed the spreading courtyards the hall of warriors where once the black cauldron had stood arawns great hall rose glittering like black polished marble and above it at the highest pinnacle floated the deathlords banner the sight of annuvin sickened him with the chill of death that hung over it his head spun and shadows seemed to blind him he pressed higher struggling shapes filled the courtyard the clash of blades and shouted battle cries struck his ears men were scaling the western wall dark gate itself had been breached and taran believed he saw the flash of melyngars white flanks and golden mane and the tall figures of gwydion and taliesin the commot men had not failed arawns deathless host had been held back and victory was in gwydions hands but even as taran turned to shout the joyous tidings his heart froze southward he glimpsed the hastening army of cauldronborn their ironshod boots rang and clattered as the mute warriors raced toward the heavy gates and the horns of the troop captains shrieked for vengeance taran leaped from the ridge to join the companions the shelf of stone crumbled at his feet he pitched forward eilonwys scream rang in his ears and the sharp rocks seemed to whirl upward against him desperately he clutched at them and strove to break his fall with all his strength he clung to the sheer side of mount dragon while jagged stones bit like teeth into his palms his sword ripped from his belt clattered into the gorge he saw the horrified faces of the companions above him and knew he was beyond their reach his muscles trembling his lungs bursting with his efforts he fought to climb upward to the path his foot slipped and he twisted about to regain his balance it was then that he saw plunging from the peak of mount dragon the gwythaint speeding toward him chapter the deathlord the gwythaint greater than any taran had ever seen screamed and beat its wings churning a wind like a gale of death taran saw the curved gaping beak and bloodred eyes and in another instant the gwythaints talons sank into his shoulders seeking to grip the flesh beneath his cloak the relentless bird pressed so closely that the reek of its feathers filled tarans nostrils its head deeply scarred by an old wound thrust against him taran turned his face away and waited for the beak to rend his throat yet the gwythaint did not strike instead it was pulling him from the rocks with a strength taran could not resist the gwythaint no longer screamed but made soft keening sounds and the birds eyes fixed upon him not in fury but in a strange gaze of recognition the bird seemed to be urging him to loosen his grasp a sudden memory from his boyhood flooded taran and again he saw a fledgling gwythaint in a thorn bush a young bird wounded and dying was this the ragged bundle of feathers he had nursed back to life had the creature come at last to pay a debt so long remembered taran dared not hope yet as he clung weakening to the side of mount dragon it was his only hope he relaxed his grip and let himself fall free the weight of its burden made the gwythaint falter and drop earthward for a moment below taran the crags reeled with all its strength the huge bird beat its wings and taran felt himself borne upward higher and higher as the wind whistled in his ears its black wings heaving and straining the gwythaint pressed steadily aloft until at last its talons opened and taran fell to the stonecrested peak of mount dragon achren had spoken the truth the short downward slope lay before him clear and unhindered to the iron portals which now swung open as the hastening army of cauldronborn streamed into annuvin the deathless host had drawn their swords within the stronghold gwydions warriors had seen the foe and shouts of despair rose from the embattled sons of don a troop of cauldronborn sighting the lone figure of taran atop the mountains summit and the companions who now had crossed the ridge broke from the main body of the host and turned their attack upon mount dragon brandishing their weapons they sped up the slope the gwythaint circling overhead screamed a war cry sweeping its wings the giant bird flew straight to the onrushing warriors and plunged into their ranks striking out with beak and claws under the violence of the gwythaints unexpected charge the first rank of cauldronborn fell back and stumbled to the ground but one of the mute warriors lashed out with his sword striking again and again until the gwythaint dropped at his feet the huge wings fluttered and trembled then the battered body lay still three of the cauldronborn had leaped past their comrades and raced toward taran who read his own death in their livid faces his eyes darted about the summit vainly seeking a last means of defense at the highest peak of the dragons crest rose a tall rock time and tempest had gnawed it into a grotesque shape the wind blowing through the eroded crannies and hollows set up a baleful keening and the stone shrieked and moaned as if with human tongue the weird wail seemed to command to beseech to draw taran closer here was his only weapon he flung himself against the rock and wrestled against the unyielding bulk struggling to uproot it the cauldronborn were nearly upon him the stone crest seemed to move a little as taran redoubled his efforts then suddenly it rolled from its socket with a final heave taran sent it crashing amid his assailants two of the cauldronborn tumbled backward and their blades spun from their hands but the third warrior did not falter in his upward climb driven by despair as a man casts pebbles at the lightning that would strike him down taran groped for a handful of stones of loose earth even a broken twig to fling in defiance of the cauldron warrior who strode closer blade upraised the socket from which the dragons crest had been torn was lined with flat stones and in it as in a narrow grave lay dyrnwyn the black sword taran snatched it up for an instant his mind reeling he did not recognize the blade once long before he had sought to draw dyrnwyn and his life had been almost forfeit to his rashness now heedless of the cost seeing no more than a weapon come to his hand he ripped the sword from its sheath dyrnwyn flamed with a white and blinding light it was only then in some distant corner of his mind taran dimly understood that dyrnwyn was blazing in his grasp and that he was still alive dazzled the cauldronborn dropped his sword and flung his hands to his face taran leaped forward and with all his strength drove the blazing weapon deep into the warriors heart the cauldronborn stumbled and fell and from lips long mute burst a shriek that echoed and reechoed from the deathlords stronghold as though rising from a thousand tongues taran staggered back the cauldronborn lay motionless along the path and at the iron portals the cauldron warriors toppled as one body within the stronghold the deathless men locked in combat with the sons of don screamed and crumpled to earth even as tarans foe had fallen a troop hastening to fill the breach at dark gate pitched headlong at the feet of gwydions warriors and those who strove to slay the soldiers at the western wall dropped in midstride and their weapons clattered on the stones death at last had overcome the deathless cauldronborn shouting for the companions taran raced from the peak of mount dragon the commot horsemen leaped to their saddles and urged their steeds to a gallop plunging after taran and into the fray taran sped across the courtyard at the death of the cauldronborn many of arawns mortal guards threw down their weapons and sought vainly to flee the stronghold others fought with the frenzy of men whose lives were already lost and the remaining huntsmen who had gained new strength as their comrades fell under the blades of the sons of don still shouted their war cry and flung themselves against gwydions warriors one of the huntsmen troop captains his branded face twisted in rage slashed at taran then shouted in horror and fled at the sight of the flaming sword taran fought his way through the press of warriors that swirled about him and raced toward the great hall where he had first glimpsed gwydion he burst through the portals and as he did so sudden fear and loathing plucked at him torches flared along the dark glittering corridors for a moment he faltered as though a black wave had engulfed him from the far end of the corridor gwydion had seen him and he strode quickly to tarans side taran ran to meet him shouting triumphantly that dyrnwyn had been found sheathe the blade gwydion cried shielding his eyes with a hand sheathe the blade or it will cost your life taran obeyed gwydions face was drawn and pale his greenflecked eyes burned feverishly how have you drawn this blade pigkeeper gwydion demanded my hands alone dare touch it give me the sword the voice of gwydion rang harsh and commanding yet taran hesitated his heart pounding with a strange dread quickly gwydion ordered will you destroy what i have fought to win arawns treasure trove lies open to our hands and power greater than any man has dreamed awaits us you will share with me in it pigkeeper i trust no other shall some baseborn warrior keep these treasures from us gwydion cried arawn has fled his realm pryderi is slain and his army scattered none has strength to stand against us now give me the sword pigkeeper half a kingdom is in your grasp seize it now before it is too late gwydion reached out his hand taran flung himself back his eyes wide with horror lord gwydion this is not the counsel of a friend it is betrayal only then as he stared bewildered at this man he had honored since boyhood did he understand the ruse in another instant taran ripped dyrnwyn from its sheath and raised the glittering blade arawn taran gasped and swung the weapon downward before the blade struck home the deathlords disguised shape blurred suddenly and vanished a shadow writhed along the corridor and faded away the companions now pressed into the great hall and taran hurried toward them crying the warning that arawm still lived and had escaped achrens eyes blazed with hatred escaped you pigkeeper but not my vengeance the secret chambers of arawn are no secret to me i shall seek him out wherever he has taken refuge without waiting for the companions who ran to follow her achren set off with all speed down the winding halls she sprang past a heavy portal which bore the deathlords seal branded deeply in the ironstudded wood at the far end of the long chamber taran glimpsed a hunched spidery figure scuttling to a high skullshaped throne it was magg the chief stewards face was ghastly white his lips trembled and slavered and his eyes rolled in his head he stumbled to the foot of the throne snatched at an object that lay on the flagstones clutched it to him and whirled to face the companions no closer shrieked magg in such a tone that even achren halted and taran about to draw dyrnwyn from its scabbard was gripped in horror at maggs contorted features will you keep your lives magg cried to your knees then humble yourselves and beg mercy i magg shall favor you by making you my slaves your master has abandoned you replied taran and your own treachery has ended he strode forward maggs spidery hands thrust out in warning and taran saw that the chief steward held a strangely wrought crown i am master here magg shouted i magg lord of annuvin arawn pledged that i should wear the iron crown has it slipped from his fingers it is mine mine by right and promise he has gone mad taran murmured to fflewddur who stared in revulsion as the chief steward raised high the crown and gibbered to himself help me take him prisoner no prisoner shall he be cried achren drawing a dagger from her cloak his life is mine for the taking and he shall die as all who have betrayed me my vengeance begins here with a treacherous slave and next his master harm him not commanded taran as the queen struggled to make her way past him to the throne let him find justice from gwydion achren fought against him but eilonwy and doli hastened to hold the raging queens arms taran and the bard strode toward magg who flung himself to the seat of the throne do you tell me arawns promises are lies the chief steward hissed fondling and fingering the heavy crown it was promised i should wear this now it is given into my hands so shall it be quickly magg lifted the crown and set it on his brow magg he shouted magg the magnificent magg the deathlord the chief stewards triumphant laughter turned to a shriek as he clawed suddenly at the ironband circling his forehead taran and fflewddur gasped and drew back the crown glowed like red iron in a forge writhing in agony magg clutched vainly at the burning metal which now had turned white hot and with a last scream toppled from the throne eilonwy cried out and turned her face away gurgi and glew had lost track of the companions and were now pelting through the maze of winding corridors trying vainly to find them gurgi was terrified at being in the heart of annuvin and at every step shouted tarans name only the echoes from the torchlit halls came back to him glew was no less fearful between gasps the former giant also found enough breath to complain bitterly its too much to bear he cried too much is there no end to the wretched burdens put upon me thrown aboard a ship hustled off to caer dallben half frozen to death dragged through mountains at the risk of my life a fortune snatched from my hands and now this oh when i was a giant id not have stood for such highhanded treatment oh giant leave off pinings and whinings replied gurgi miserable enough at being separated from the companions gurgi is lost and lorn but he tries to find kindly master with seekings do not fear he added reassuringly though it was all he could do to keep his voice from trembling bold gurgi will keep plaintful little giant safe oh yes youre not doing very well at it snapped glew nevertheless the pudgy little man clung to the side of the shaggy creature and his stubby legs pumping matched him stride for stride they had come to the end of one corridor where a squat and heavy iron portal stood open gurgi fearfully halted a bright cold light poured from the chamber gurgi took a few cautious paces and peered within beyond the doorway stretched what seemed to be an endless tunnel the light came from heaps of precious stones and golden ornaments farther on he glimpsed strange objects halfhidden by shadows gurgi drew back his eyes popping in wonder and terror oh it is treasure house of evil deathlord he whispered oh glimmerings and shimmerings this is a very secret place and fearsome and not wise for bold gurgi to stay glew however pressed forward and at the sight of the gems his pale cheeks twitched and his eyes glittered treasure indeed he said choking in his excitement ive been cheated of one fortune but now ill be repaid its mine he cried all of it i spoke first no one shall deprive me of it no no protested gurgi it can not be yours greedy giant it is for mighty prince to give or take come with hastenings and seek companions even faster come with tellings and warnings for gurgi also fears snappings and trappings costly treasures without guardings no no clever gurgi sniffs evil enchantments heedless of the creatures words glew thrust him aside with an eager cry the former giant sprang past the threshold and into the tunnel where he plunged his hands into the largest heap of jewels gurgi seizing him by the collar tried vainly to drag him back as flames burst from the walls of the treasuretrove before the great hall of annuvin gwydion rallied the last survivors of the sons of don and the commot horsemen there the companions with kaw squawking jubilantly overhead joined them for a moment taran stared searchingly at gwydion but his doubts vanished when the tall warrior strode quickly to him and clasped his hand we have much to tell each other gwydion said but no time for the telling though annuvin is in our hands the deathlord himself has escaped us he must be found and slain if it is in our power to do so gurgi and glew are lost in the great hall taran said give us leave to find them first go quickly then answered gwydion if the deathlord is still in annuvin their lives are in as much danger as ours taran had unbuckled dyrnwyn from his belt and held out the sword to gwydion i understand now why arawn sought possession of it not for his own use but because he knew it threatened his power only dyrnwyn could destroy his cauldronborn indeed he dared not even keep it in his stronghold and believed it harmless buried atop mount dragon when arawn disguised himself in your shape he nearly tricked me into giving him the weapon take it now the blade is safer in your hands gwydion shook his head you have earned the right to draw it assistant pigkeeper he said and thus the right to wear it indeed so put in fflewddur it was magnificent the way you struck down that cauldronborn a fflam couldnt have done better were rid of those foul brutes forever taran nodded yet i hate them no longer it was not their wish to bend in slavery to anothers will now they are at peace in any case hen wens prophecy came true after all fflewddur said not that i ever doubted it for a moment he glanced instinctively over his shoulder but this time there came no jangling of harp strings but she did have a curious way of putting things i still havent heard any stones speaking i have answered taran atop mount dragon the sound from the crest was like a voice without it id have paid no heed to the stone then when i saw how hollowed and eaten away it was i believed i might be able to move it yes fflewddur the voiceless stone spoke clearly i suppose so if you think about it in that way eilonwy agreed as for dyrnwyns flame being quenched hen was quite mistaken understandably she was very upset at the time before the girl could finish two frightened figures burst from the great hall and raced to the companions much of gurgis hair had been singed away in ragged patches his shaggy eyebrows were charred and his garments still smouldered the former giant had fared worse for he seemed little more than a heap of grime and ashes taran had no time to welcome the lost companions for the voice of achren rose in a terrible cry do you seek arawn he is here achren flung herself at tarans feet taran gasped and froze in horror behind him coiled a serpent ready to strike taran sprang aside dyrnwyn flashed from its scabbard achren had clutched the serpent in both hands as though to strangle or tear it asunder the head of the snake darted toward her the scaly body lashed like a whip and the fangs sank deep into achrens throat with a cry she fell back in an instant the serpent coiled again its eyes glittered with a cold deadly flame hissing in rage jaws gaping and fangs bared the serpent shot forward striking at taran eilonwy screamed taran swung the flashing sword with all his strength the blade clove the serpent in two flinging dyrnwyn aside taran dropped to his knees beside gwydion who held the limp body of the queen the blood had drained from achrens lips and her glazed eyes sought gwydions face have i not kept my oath gwydion she murmured smiling vaguely is the lord of annuvin slain it is good my death comes easily upon me achrens lips parted as though she would speak again but her head fell back and her body sagged in gwydions arms a horrified gasp came from eilonwy taran looked up as the girl pointed to the cloven serpent its body writhed its shape blurred in its place appeared the blackcloaked figure of a man whose severed head had rolled face downward on the earth yet in a m ment this shape too lost its form and the corpse sank like a shadow into the earth and where it had lain was seared and fallow the ground wasted fissured as though by drought arawn deathlord had vanished the sword cried fflewddur look at the sword quickly taran caught up the blade but even as he grasped the hilt the flame of dyrnwyn flickered as though stirred by a wind the white brilliance dimmed like a dying fire faster then the glow faded no longer white but filled with swirling colors which danced and trembled in another moment tarans hand held no more than a scarred and battered weapon whose blade glinted dully not from the flame that once had burned within it but only from the mirrored rays of the setting sun eilonwy hurrying to his side called out the writing on the scabbard is fading too at least i think it is unless its just the dim light here let me see better she drew the bauble from her cloak and brought it closer to the black scabbard suddenly in the golden rays the marred inscription glittered my bauble brightens the lettering theres more than what used to be there cried the surprised girl even the part that was scratched out i can see most of it now the companions hastily gathered and while eilonwy held the bauble taliesin took the scabbard and scanned it closely the writing is clear but fading quickly he said indeed princess your golden light shows what was hidden draw dyrnwyn only thou of noble worth to rule with justice to strike down evil who wields it in good cause shall slay even the lord of death in another moment the inscription had vanished taliesin turned the black scabbard back and forth in his hands perhaps now i understand what was only hinted in the lore that once a mighty king came upon great power and strove to use it for his own advantage i believe dyrnwyn was that weapon turned from its destiny long lost and found again dyrnwyns task is ended gwydion said let us leave this evil place in death the face of achren no longer bitterly haughty was at last tranquil shrouding the woman in her tattered black cloak the companions bore the body to rest in the great hall for she who had once ruled prydain had died not without honor at the pinnacle of the deathlords tower the dark banner suddenly burst into flames and fell away in blazing shreds the walls of the great hall trembled and the stronghold shuddered deep within itself the companions and the warriors rode from the iron portals behind them the walls shattered and the mighty towers crumbled a sheet of flame reached skyward from the ruins where annuvin had stood chapter the gift they were home again gwydion had led the companions westward to the coast where the golden ships waited from there with kaw proudly perched on the highest mast the great vessels with their gleaming sails bore them to avren harbor word of arawns destruction had spread swiftly and even as the companions disembarked many cantrev lords and their battle hosts gathered to follow the sons of don to do homage to king gwydion and to cry greetings to the commot folk and taran wanderer gurgi unfurled what remained of the banner of the white pig and raised it triumphantly yet gwydion had been strangely silent and taran as the little farm came into sight felt more heartache than joy the winter had broken thawing earth had begun to stir and the first hardly visible traces of green touched the hills like a faint mist but tarans eyes went to colls empty garden and he grieved afresh for the stout grower of turnips far distant in his lonely resting place dallben hobbled out to greet them the enchanters face had grown even more deeply lined his brow seemed fragile the wrinkled skin almost transparent seeing him taran sensed that dallben already knew coll would not return eilonwy ran to his outstretched arms taran leaping from the back of melynlas strode after her kaw flapped his wings and gabbled at the top of his voice fflewddur doli and gurgi who looked more than ever patchy and scraggly hastened to add their greetings attempting to tell dallben all at the same time what had befallen them hen wen was squealing grunting and wheezing and very nearly climbing over the bars of the pen as taran jumped into the enclosure to fling his arms about the delighted pig he suddenly heard shrill squeakings and his jaw dropped in surprise eilonwy who had hurried to the enclosure gave a joyful cry piglets six small pigs five white as hen wen and one black stood squealing on their hind legs beside their mother hen wen chuckled and grunted proudly we have had visitors said dallben one of them a very handsome boar during the winter when there was much stirring among the forest creatures he came seeking food and shelter and found caer dallben more to his liking than the woods he is roaming about somewhere now for he is still a little wild and unused to so many new arrivals great belin cried fflewddur seven oracular pigs taran my friend your tasks will be harder than they were in the hills of brangaledd dallben shook his head sturdy and healthy they are and as fine a litter as i have seen but their powers are no greater than those of any other pig which should be quite enough to satisfy them hen wens own gift began to fade when the letter sticks shattered and now is gone past recall it is for the best such power is a heavy burden for men as well as pigs and i daresay she is much happier now for two days the companions rested grateful and content to be together in the peacefulness of the little farm the sky had never seemed clearer filled with happier promise of spring or greater joy king smoit had arrived with his guard of honor and through a nights feasting the cottage rang with merriment next day dallben summoned the companions to his chamber where gwydion and taliesin already waited he peered deeply and kindly at all gathered there and when he spoke his voice was gentle these have been days of welcome he said but also days of farewell a questioning murmur rose from the companions taran with alarm looked searchingly at dallben fflewddur however clapped a hand to his sword and exclaimed i knew it would be so what task remains to be done have the gwythaints returned is a band of huntsmen still abroad have no fears a fflam stands ready gwydion smiled sadly at the excited bard not so gallant friend like the huntsmen the gwythaints have been destroyed yet it is true one task remains the sons of don their kinsmen and kinswomen must board the golden ships and set sail for the summer country the land from which we came taran turned to gwydion as though he had not grasped the high kings words how then he quickly asked not daring to believe he had heard aright the sons of don leave prydain must you sail now to what purpose how soon shall you return shall you not first rejoice in your victory our victory is itself the reason for our voyage gwydion answered this is a destiny long ago laid upon us when the lord of annuvin shall be overcome then must the sons of don depart forever from prydain no eilonwy protested not now of all times we can not turn from this ancient destiny gwydion replied king fflewddur fflam too must join us for he is kin to the house of don the bards face filled with distress a fflam is grateful he began and under ordinary circumstances i should look forward to a sea voyage but im quite content to stay in my own realm indeed dreary though it is ive found myself rather missing it taliesin spoke then it is not for you to choose son of godo but know that the summer country is a fair land fairer even than prydain and one where all hearts desires are granted llyan shall be with you a new harp you shall have i myself shall teach you the playing of it and you shall learn all the lore of the bards your heart has always been the heart of a true bard fflewddur fflam until now it was unready have you given up that which you loved most for the sake of your companions the harp that awaits you shall be all the more precious and its strings shall never break know this too taliesin added all men born must die save those who dwell in the summer country it is a land without strife or suffering where even death itself is unknown there is yet another destiny laid upon us dallben said as the sons of don must return to their own land so must there come an end to my own powers i have long pondered the message hen wens last letter stick might have given us it is clear to me now why the ash rods shattered they could not with stand such a prophecy which could only have been this not only shall the flame of dyrnwyn be quenched and its power vanish but all enchantments shall pass away and men unaided guide their own destiny i too voyage to the summer country dallben continued i do so with sorrow but with even greater joy i am an old man and weary and for me there shall be rest and a laying down of burdens which have grown all too heavy upon my shoulders doli alas must return to the realm of the fair folk and so must kaw the enchanter went on the wayposts are being abandoned king eiddileg will soon command the barring of all passages into his kingdom just as medwyn has already closed his valley forever to the race of men allowing only the animals to find their way to him doli bowed his head humph he snorted its about time to stop dealing with mortals only leads to trouble yes ill be glad enough to go back ive had my fill of goodolddoli this and goodolddoli that and goodolddoli would you mind turning invisible just once more the dwarf strove to look as furious as he could but there were tears in his bright red eyes even the princess eilonwy daughter of angharad must voyage to the summer country dallben said so it must be he went on as eilonwy gasped in disbelief at caer colur the princess gave up only the usage of her magical powers they are still within her as they have been handed down to all daughters of the house of llyr therefore must she depart however he went on quickly before eilonwy could interrupt there are others who have wellserved the sons of don faithful gurgi hen wen too in her own fashion and taran of caer dallben it is their reward that they may journey with us yes yes shouted gurgi all go to land of no sighings and no dyings he bounded joyously and waved his arms in the air shedding a good portion of what hair remained to him yes oh yes all together forever and gurgi too will find what he seeks wisdom for his poor tender head tarans heart leaped as he cried out eilonwys name and hastened to the side of the princess to take her in his arms we shall not part again in the summer country we shall be wed he stopped short if if that is your wish if you will wed an assistant pigkeeper well indeed replied eilonwy i wondered if youd ever get round to asking of course i will and if youd given half a thought to the question youd have already known my answer tarans head still spun from the enchanters tidings and he turned to dallben can this be true that eilonwy and i may voyage together dallben said nothing for a moment then he nodded it is true no greater gift lies in my power to grant glew snorted thats all very well bestowing neverending life right and left even on a pigl but no ones given a thought to me selfishness lack of consideration its plain that if that fair folk mine hadnt come tumbling down robbing me of my fortune i might add wed have taken a different path wed never have gone to mount dragon dyrnwyn would never have been found the cauldronborn never slain for all his indignation however the former giants brow puckered wretchedly and his lips trembled go by all means let me stay this ridiculous size i assure you when i was a giant yes yes gurgi shouted whining giant too has served even as he says it is not fair to leave him lone and lost in smallness and in treasure house of evil deathlord when all rich treasures fall in flames a life was saved from hot and hurtful blazings yes even glew has served though all unwitting dallben replied his reward shall be no less than yours in the summer country he may grow if he so desires to the stature of a man but do you tell me dallben said looking sternly at gurgi that he saved your life gurgi hesitated a moment before he could answer glew quickly spoke of course he didnt said the former giant a life was saved mine if he hadnt pulled me out of the treasure house id be no more than a cinder in annuvin at least youve told the truth giant cried fflewddur good for you great belin i think youve already grown a little taller gwydion stepped forward and gently put his hand on tarans shoulder our time is soon upon us he said quietly in the morning we shall depart make ready assistant pigkeeper that night taran drowsed fitfully the joy that so lightened his heart had strangely flown fluttering out of reach like a bird of brilliant plumage he could not lure back to his hand even thoughts of eilonwy of happiness awaiting them in the summer country could not regain it at last he rose from his pallet and stood uneasy by the chamber window the campfires of the sons of don had burned to ashes the full moon turned the sleeping fields to a sea of silver from far beyond the hills a voice began to lift in song faint but clear another joined it then still others taran caught his breath only once long ago in the fair folk realm had he heard such singing now more beautiful than he remembered the song swelled in a long flood of melody shimmering brighter than the moonbeams suddenly it ended taran cried out in sorrow knowing he would never hear its like again and perhaps in his own imaginings there echoed from every corner of the land the sound of heavy portals closing what sleepless my chicken said a voice behind him he turned quickly light filling the chamber dazzled him but as his vision cleared he saw three tall and slender figures two garbed in robes of shifting colors of white gold and flaming crimson and one hooded in a cloak of glittering black gems sparkled in the tresses of the first at the throat of the second hung a necklace of shining white beads taran saw their faces were calm beautiful to heartbreak and though the dark hood shadowed the features of the last taran knew she could be no less fair sleepless and speechless too said the middle figure tomorrow poor dear instead of dancing with joy hell be yawning your voices i know them well taran stammered barely able to speak above a whisper but your faces yes once have i seen them a time long past in the marshes of morva yet you can not be the same orddu orwen and orgoch of course we are my gosling orddu replied though its true whenever you met us before we were hardly at our best but good enough for the purpose orgoch muttered from the depths of her hood orven giggled girlishly and toyed with her beads you mustnt think we look like ugly old hags all the time she said only when the circumstances seem to require it why have you come taran began still baffled at the familiar tones of the enchantresses coming from such fair shapes do you too journey to the summer country orddu shook her head we are journeying but not with you salt air makes orgoch queasy though its very likely the only thing that does we travel to well anywhere you might even say everywhere you shall see no more of us nor we of you added orwen almost regretfully we shall miss you as much that is as we can miss anyone orgoch especially would have loved to well best not to dwell on that orgoch gave a most ungentle snort orddu meanwhile had unfolded a length of brightly woven tapestry and held it out to taran we came to bring you this my duckling she said take it and pay no heed to orgochs grumbling shell have to swallow her disappointment for lack of anything better i have seen this on your loom taran said more than a little distrustful why do you offer it to me i do not ask for it nor can i pay for it it is yours by right my robin answered orddu it does come from our loom if you insist on strictest detail but it was really you who wove it puzzled taran looked more closely at the fabric and saw it crowded with images of men and women of warriors and battles of birds and animals these he murmured in wonder these are of my own life of course orddu replied the pattern is of your choosing and always was my choosing taran questioned not yours yet i believed he stopped and raised his eyes to orddu yes he said slowly once i did believe the world went at your bidding i see now it is not so the strands of life are not woven by three hags or even by three beautiful damsels the pattern indeed was mine but here he added frowning as he scanned the final portion of the fabric where the weaving broke off and the threads fell unraveled here it is unfinished naturally said orddu you must still choose the pattern and so must each of you poor perplexed fledglings as long as thread remains to be woven but no longer do i see mine clearly taran cried no longer do i understand my own heart why does my grief shadow my joy tell me this much give me to know this as one last boon dear chicken said orddu smiling sadly when in truth did we really give you anything then they were gone chapter farewells through the remainder of the night taran did not move from the window the unfinished weaving lay at his feet by dawn a still greater number of commot folk and cantrev nobles came to throng the fields and hillsides around caer dallben for it had become known the sons of don were departing prydain and with them the daughters of don who had journeyed from the eastern strongholds at last taran stirred and made his way to dallbens chamber the companions were already gathered even doli who had flatly refused to set out for the fair folk realm without taking a last leave of each and every friend kaw quiet for once perched on the dwarfs shoulder glew seemed excited and pleased to be on his way taliesin and gwydion stood near dallben who had donned a heavy travel cloak and bore an ashwood staff under his arm the enchanter carried the book of three kindly master hasten shouted gurgi as llyan at fflewddurs side twitched her tail impatiently all are ready for floatings and boatings tarans eyes went to the faces of the companions to eilonwy who was watching him eagerly to the weathered features of gwydion and the face of dallben furrowed with wisdom never had he loved each of them more than at this moment he did not speak until he came to stand before the old enchanter never shall i have greater honor than the gift you offer me taran said the words came slowly yet he forced himself to continue last night my heart was troubled i dreamed that orddu no it was not a dream she was indeed here and i have seen for myself your gift is one i can not take gurgis yelping stopped short and he stared at taran with wide and unbelieving eyes the companions started and eilonwy cried out taran of caer dallben do you have any idea what youre saying has the flame of dyrnwyn scorched your wits suddenly her voice caught in her throat she bit her lips and turned quickly away i understand in the summer country we were to be wed do you still question my heart it has not changed it is your heart that has changed toward mine taran dared not look at eilonwy for his grief was too keen in him you are wrong princess of llyr he murmured i have long loved you and loved you even before i knew that i did if my heart breaks to part from our companions it breaks twice over to part from you yet so it must be i can not do otherwise think carefully assistant pigkeeper dallben said sharply once taken your choice can not be recalled will you dwell in sorrow instead of happiness will you refuse not only joy and love but neverending life taran did not answer for a long moment when at last he did his voice was heavy with regret yet his words were clear and unfaltering there are those more deserving of your gift than i yet never may it be offered them my life is bound to theirs coll son of collfrewrs garden and orchard lie barren waiting for a hand to quicken them my skill is less than his but i give it willingly for his sake the seawall at dinas rhydnant is unfinished taran continued before the king of monas burial mound i vowed not to leave his task undone from his jacket taran drew the fragment of pottery shall i forget annlaw clayshaper commot merin and others like it i can not restore life to llonio son of llonwen and those valiant folk who followed me never to see their homes again nor can i mend the hearts of widows and orphaned children yet if it is in my power to rebuild even a little of what has been broken this must i do the red fallows once were a fruitful place with labor perhaps they shall be so again he turned and spoke to taliesin caer dathyls proud halls lie in ruins and with them the hall of lore and the treasured wisdom of the bards have you not said that memory lives longer than what it remembers but what if memory be lost if there are those who will help me we will raise the fallen stones and regain the treasure of memory gurgi will help he will not voyage no no gurgi wailed he stays always he wants no gift that takes him from kindly master taran put a hand on the creatures arm you must journey with the others do you call me master obey me then in one last command find the wisdom you yearn for it awaits you in the summer country whatever i may find i must seek it here eilonwy bowed her head you have chosen as you must taran of caer dallben nor will i gainsay you dallben said to taran but only warn you the tasks you set yourself are cruelly difficult there is no certainty you will accomplish even one and much risk you will fail in all of them in either case your efforts may well go unrewarded unsung forgotten and at the end like all mortals you must face your death perhaps without even a mound of honor to mark your resting place taran nodded so be it he said long ago i yearned to be a hero without knowing in truth what a hero was now perhaps i understand it a little better a grower of turnips or a shaper of clay a commot farmer or a king every man is a hero if he strives more for others than for himself alone once he added you told me that the seeking counts more than the finding so too must the striving count more than the gain once i hoped for a glorious destiny taran went on smiling at his own memory that dream has vanished with my childhood and though a pleasant dream it was fit only for a child i am wellcontent as an assistant pigkeeper even that contentment shall not be yours dallben said no longer are you assistant pigkeeper but high king of prydain taran caught his breath and stared with disbelief at the enchanter you jest with me he murmured have i been prideful that you would mock me by calling me king your worth was proved when you drew dyrnwyn from its sheath dallben said and your kingliness when you chose to remain here it is not a gift i offer you now but a burden far heavier than any you have borne then why must i bear it cried taran i am an assistant pigkeeper and such have i always been it has been written in the book of three dallben answered and raised his hand for silence before taran could speak again i dared not tell you this to give you such knowledge would have defeated the prophecy itself until this very moment i was not sure you were the one chosen to rule indeed yesterday i feared you were not how then taran asked could the book of three deceive you no it could not dallben said the book is thus called because it tells all three parts of our lives the past the present and the future but it could as well be called a book of if if you had failed at your tasks if you had followed an evil path if you had been slain if you had not chosen as you did a thousand ifs my boy and many times a thousand the book of three can say no more than if until at the end of all things that might have been one alone becomes what really is for the deeds of a man not the words of a prophecy are what shape his destiny i understand now why you kept my parentage a secret taran said but shall i never be given to know it i did not keep it secret from you entirely through my own wish dallben answered nor do i keep it so now long ago when the book of three first came into my hands from its pages i learned that when the sons of don departed from prydain the high king would be one who slew a serpent who gained and lost a flaming sword who chose a kingdom of sorrow over a kingdom of happiness these prophecies were clouded even to me and darkest was the prophecy that he who would come to rule prydair would be one of no station in life long did i ponder these things dallben continued at last i left caer dallben to seek this future king and to hasten his coming for many years i searched yet all whom i questioned well knew their station whether shepherd or war leader cantrev lord or commot farmer the seasons turned kings rose and fell wars turned to peace and peace to war indeed on a certain time as many years ago as you yourself have years a grievous war was upon the land and i despaired of my quest and turned my steps once more toward caer dallben on that day i chanced to pass a field where a battle had raged many lay slain noble as well as humble folk even the women and children had not been spared from the forest nearby i heard a piercing cry an infant had been hidden among the trees as though his mother had sought at the last to keep him safe from his wrappings i could judge nothing of his parentage and only sensed with certainty that both mother and father lay upon that field of the slain here surely was one of no station in life an unknown babe of unknown kin i bore the child with me to caer dallben the name i gave him was taran i could not have told you of your parentage even had i wished to dallben continued for i knew it no more than you did my secret hope i shared only with two others lord gwydion and coll as you grew to manhood so our hopes grew though never could we be certain you were the child born to be high king until now my boy said dallben you were always a great perhaps what was written has come to pass gwydion said and now in truth we must say farewell the chamber was silent llyan sensing the bards distress nuzzled him gently the companions did not move it was glew who stepped forward and spoke first ive been carrying this with me ever since i was so shabbily hustled away from mona he said drawing from his jacket a small blue crystal which he pressed into tarans hand it reminded me of my cavern and those grand days when i was a giant but for some reason i dont want to be reminded of them any longer since i dont want it here take it as a small remembrance of me hes still hardly the most generous spirit in the world muttered fflewddur but ive no doubt its the first time hes ever given anybody anything great belin i swear the little fellows actually grown another inch doli had taken the handsomely crafted axe from his belt youll need this he told taran and it should serve you well in many tasks its fair folk quality my lad and youll not blunt it easily it can serve me no better than did its owner taran replied clasping the dwarfs hand and its metal can not be as true as your own heart good old doli humph the dwarf snorted furiously good old doli ive heard that somewhere before kaw on dolis shoulder bobbed up and down while taran gently ran a finger over the crows sleek feathers farewell kaw croaked taran farewell farewell to you taran answered smiling if i have despaired of teaching you good manners i have rejoiced in your bad ones you are a rogue and a scamp and a very eagle among crows llyan had padded up to rub her head affectionately against tarans arm which she did so vigorously that the enormous cat nearly knocked him off his feet bear my friend good company taran said stroking llyans ears cheer him with your purring when his spirits are low as i wish you might cheer me stray not far from him for even such a bold bard as fflewddur fflam is no stranger to loneliness fflewddur himself had drawn near and in his hand held the harp string he had taken from the fire the heat of the flame had caused the string to curl and twine in a curious pattern that seemed without beginning or end constantly changing as from one melody to another even as taran looked at it im afraid its all thats left of the old pot fflewddur said offering the string to taran truthfully im just as well pleased it was forever jangling and going out of tune he paused glanced behind him nervously and cleared his throat ah what i meant to say was that i shall miss those snapping strings no more than i shall miss them taran said remember me as well and fondly as i remember you have no fear cried the bard theres still songs to be sung and tales to be told a fflam never forgets alas alas wailed gurgi poor gurgi has nothing to give kindly master for fond rememberings woe and misery even wallet of crunchings and munchings now is empty the tearful creature suddenly clapped his hands together yes yes forgetful gurgi has one gift here here it is from burning treasure house of wicked deathlord bold gurgi seized it with catchings and snatchings but his poor tender head was so filled with fearful spinnings that he forgot with this gurgi drew from his leather pouch a small flame scarred battered coffer of unknown metal and held it out to taran who took it studied it curiously then broke the heavy seal which kept it locked the coffer held no more than a number of thin closely written parchments tarans eyes widened as he scanned them and he turned quickly to gurgi do you know what you have found he whispered here are the secrets of forging and tempering metals of shaping and firing pottery of planting and cultivating this is what arawn stole long ago and kept from the race of men this knowledge is itself a priceless treasure perhaps the most precious of all said gwydion who had come to study the parchments in tarans hand the flames of annuvin destroyed the enchanted tools that labored of themselves and would have given carefree idleness these treasures are far worthier for their use needs skill and strength of hand and mind fflewddur gave a low whistle who owns these secrets is truly master of prydain taran old friend the proudest cantrev lord will be at your beck and call begging for anything you choose to grant him and gurgi found it shouted gurgi springing into the air and madly whirling about yes oh yes bold clever faithful valiant gurgi always finds things once he found a lost piggy and once he found evil black cauldron now he finds mighty secrets for kindly master taran smiled at the excited gurgi indeed you have found many mighty secrets but they are not mine to keep these will i share with all in prydain for by right they belong to all then share this as well said dallben who had been listening closely and now held out the heavy leatherbound volume he had kept under his arm the book of three taran said looking wonderingly and questioningly at the enchanter i dare not take it my boy dallben said it will not blister your fingers as once it did with an overcurious assistant pigkeeper all its pages are open to you the book of three no longer foretells what is to come only what has been but now can be set down the words of its last page the enchanter took a quill from the table opened the book and in it wrote with a bold firm hand and thus did an assistant pigkeeper become high king o f prydain this too is a treasure said gwydion the book of three is now both history and heritage for my own gift i could give you nothing greater nor do i offer you a crown for a true king wears his crown in his heart the tall warrior clasped tarans hand farewell we shall not meet again take dyrnwyn then in remembrance of me taran said dyrnwyn is yours gwydion said as it was meant to be yet arawn is slain taran replied evil is conquered and the blades work done evil conquered said gwydion you have learned much but learn this last and hardest of lessons you have conquered only the enchantments of evil that was the easiest of your tasks only a beginning not an ending do you believe evil itself to be so quickly overcome not so long as men still hate and slay each other when greed and anger goad them against these even a flaming sword can not prevail but only that portion of good in all mens hearts whose flame can never be quenched eilonwy who had been standing in silence now drew close to taran the girls eyes did not waver from his as she held out the golden sphere take this she softly said though it does not glow as brightly as the love we might have shared farewell taran of caer dallben remember me eilonwy was about to turn away but suddenly her blue eyes flashed furiously and she stamped her foot its not fair she cried its not my fault i was born into a family of enchantresses i didnt ask for magical powers thats worse than being made to wear a pair of shoes that doesnt fit i dont see why i have to keep them princess of llyr said dallben i have waited for you yourself to say those words do you truly wish to give up your heritage of enchantment of course i do eilonwy cried if enchantments are what separates us then i should be well rid of them this lies within your power dallben said within your grasp and for the matter of that upon your finger the ring you wear the gift lord gwydion gave you long ago will grant your wish what eilonwy burst out in both surprise and indignation do you mean to say that all the years ive worn my ring i could have used it to have a wish granted you told me nothing of it thats worse than unfair why i could simply have wished to destroy the black cauldron or to find dyrnwyn i could have wished arawn conquered without the least danger and i never knew child child dallben interrupted your ring can indeed grant you a wish and one wish alone but evil can not be conquered by wishing the ring will serve only you and grant only the deepest wish of your own heart i did not tell you before because i was uncertain that you truly knew what you longed for turn the ring once upon your finger dallben said wish with all your heart for your enchanted powers to vanish wondering and almost fearful eilonwy closed her eyes and did the enchanters bidding the ring flared suddenly but only for a moment the girl gave a sharp cry of pain and in tarans hand the light of the golden bauble winked out it is done dallben murmured eilonwy blinked and looked around her i dont feel a bit different she remarked are my enchantments truly gone dallben nodded yes he said gently yet you shall always keep the magic and mystery all women share and i fear that taran like all men shall be often baffled by it but such is the way of it come clasp hands the two of you and pledge each other your troth when they had done so the companions pressed around the wedded couple to wish them happiness then gwydion and taliesin went from the cottage and dallben took up his ashwood staff we can tarry no longer the enchanter said and here our ways must part but what of hen wen taran asked shall i not see her one last time as often as you please answered dallben since she was free to go or stay i know she will choose to remain with you but i suggest you first let those visitors trampling about the fields see there is a new high king in prydain and a new queen gwydion will have proclaimed the tidings and your subjects will be impatient to hail you the companions following taran and eilonwy left the chamber but at the cottage door taran drew back and turned to dallben can one such as i rule a kingdom i remember a time when i jumped headfirst into a thorn bush and i fear kingship will be no different very likely more nettlesome put in eilonwy but should you have any difficulties ill be happy to give you my advice right now theres only one question are you going in or out of this doorway in the waiting throng beyond the cottage taran glimpsed hevydd llassar the folk of the commots gast and goryon side by side near the farmer aeddan king smoit towering above them his beard bright as flame but many were the wellloved faces he saw clearly only with his heart a sudden burst of cheering voices greeted him as he took eilonwys hand tightly in his own and stepped through the door and so they lived many happy years and the promised tasks were accomplished yet long afterward when all had passed away into distant memory there were many who wondered whether king taran queen eilonwy and their companions had indeed walked the earth or whether they had been no more than dreams in a tale set down to beguile children and in time only the bards knew the truth of it
